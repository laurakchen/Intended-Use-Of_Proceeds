expenses of this offering payable by us, we expect net proceeds from this
offering of approximately $5.5 million (or $6.5 million if the underwriters’
option to purchase additional common shares from us is exercised in full). The
net proceeds from this offering must be remitted to China before we will be able
to use the funds to grow our business. The procedure to remit funds may take
several months after completion of this offering, and we will be unable to use
the offering proceeds in China until remittance is completed. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows after we complete
the remittance process:

• approximately $5 million for the purchase of equipment and supplies including
  assembly line, process and testing equipment, membranes and modules, and the
  construction of our automatic DTRO membrane production line in Yantai City;

• approximately $500,000 in escrow for indemnity claims of the underwriters,
  which sum could be returned to us after two years from the date of this
  offering; and

• any balance for additional working capital.

The precise amounts and percentage of proceeds we devote to particular
categories of activity, and their priority of use, will depend on prevailing
market and business conditions as well as on the nature of particular
opportunities that may arise from time to time. Accordingly, we reserve the
right to change the use of proceeds that we presently anticipate and describe
herein. Pending remitting the offering proceeds to China, we intend to invest
our net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, and investment-grade
obligations.

Indemnification Escrow Agreement

We have agreed with the underwriters to establish an escrow account in the
United States and to fund such account with $500,000 from this offering that may
be utilized by the underwriters to fund any bona fide indemnification claims of
the underwriters arising during a two-year period following the offering. The
escrow account will not be interest bearing, and we will be free to invest the
assets in certain securities during the two-year period. All funds that are not
subject to an indemnification claim will be returned to us after the two-year
period expires."
REDFIN CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/redfin-corp-728338-84092,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/redfin-corp-728338-84092,424B4,7/28/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12196967,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of 9,231,000 shares of common
stock in this offering will be approximately $125.0 million, based on the 
initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, and after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock in full,
we estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately $144.3 million, after
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and provide
access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. We intend to
use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including technology and development and
marketing activities, general and administrative matters, and capital 
expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to invest in or
acquire third-party businesses, products, services, technologies, or other
assets. However, we do not currently have any definitive or preliminary plans
with respect to the use of proceeds for such purposes.

We currently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds that we
receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using
these proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds. Pending their use as described above,
we plan to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, or
direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."
"SIENNA BIOPHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/sienna-biopharmaceuticals-inc-977737-84118,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/sienna-biopharmaceuticals-inc-977737-84118,424B4,7/27/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12193840,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of 4,333,333 shares of common
stock in this offering will be approximately $57.5 million at the initial public
offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we
estimate that net proceeds will be approximately $66.5 million at the initial
public offering price of $15.00 per share after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash, as follows:

• approximately $27.0 million to fund the clinical development of SNA-120
  through top-line results in our Phase 2b trial;

• approximately $7.0 million to fund our preclinical and clinical studies for
  SNA-125 through receipt of proof of concept data in each of atopic dermatitis
  and psoriasis;

• approximately $20.0 million to fund our ongoing pivotal clinical trials for
  SNA-001 through receipt of top-line results; and

• the balance to fund internal research and development expenses and for working
  capital and general corporate purposes.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and
regulatory approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the
exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the
above purposes. As such, our management will retain broad discretion over the
use of the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including (i) the time and cost
necessary to advance our product candidates through our ongoing and planned
nonclinical studies and clinical trials; (ii) the time and cost associated with
our research and development activities; (iii) our ability to obtain regulatory
approval or clearance for and subsequently commercialize our product candidates;
and (iv) the time and cost necessary to develop nonclinical and clinical
supplies and a commercial-scale manufacturing process for product candidates, as
well as the infrastructure to commercialize our product candidates.

We believe that our existing cash, together with the net proceeds from this
offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least 12
months following the date of this offering. Following this offering, we will
require substantial capital in order to initiate our Phase 3 program for SNA-120
and our clinical program of SNA-125, as well as to complete the clinical
development, seek regulatory approval or clearance and commercialize any of our
current product candidates, as well as complete the nonclinical and clinical
development of any additional product candidates we choose to pursue.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    borrowed from our sponsor described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants
    available to us.                                                   

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private placement warrants.                                            

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at   
    approximately $2,000,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. 

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our sponsor, MasTec and EarlyBirdCapital have committed to purchase the
6,150,000, 2,000,000 and 1,350,000 private placement warrants from us for a
purchase price of $6,150,000, $2,000,000 and $1,350,000, respectively, on a
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.
Our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital have also agreed that if the over-allotment
option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they will purchase
from us on a pro rata basis up to an additional 1,012,500 private placement
warrants (up to 867,290 private placement warrants by the sponsor and up to
145,210 private placement warrants by EarlyBirdCapital) at a price of $1.00 per
warrant. These additional private placement warrants will be purchased in a
private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units
resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private placement
warrants are identical to the warrants being sold as part of the units in this
offering, subject to certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in this
prospectus. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed
in the trust account described below.

$270,000,000, or $310,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants
will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting the conditions of paragraph (d) under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until
the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our redemption of
100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business
combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

The payment to our sponsor of a monthly fee of an aggregate of up to $20,000 is
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our
benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated officers and
directors with compensation in lieu of a salary. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the
trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the up to $20,000 per month
fee, consulting fees payable to our Chief Financial Officer and the repayment of
loans from our sponsor (none of which payments will be made from the proceeds of
this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust
account prior to the completion of our initial business combination), no
compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, officers, directors or any
of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, such entity and individuals
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and
business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or
similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.
Our audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made
to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with
any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no
limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that
to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate
an initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$2,000,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our sponsor, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale
of the private placement warrants, including the funds held in the trust
account, to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto.
To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination (including to
pay converting stockholders as described herein) will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such
working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or
expanding the target business’s operations, for strategic acquisitions and for
marketing, research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account
and any available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we
are permitted to withdraw.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced us an aggregate of
$558,778 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA filing
fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the
legal and audit fees and expenses. The advances will be payable without interest
on the consummation of this offering. The advances will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants
available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of
the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. If we do not
complete a business combination, the loans will be forgiven.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer,
in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek
to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would stop our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares
to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of this
offering. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any
such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, whether
proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or
any other person. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $200,000,000 (or $230,000,000 
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full) as well as  
    amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in  
    connection with our successful completion of our initial business           
    combination.                                                                

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans  
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of   
    July 20, 2017, we had borrowed approximately $139,000 (of up to $300,000    
    available to us) under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a
    portion of the expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon 
    completion of this offering out of the $900,000 of offering proceeds that   
    has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than         
    underwriting commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than
    as set forth in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the 
    $1,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside
    for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering 
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be 
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, $7,000,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s       
    deferred commissions (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment     
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or       
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on           
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,  
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The        
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred   
    underwriting discounts and commissions.                                     

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be  
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or 
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For      
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial        
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business    
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur        
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement  
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a 
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and      
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of        
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current   
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for 
    our expenses.                                                               

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment   
    fees for financing.                                                         

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $204,000,000 (or $234,600,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $7,000,000 (or $8,050,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $1,600,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 0.80% per year; however, we can provide no assurance
regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from
the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation
of this offering. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay our sponsor a
total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and
administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of July
20, 2017, we had borrowed approximately $139,000 under the promissory note with
our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These
loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December
31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the
closing of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in
the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and NASDAQ rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination.                                       

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination
within 24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable
law and as further described herein and any limitations (including but not
limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$60.5 million (or approximately $72.6 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares from us in full), based on the initial
public offering price of $23.00 per share. We will not receive any proceeds from
the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling shareholders.

We intend to contribute $25 million of the net proceeds that we receive from
this offering to the Bank, and to use the remainder for general corporate
purposes, which could include future acquisitions and other growth initiatives.
We do not have any current specific plan for such remaining net proceeds, and do
not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings to make any material
acquisitions or to establish any de novo bank branches. Our management will
retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering. The
precise amounts and timing of our use of the proceeds will depend upon market
conditions, among other factors."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $8,750,000 which constitutes the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions (or $10,062,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us 
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the 
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately 
    $2,500,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in
    the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this offering; 
    however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate
    assumes an interest rate of 0.5% per annum based upon current yields of 
    securities in which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order
    to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
    combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our 
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may
    be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the 
    trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not 
    close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust 
    account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account
    would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans 
    may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at
    a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would 
    be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The 
    terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain
    of our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no 
    written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to 
    seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
    or certain of our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third
    parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any
    and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $250,000,000 (or $287,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $8,750,000 (or $10,062,500 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $1,250,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.5% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise
and income tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the
private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest
rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of
income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to 
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek 
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or 
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, 
or invest in, us.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

We intend
to use the gross proceeds of this offering to (i) pay off the Preference Notes
in the aggregate amount of $56.0 million and (ii) purchase 2,752,500 newly
issued LLC Interests from HoldCo at a purchase price per interest equal to
$16.00 per share. The value of the Preference Notes was determined by
multiplying the 3,497,500 sold or exchanged by the Continuing LLC Owners and
Certain Sponsors, as applicable, by $16.00. The Preference Notes will accrue
interest at a rate of two percent per annum and will be due and payable
immediately upon the consummation of this offering.

We intend to cause HoldCo to use the proceeds from the sale of the LLC
Interests: (i) to pay the underwriting discounts and commissions in connection
with this offering, (ii) to pay fees and expenses of approximately $4.5 million
in connection with the Transactions and this offering and (iii) to utilize
approximately $32.5 million for general corporate purposes.

In the event the option to purchase additional Class A shares is exercised, the
Company will purchase 66,667 shares of Class B common stock from each of
Christensen Ventures, LLC and Adcock Ventures LLC at a price per share equal to
the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock. Any
remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $80.7 million,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares of our common stock in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
from this offering will be approximately $93.3 million.

As of March 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of $36.0 million and $10.0 million of
available borrowings under our 2014 Debt Facility. We currently estimate that we
will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $25.0 million to fund clinical development of our KPI-121 
  product candidates, including preparation of NDA submissions for KPI-121 1.0%
  for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular 
  surgery and for KPI-121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and 
  symptoms of dry eye disease;

• approximately $30.0 million to prepare for commercialization of KPI-121 1.0% 
  and KPI-121 0.25%;

• approximately $20.0 million to support the manufacture of a commercial supply
  of KPI-121 product candidates;

• approximately $0.5 million to fund early stage pipeline development programs;
  and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, 
  including scheduled payments on existing indebtedness and funding the costs of
  operating as a public company.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions,
which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the
status of and results from clinical trials, the timing of regulatory submissions
and the outcome of regulatory review, as well as any collaborations that we may
enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen
cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and available borrowings described above, we estimate that such funds will
be sufficient to enable us to complete our NDA submission and prepare for 
commercial launch of KPI-121 1.0% for the treatment of post-operative
inflammation and pain following ocular surgery, complete our Phase 3 clinical
trials and complete our NDA submission of KPI-121 0.25% for the temporary relief
of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, fund early stage pipeline
development programs and fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements through the second quarter of 2019. We do not anticipate that the
net proceeds from this offering together with our existing cash and available
borrowings will be sufficient to allow us to complete preparation for commercial
launch of KPI-121 0.25% or fund additional clinical trials for our pipeline
development programs. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove
to be wrong, including assumptions regarding the clinical trials necessary for
FDA approval of our product candidates, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

$51.3 million, or approximately $59.2 million if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering (including any net proceeds
from the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of
common stock) as follows:

• approximately $20.0 million to fund research and for development costs to 
  advance our existing product candidates including high fiber wheat and    
  herbicide tolerant wheat and to add additional product candidates to our  
  portfolio;                                                                

• approximately $10.0 million to build out commercial capabilities, which   
  includes incremental expansion of our sales force to build commercial     
  relationships with supply chain and food companies, furnishing a demonstration
  kitchen, and producing demonstration and promotional products, such as high 
  oleic oil and meal samples, to help drive demand creation;

• approximately $10.0 million to be used as working capital related to seed 
  production, grain purchases and meal and oil production; and              

• the remainder for general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary products, technologies or businesses, although we currently have
no agreements or binding commitments to complete any such transaction.

The foregoing intended uses do not include our planned facility expansion as we 
intend to finance the building for the planned facility expansion in whole or in
part through a sale leaseback transaction. On June 20, 2017, we signed an 
agreement with a third party buyer for the sale of the land and warehouse 
facility. The completion of the sale is conditioned on us and the buyer entering
into a new facility construction agreement and a lease in respect of the 
property in the forms contemplated by the sale agreement. We expect to close on
the proposed transaction and construction to begin on the new facilities in the
second half of 2017.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process,
it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds
from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. The amount and
timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including
the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and success of
our ongoing field tests or field tests we may commence in the future and the
timing of regulatory submissions. As a result, our management will have broad
discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering, and investors
will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds.
In addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue certain activities or
field tests if the net proceeds from this offering and our other sources of cash
are less than expected.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to originate and acquire
our target assets in a manner consistent with our investment strategy and
investment guidelines described in this prospectus. We expect to fully deploy
the net proceeds from this offering in our target assets by the end of the first
quarter of 2018. However, there can be no assurance that we will use all or any
of such proceeds to originate or acquire our target assets by such time. The

available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments.

reasonably determined by our Manager to be of high quality and that are
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT and maintain our exclusion or
exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act. These investments
are expected to provide a lower net return than we seek to achieve from our
target assets. In addition, prior to the time we have fully invested the net
proceeds from this offering to originate or acquire our target assets, we may
temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under our secured revolving repurchase
facilities with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. Affiliates of
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, each an underwriter in this offering, are
lenders under our secured revolving repurchase facilities and would receive a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering to the extent amounts outstanding
under the applicable secured revolving repurchase facilities are temporarily
reduced with such net proceeds."

USCF will invest the Fund’s assets in Oil Interests. When the Fund takes short
positions in Oil Interests that are exchange-traded, the Fund will be required
to deposit typically 5% to 30% with the FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion
of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for
the obligation under the Oil Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as
initial margin. Counterparties in transactions in OTC contracts will generally
impose similar collateral requirements on the Fund. USCF will invest the Fund’s
assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in Treasuries, cash
and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral requirements,
USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that will be:

• held as margin or collateral with FCMs or other custodians;

• used for other investments; and

• held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

Approximately 15% to 90% of the Fund’s assets will be committed as margin for
commodity futures contracts. However, from time to time, the percentage of
assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range.
Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both
exchange-traded and OTC contracts based on changes in the value of the Oil
Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC
contracts are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market
volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the
counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Oil Interests, and each party’s
creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments
under exchange-traded and OTC contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing
margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of
the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The
Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves
that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All
interest income will be used for the Fund’s benefit. USCF invests the balance of
the Fund’s assets not invested in Oil Interests or held in margin as reserves to
be available for changes in margin. All interest income is used for the Fund’s
benefit.

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or exchange could increase margin or
collateral requirements applicable to the Fund to hold trading positions at any
time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the
profit or loss potential for any positions held.

The assets of the Fund posted as margin for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts
or other exchange-traded futures contracts will be held in segregation pursuant
to the CEA and CFTC regulations.

If the Fund enters into a swap agreement, it must post both collateral and
independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies). The amount of collateral the
Fund posts changes according to the amounts owed by the Fund to its counterparty
on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted
by the Fund at the start of a swap transaction. Collateral and independent
amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian."

Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading activities.
USCF will invest the Fund’s assets in Oil Interests. When the Fund purchases Oil
Interests that are exchange-traded, the Fund will be required to deposit
typically 5% to 30% with the FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the
value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the
obligation under the Oil Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial
margin. Counterparties in transactions in OTC contracts will generally impose
similar collateral requirements on the Fund. USCF will invest the Fund’s assets
that remain after margin and collateral is posted in Treasuries, cash and/or
cash equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral requirements, USCF has
sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that will be:

• held as margin or collateral with FCMs or other custodians;

• used for other investments; and

• held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

Approximately 15% to 90% of the Fund’s assets will be committed as margin for
commodity futures contracts. However, from time to time, the percentage of
assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range.
Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both
exchange-traded and OTC contracts based on changes in the value of the Oil
Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC
contracts are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market
volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the
counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Oil Interests, and each party’s
creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments
under exchange-traded and OTC contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing
margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of
the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The
Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves
that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All
interest income will be used for the Fund’s benefit. USCF invests the balance of
the Fund’s assets not invested in Oil Interests or held in margin as reserves to
be available for changes in margin. All interest income is used for the Fund’s
benefit.

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or exchange could increase margin or
collateral requirements applicable to the Fund to hold trading positions at any
time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the
profit or loss potential for any positions held.

The assets of the Fund posted as margin for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts
or other exchange-traded futures contracts will be held in segregation pursuant
to the CEA and CFTC regulations.

If the Fund enters into a swap agreement, it must post both collateral and
independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies). The amount of collateral the
Fund posts changes according to the amounts owed by the Fund to its counterparty
on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted
by the Fund at the start of a swap transaction. Collateral and independent
amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian."

    the $5,750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not
    to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are
    less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for
    post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the offering
    expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess
    with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $14,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or $16,100,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the
    funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released
    to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs
    or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a ""no-shop"" provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $400,000,000 (or $460,000,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $14,000,000 (or $16,100,000 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $1,000,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 0.25% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to fund our
working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of $750,000, and/or to
pay our franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering
and the sale of the private placement warrants will not be released from the
trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial
business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered
in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (c) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that the 
interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to
pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business in the healthcare industry or other industries
with which we ultimately complete our initial business combination. If our 
initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not
all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the 
consideration in connection with our initial business combination, we may apply
the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate 
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements
we may enter into following the consummation of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the 
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay our sponsor
a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial support
and administrative services. Upon completion of our initial business combination
or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up
to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
June 19, 2017, we had borrowed $150,000 under the promissory note with our
sponsor. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of September 30, 2017 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $5,000,000 of offering
proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $2,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender, to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Class A common stock.
The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as
to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such loans
by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from
parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we
do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may purchase shares or warrants in privately negotiated
transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business
combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to
engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for
any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make
any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public
information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by
Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such
purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer
rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the
going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine
at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules,
the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's ""penny stock"" rules) and the agreement for our initial business
combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth
or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their
redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement
or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption
of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business 
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in 
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of 
our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination
within 24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable 
law and as further described herein and any limitations (including but not 
limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business 
combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement
with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights
with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in
connection with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition,
our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder
shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

stock in this public offering will be approximately $115.0 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $8.00 per share, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares
in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this public offering will be
approximately $132.4 million, based on the initial public offering price of
$8.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. Our net proceeds from the concurrent
private placement will be approximately $50.0 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, as follows:

. approximately $80.0 million to complete planned Phase 3 development for
  volanesorsen in both FCS and FPL, including regulatory expenses for global
  marketing authorizations for FCS, and to support the launch and initial
  commercialization of volanesorsen for FCS, if approved;

. approximately $30.0 million to complete the planned Phase 2 program for
  AKCEA-APO(a)-L Rx;

. approximately $16.0 million to complete the planned Phase 2 program for
  AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx;

. approximately $24.0 million to complete the planned Phase 2 program for
  AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx; and

. the remainder for development personnel expenses, other development 
  activities, working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, the concurrent private 
placement and our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments,
together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at
least the next 12 months, including those activities listed above.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement represents our current intentions based upon our present plans
and business condition. We are also undertaking this offering in order to create
a public market for our common stock and thereby facilitate access to the public
equity markets, increase our visibility in the marketplace, obtain additional
capital, and increase our liquidity. Further, we may use a portion of the net
proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, or technologies,
although we have no present commitments or agreements for any specific
acquisitions.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the results of our development efforts, the results of our
ongoing nonclinical and clinical studies or nonclinical and clinical studies we
may commence in the future, feedback from regulatory agencies, the timing of
approval of any of our drugs and the results of any commercialization efforts.
We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other
purposes, our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net
proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement, and investors
will be relying on our judgement regarding the application of the aggregate net
proceeds.

Until any such net proceeds are used, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$7,018,685.

We expect the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to fund our
operations for up to 36 months, assuming no revenues from sales of our tests,
following the closing of the offering, including the completion of our planned
expansion of the number of tests we will offer to the public. We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

1. $2,000,000 for development of tests, expansion of laboratory facilities and
   clinical and in-field validation for regulatory filings of diagnostic tests;

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their    
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
    combination.                                                                 

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the      
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $300,000 in the aggregate that
    we may draw down as described in this prospectus. These loans will be repaid    
    upon completion of this offering out of the $460,000 of offering proceeds    
    that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than      
    underwriting commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than  
    set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing      
    working capital expenses.                                                    

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial       
    business combination, up to $1,750,000, which constitutes the underwriters’  
    deferred commissions (or up to $2,012,500 if the underwriters’ 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, such amount to be reduced pro rata
    based on the number of shares of common stock that are redeemed by our
    stockholders in connection with our business combination, and the remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.                                      

(4) Excludes $100,000 of legal fees that are due upon completion of the initial  
    business combination.                                                        

(5) Of the proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the private    
    placement units described in this prospectus, $50,750,000 or $58,362,500 if  
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.15 per     
    unit), will initially be deposited into a trust account with Continental     
    Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.  We will have until 12     
    months from the closing of this offering to consummate our initial business  
    combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate 
    our initial business combination within 12 months, we may extend the period  
    of time to consummate a business combination up to three times, each by an   
    additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a        
    business combination). In order to extend the time available for us to       
    consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates
    or designees must deposit into the trust account approximately $292,000, or     
    approximately $335,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is         
    exercised in full ($0.0583 per unit in either case), on or prior to the date 
    of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension, up to an         
    aggregate of approximately $875,000 (or $1,000,000 if the underwriters’      
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) if extended three times, or      
    $0.1750 per unit.                                                            

(6) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in 
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust     
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect     
    approximately $425,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the     
    funds held in the trust account over 21 months following the closing of this 
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This  
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.85% per annum based upon current      
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.             

(7) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
    financing.                                                                   

(8) Reflects payment of $10,000 per month for up to 12 months.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement units, $50,750,000 (or approximately $58,362,500 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to $1,750,000 (or up
to $2,012,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will initially be placed in a trust
account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee,
subject to increase in the event that our sponsor elects to extend the period of
time to consummate a business combination, and will be invested only in U.S.
government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$425,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.85% per year. We will not be
permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust
account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or up to a maximum
of $600,000 of working capital expenses (which may include repayment of loans
made to us by the sponsor or the application of withdrawn or accrued interest to
the sponsor’s obligation to loan us money in connection with an extension),
until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination or
(ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a
business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering (or up
to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of time
to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this
prospectus) (subject to the requirements of law). Depending on interest rates,
interest earned on the trust account may not be sufficient to pay taxes or a
substantial portion of working capital expenses.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our executive officers a total of $10,000 per month for
office space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 in the aggregate to be used for a portion of the expenses of this
offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of December 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. These loans will
be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $460,000 of offering
proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account including interest permitted to be withdrawn as
described herein. In the event that our initial business combination does not
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
account including interest permitted to be withdrawn as described herein to
repay such loaned amounts but no other proceeds from our trust account would be
used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans (including any
loans made in connection with the extension of the time available for us to
consummate our initial business combination) may be convertible into units of
the post-business combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option
of the lender (which, for example, if $1,500,000 of loans were so converted,
would result in the holders being issued (a) 165,000 shares of common stock,
consisting of (i) 150,000 shares underlying the units and (ii) 15,000 shares to
be issued upon the closing of our business combination pursuant to the 150,000
rights included in such units, as well as (b) 150,000 warrants). The units would
be identical to the private placement units. All other terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our business
combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and
the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition
that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public
stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net
tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not
proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of this
offering (or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the
period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail
in this prospectus), following the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations (including
but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed
business combination or (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection
with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an
initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering
(or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of
time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this
prospectus), from the closing of our initial public offering. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares, private placement shares and public shares in connection with
the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial
stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to their founder shares and private placement
shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed
time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or
affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of
    loans from our sponsors of an aggregate of $250,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the 
    completion of our initial business combination, $12,250,000, which 
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $14,087,500 if the 
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to 
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining 
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or 
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest 
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a 
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional 
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special 
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) The amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from
    the trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested 
    only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or
    less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 
    under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
    treasury obligations. We estimate the after-tax interest earned on the trust
    account will be approximately $875,000 per year, assuming an interest rate 
    of 0.5% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this 
    amount.

Of the $358.75 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $412.3 million
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $350.0 million
($10.00 per unit), or $402.5 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $8.75
million, or $9.80 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing
of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The proceeds
held in the trust account may be invested only in U.S. government treasury
obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate the after-tax
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $875,000 per year,
assuming an interest rate of 0.5% per year; however, we can provide no
assurances regarding this amount. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of
the principal or interest held in the trust account, except for (i) the
withdrawal of interest to pay our income taxes, if any, and (ii) interest for
our working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of $750,000, until
the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly
submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect
the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if
we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from
the closing of this offering. Based on current interest rates, we expect that
interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation
of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, in addition to the interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us as described
above, will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds
are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin
preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication
of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the
circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that
addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
our sponsors, members of our management team or any of their affiliates, but
such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse our sponsors for office space, secretarial and administrative
services provided to members of our management team, in an amount not to exceed
$20,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the date of this prospectus, our sponsors have loaned us $250,000 to be
used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 1, 2018 or
the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the funds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsors, officers or directors or
their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required
on an interest-free basis. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account
released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held
outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the
trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity
at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our
initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsors, officers or directors or their affiliates as we do not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account."

stock in this offering will be approximately $35.3 million, based upon the
initial public offering price of $5.50 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares
in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to be received by us will be
approximately $40.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and thereby
enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. We
intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to repay the 2017 GHP
Convertible Notes, to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our Loan
Agreement of approximately $7.0 million (including prepayment premiums), fund
future acquisitions of individual yoga studios or businesses with multiple
studios, investments or capital expenditures and for working capital and other
general corporate purposes. Although we have no binding obligations to enter
into any acquisitions, we have entered into letters of intent or are in
late-state negotiations to acquire up to 20 additional studios for an aggregate
purchase price in cash between $7.8 million and $9.4 million, including earnout
payments.

In March 2017, we issued the 2017 GHP Convertible Notes to Great Hill Partners
in the aggregate principal amount of $3.2 million, with an annual interest rate
of 8% and with a maturity date of March 27, 2018. We issued the 2017 GHP
Convertible Notes to ensure we had adequate working capital available to finance
the incremental costs to be incurred in connection with this offering and
becoming a public company. We intend to use $3.3 million of our net proceeds
from this offering to repay outstanding amounts under the 2017 GHP Convertible
Notes upon the consummation of this offering.

The maturity date of the Loan Agreement is in July 2020. Borrowings under the
Loan Agreement currently carry an annual interest rate of LIBOR rate plus 8.00%,
with a decrease to LIBOR plus 7.50% upon the consummation of our initial public
offering if our initial public offering is consummated on or prior to December
31, 2017 and results in aggregate cash proceeds of at least $25.0 million. Upon
the first fiscal quarter we are in compliance with our Loan Agreement’s
financial ratio covenants, starting with the fiscal quarter ending March 31,
2018, and so long as there is no default or potential event of default under the
Loan Agreement, the applicable interest rate on our loans under the Loan
Agreement would be LIBOR plus 7.00%. We intend to use $7.0 million of our net
proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding balance under the Loan
Agreement (including any prepayment premiums) and cancel the Loan Agreement upon
the consummation of this offering.

We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this
offering and investors will be relying on the judgement of our management
regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the
use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to invest the net
proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term and long-term
interest-bearing obligations, including debt securities and money market funds."

option to purchase additional ADSs in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to
us from this offering will be approximately $78.8 million after deducting the
underwriting commission and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash resources, for the following purposes:

• approximately $45 million to fund clinical trials and registration of

intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. As of the date

discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we        
    received as loans from our insiders described below. These funds will be     
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.
                 
(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the 
    private units.                                                               

(3) The deferred underwriting discounts and commissions in an amount of 2.5% of  
    the gross proceeds raised in this offering will be payable to the            
    underwriters upon the consummation of our initial business combination and   
    will be held in the trust account until the consummation of such initial     
    business combination.                                                        

(4) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our    
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including  
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to Chardan Capital   
    Markets, LLC in an amount equal to 2.5% of the total gross proceeds raised 
    in the offering described below.                                                

(5) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at 
    approximately $700,000 even if the over-allotment option is exercised.       

(6) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business 
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our 
    intended use of proceeds.     

Wai Fun Cheng, Ren Hua Zheng and Ying Chen and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC have
committed that they will purchase the private units (for an aggregate purchase
price of $3,200,000) from us on a private placement basis that will occur
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. They have also agreed
that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in
part, they (and/or their designees) will purchase from us at a price of $10.00
per unit the number of private units (up to a maximum of 30,000 private units)
that is necessary to maintain in the trust account an amount equal to $10.20 per
share of common stock sold to the public in this offering. All of the proceeds
we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.

$40,800,000, or $46,920,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase., maintained
by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee. The funds held in
the trust account will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations,
the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption of 100% of
the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in
the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our
initial business combination to the extent not used to pay converting
stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s fees, consulting fees or other
similar compensation) will be paid to our insiders, members of our management
team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine
their operations. Since the role of present management after our initial
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $700,000. We intend to use such funds for miscellaneous expenses
such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the
balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our insiders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to Chardan Capital
Markets, LLC in an amount equal to 2.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in
the offering upon consummation of our initial business combination. To the
extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to
effect our initial business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account
which are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such
working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or
expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for
marketing, research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Wai Fun Cheng, Ren Hua Zheng, Richard Xu and Tom
W. Su have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation
(currently anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek
repayment of such expenses.

As of May 31, 2017, Ren Hua Zheng, our director, loaned us $175,000 to repay the
then outstanding $175,000 loan, which had been used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses. This
resulted in our having actual liabilities of $350,000 as of May 31, 2017. The
prior note was repaid on June 1, 2017. The loans are payable without interest on
the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for up to the next 18 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our insiders, officers and directors (and/or their designees)
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the
private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to
so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business
combination. If we do not complete a business combination, any loans and
advances from our insiders, officers and directors or their affiliates, will be
repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust account, if any.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any
tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

approximately US$27.25 million, in the event of maximum offering after deducting
underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. These
estimates are based upon an assumed initial public offering price of US$10.00
per ordinary share. A US$1.00 increase in the assumed initial public offering
price of US$11.00 per ordinary share would increase the net proceeds to us from
this offering by US$3,000,000, assuming the number of ordinary shares offered by
us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and
after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated expenses payable by us.

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes,
which may include investment in product development, sales and marketing
activities, acquisition of other companies, technology infrastructure, team
development, capital expenditures, improvement of corporate facilities and other
general and administrative matters. Specifically, we plan to use approximately
10 % of the net proceeds to increase our working capital. In addition, we plan
to use about 50% of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses that
complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements
to enter into any acquisitions or investments. We may also use about 15% of the
net proceeds to develop our online financial service practice. We also plan to
spend 15% of the net proceeds on marketing our business. We plan to use the rest
(10%) of the net proceeds for improvement of our internal control system and
other general and administrative matters. The foregoing represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions to use and
allocate the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement.
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus.  

The table below sets forth the amount of the proceeds that will be allocated for
each purpose under each of the minimum and maximum scenarios.

If we were to raise an amount between the minimum and maximum offerings, the
percentage of net proceeds allocated for each use as described above will remain
unchanged. 

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary in China only through loans or capital contributions
and to our consolidated variable interest entity only through loans, subject to
the filings with government authorities and limit on the amount of capital
contributions and loans. Subject to completion of applicable government filing
and registration requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary in China or make additional capital contributions to
our wholly-foreign-owned subsidiary to fund its capital expenditures or working
capital. For an increase of registered capital of our wholly foreign-owned
subsidiary, we need to complete a filing with the MOFCOM or its local
counterparts. If we provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary
through loans, the total amount of such loans may not exceed the difference
between the entity’s total investment as approved by the foreign investment
authorities and its registered capital. Such loans must be registered with SAFE
or its local branches, which usually takes up to 20 working days to complete. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations
or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

approximately $109.1 million based upon the initial public offering price of
$15.00 per common share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’
over-allotment option to purchase additional shares in this offering is
exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately 
$125.8 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our common shares, and
facilitate our access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we will
use the net proceeds of this offering, together with our existing cash on hand,
as follows:

• Approximately $65.0 million to fund expenses incurred in pursuing the        
  registration of palovarotene in FOP, including conducting the Phase 3 MOVE   
  clinical trial and additional clinical trials of palovarotene for the 
  treatment of FOP;                                                            

• Approximately $25.0 million to fund expenses incurred in conducting the Phase
  2/3 clinical trial of palovarotene for the treatment of MO;                  

• Approximately $10.0 million to fund expenses incurred in conducting the Phase
  1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of palovarotene for the treatment of dry eye   
  disease; and

  pre-commercial activities, research and development expenses, and other 
  general corporate purposes.                                                  

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary
technologies, products or assets. The amounts and timing of our actual use of
net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors, including the status of
and results from clinical trials, the timing of regulatory submissions, and the
progress of our development and commercialization efforts. As a result, our
management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Pending its use, we intend to invest the net proceeds to us from the offering in
accordance with the terms of our investment policy, as approved by our board of
directors, or hold them as cash."

our common stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses payable by us, will be approximately $481.2
million (or approximately $554.1 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to redeem approximately
$446.2 million (or approximately $512.7 million if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional shares in full) in aggregate principal
amount of PQ Corporation’s Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 (the
“Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes”), together with accrued and unpaid
interest, and applicable redemption premiums. As of June 30, 2017, there was
$525.0 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Unsecured
Notes outstanding and approximately $0.4 million of accrued and unpaid interest.
The Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes bear interest at an annual rate equal
to the three-month LIBOR plus 10.75%, with a 1% LIBOR floor, and mature on May
1, 2022, provided that if PQ Corporation’s 8.5% Senior Notes due 2022 have been
refinanced or otherwise repaid prior to such date, the Floating Rate Senior
Unsecured Notes will instead mature on May 1, 2023. Up to 50% of the Floating
Rate Senior Unsecured Notes may be redeemed at a price equal to 106% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest using the net proceeds
from this offering and we have agreed with the noteholders of the Floating Rate
Senior Unsecured Notes to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem additional
Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes at a price equal to 109% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We estimate that the
redemption of approximately $446.2 million (or approximately $512.7 million if
the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) in
aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes will decrease
our annual interest expense by approximately $53.9 million (or $61.9 million if
the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full)
and our annual weighted average cost of debt to 5.7% (or 5.5% if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full)."

common stock offered by us will be approximately $114.8 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $17.00 per share and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares in this
offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds from this
offering will be approximately $132.6 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of June 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $94.0 million. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $60 million to fund clinical trials for DCC-2618, including the
  dose escalation and expansion stages of our current Phase 1 clinical trial and
  additional clinical trials, including a pivotal clinical trial in fourth-line
  GIST, as well as clinical research outsourcing and manufacturing of clinical
  trial material;

• approximately $6 million to fund clinical trials for DCC-3014, including the
  dose escalation stage of our Phase 1 clinical trial, as well as clinical
  research outsourcing and manufacturing of clinical trial material;

• approximately $6 million to fund clinical trials for rebastinib, as well as
  clinical research outsourcing and manufacturing of clinical trial material;
 
• pproximately $10 million to fund the new and ongoing research activities or
  ture drug candidates using our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor
  platform; and

• the remainder for working capital purposes, including general operating
  expenses.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and other development
efforts for DCC-2618 and other factors, as well as the amount of cash we use in
our operations. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we
might decide to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or preclinical activities
if the net proceeds from this offering and the other sources of cash are less
than expected.

The expected net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash
and cash equivalents, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our drug
candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional
capital to complete the development and commercialization of our drug
candidates. We expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity
offerings, debt financings and potential collaborations, license and development
agreements. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be
incorrect, and we could expend our available capital resources at a rate greater
than we currently expect.

Pending application of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds
from this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

of approximately $90.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
to us from this offering will be approximately $104.7 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering, together with
our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $38.0 to $50.0 million to further the development of Acelarin,
  including (i) completing an ongoing Phase 2 trial, completing a planned Phase
  2 trial in combination with Avastin, and initiating a planned Phase 3 trial in
  combination with carboplatin, each in patients with ovarian cancer, (ii)
  completing an ongoing Phase 1b trial in combination with cisplatin and
  initiating a planned Phase 3 trial in combination with cisplatin, each in
  patients with biliary cancer, and (iii) funding the ongoing Phase III trial in
  pancreatic cancer that is being facilitated by The National Cancer Research
  Institute in the United Kingdom;              

• approximately $28.0 to $35.0 million to further the development of NUC-3373, 
  including (i) completing a Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid
  tumors, (ii) completing a Phase 1b trial and initiating a Phase 3 trial, each
  in patients with colorectal cancer, and (iii) completing a Phase 2 trial in
  patients with breast cancer;                 

• approximately $3.0 to $4.0 million to further the development of NUC-7738, 
  including completing a Phase 1 trial in patients with solid tumors and a Phase
  1 trial in patients with hematological malignancies; and             

• the remaining proceeds to fund other research and development activities,

  expenses of being a public company.                                        

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from
clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties
for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. Moreover, our
estimates of the costs to fund our trials are based on the current designs of
the trials. If we were to modify the design of any of these trials, for
instance, to increase the number of patients in the trials, our costs to fund
the trials could increase. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at
least through the first quarter of 2020. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available
capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending specific utilization of the net proceeds as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short- and intermediate-term
interest-bearing obligations and certificates of deposit."

offering will be $66.5 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, based on the initial
public offering price of $14.00 per ADS. If the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional ADSs in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to
us from this offering will be $76.9 million, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, to advance our clinical pipeline, including
specifically:

. approximately $24.0 million to fund the clinical development of NSR-REP1 for
  the treatment of CHM, including the initiation and completion of our planned
  Phase 3 clinical trial of NSR-REP1 for the treatment of CHM;

. approximately $19.0 million to fund the clinical development of NSR-RPGR for
  XLRP, including the completion of our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of
  NSR-RPGR for the treatment of XLRP;

. approximately $12.0 million to fund the preclinical and early clinical 
  development of NSR-BEST1 for the treatment of Best disease, including the
  initiation and partial conduct of a planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial; and

. the remainder to fund other research and development activities, working 
  capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire,
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.
However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

Even with the expected net proceeds from this offering, we will need to raise
additional capital to complete the clinical development of NSR-RPGR, including
any potential Phase 3 clinical trial of NSR-RPGR, and to complete the clinical
development of NSR-BEST1. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors, including the status and results of our ongoing
and planned clinical trials, the design of our clinical trials, the pace of
patient enrollment, the occurrence of adverse events, feedback from regulatory
agencies, the timing of approval of any of our product candidates, any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates and any unforeseen cash needs.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Predicting the cost
necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult and the amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we
might decide to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or preclinical activities

offering will be approximately $136.2 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with the cash
generated by our operations and other cash resources, primarily to further
advance the clinical development and commercial launch of our multiple drug
candidates. In particular, we currently expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering as follows:

• approximately $38.0 million to complete (i) Phase III studies of niraparib
  (ZL-2306) in patients with ovarian, breast cancer and other indications in
  China, (ii) Phase III studies of omadacycline (ZL-2401) in China and (iii)
  Phase II/III studies of ZL-2301 in patients with HCC in China;

• approximately $20.0 million to support the commercialization efforts for
  niraparib (ZL-2306) in China, Hong Kong and Macau;             

• approximately $40.0 million to fund new business development and licensing
  opportunities and to accelerate and broaden clinical development of our drug
  candidates for which we have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize
  globally;                                              

• approximately $15.0 million for research and clinical development of other
  drug candidates; and                                               

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which we could change in
our discretion in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Due to
the many variables inherent to the development of our drug candidates at this
time, such as the timing of patient enrollment and evolving regulatory
requirements, we cannot currently predict the stage of development we expect to
achieve for our pre-clinical and clinical trial and drug candidates with the net
proceeds of this offering. We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds
for working capital and other general corporate purposes, such as acquiring the
commercial rights to other drug products and expanding our research organization
and infrastructure. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the results of the
pre-clinical and clinical trial of our drug candidates, our operating costs and
expenditures and the amount of cash generated by our operations. As a result,
our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade,
short-term fixed income instruments."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    borrowed from our sponsor described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    founders’ units.

(3) Of the proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the founders’
    units described in this prospectus, $50,000,000, or $57,500,000 if the
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit),
    will initially be deposited into a trust account with Continental Stock
    Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. We will have until 12 months
    from the closing of this offering to consummate an initial business
    combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate
    our initial business combination within 12 months, we may extend the period
    of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an
    additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a
    business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated
    certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into
    between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of
    this prospectus, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate
    our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or
    designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline,
    must deposit into the trust account $500,000, or up to $575,000 if the
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.10 per share in
    either case) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each
    three month extension (or up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 (or up to
    $1,150,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full),
    or $0.20 per share, if we extend for the full six months).

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at
    approximately $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. Does not
    include interest earned on the trust proceeds that may be available to us.

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) have committed to
purchase from us an aggregate of 250,000 founders’ units at $10.00 per unit (for
a total purchase price of $2,500,000), among which 200,000 sponsor units will be
purchased by our sponsor and 50,000 EBC units will be purchased by
EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees), in a private placement that will close
simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our sponsor and
EarlyBirdCapital have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised
by the underwriters in full or in part, they will purchase from us additional
founders’ units (up to a maximum of 22,500 founders’ units, among which 18,000
sponsor units will be purchased by our sponsor and 4,500 EBC units will be
purchased by EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees)) at a price of $10.00 per
founders’ unit in order in order to maintain in the trust account $10.00 per
unit sold to the public in this offering. These additional founders’ units will
be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the
purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The
founders’ units are identical to the units sold in this offering, subject to
certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the
proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account
described below.

$50,000,000, or $57,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the founders’ units will be
placed in a U.S. — based trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States “government
securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the
conditions of paragraph (d) under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our redemption of 100% of
the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in
the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to our sponsor of a monthly fee of an aggregate of $10,000 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our
benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated officers and
directors with compensation in lieu of a salary. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the
trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee
and the repayment of loans from our sponsor (none of which payments will be made
from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the
completion of our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind
will be paid to our sponsor, officers, directors or any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, such entity and individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Our
audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to
our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any
interested director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit
on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to
the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate
an initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants or advisors to assist us with our search for a target
business, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsor, officers and directors in
connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole
or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held
in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination
(including to pay converting stockholders as described herein) will be disbursed
to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not
expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account
and any available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we
are permitted to withdraw.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced us an aggregate of
$244,238 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee,
the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The advances will be payable without interest on
the consummation of this offering. The advances will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 12 months (or up to 18 months if we
extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full
amount of time), assuming that a business combination is not consummated during
that time. However, if necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs
following the consummation of this offering, our sponsor, officers and directors
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at
holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into units
at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders
being issued 165,000 shares of Class A common stock if $1,500,000 of notes were
so converted since the 150,000 rights included in such units would result in the
issuance of 15,000 shares upon the closing of our business combination, as well
as 75,000 warrants to purchase 75,000 shares). The units would be identical to
the founders’ units. If we do not complete a business combination, the loans
will be forgiven.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer,
in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek
to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would stop our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares
to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete a business combination within 12 months from the closing of this
offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the
period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time).
This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such
amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, whether
proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or
any other person. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of   
    June 30, 2017, we had borrowed $100,000 under the promissory note with our  
    sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.          
    Subsequent to June 30, 2017, we have not borrowed any other amount under the
    promissory note. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering
    out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the  
    payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held 
    in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as  
    set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing 
    working capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more
    than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held
    in the trust account.                                    

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, $21,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters’      
    deferred commissions (or up to $24,150,000 if the underwriters’             
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be   
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination   
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business   
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working        
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on   
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.                        

(4) Amount shown as underwriting commission includes the fee payable to 
    Connaught at the closing of this offering. For financial advisory services  
    provided by Connaught in connection with this offering, we have agreed to   
    pay Connaught a fee in an amount equal to 10% of the underwriting commission
    payable to the underwriters. The fee to Connaught will be paid in part at   
    the closing of this offering and in part at the closing of the initial      
    business combination, in the same proportion as the non-deferred and        
    deferred commission payable to the underwriters. The underwriters have      
    agreed to reimburse us for the fee to Connaught as it becomes payable out of
    the underwriting commission.                                                

(5) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts 
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed         
    estimates.                                                                  

(6) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately     
    $3,000,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in  
    the trust account over the 12 months following the closing of this offering;
    however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate  
    assumes an interest rate of 0.5% per annum based upon current yields of     
    securities in which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order
    to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
    combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our   
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may  
    be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the    
    trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not  
    close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust   
    account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account 
    would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans  
    may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the     
    option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private        
    placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any,  
    have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to    
    such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our      
    sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties   
    will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all 
    rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.                        

(7) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment   
    fees for financing.                                                         

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $600,000,000 (or $690,000,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $21,000,000 (or up to
$24,150,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering,
be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The funds in the 
trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a 
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. 
Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment 
Company Act. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest 
earned on the trust account will be approximately $3,000,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 0.5% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of 
the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of
interest to pay taxes, if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be 
released from the trust account until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our
initial business combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly 
tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance and timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering; and (3)
the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our 
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering,
subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we expect that 
interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to loan funds
to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of June
30, 2017, we had borrowed $100,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor to
be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. Subsequent to June 30,
2017, we have not borrowed any other amount under the promissory note. These
loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December
31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon
completion of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has
been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting
commissions) not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of 
such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at 
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private 
placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have
not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an 
affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to 
loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access
to funds in our trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any such 
transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder 
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial 
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans 
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, 
they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any 
material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases
are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently 
anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject
to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the 
purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are 
subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny
stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require
as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of
cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that
we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business
combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering; and (3) the
redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination. Our directors and officers have
entered into letter agreements similar to the one signed by our initial
shareholders with respect to public shares acquired by them, if any. In
addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."
TREMONT MORTGAGE TRUST,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tremont-mortgage-trust-1027604-84148,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tremont-mortgage-trust-1027604-84148,424B4,9/15/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12282016,"We are offering 2,500,000 Shares at the initial public offering price of $20.00
per Share. Our Manager will pay all of the initial organizational costs related
to our formation and the costs of this Offering, including underwriting
discounts and commissions of $1.25 per Share. As a result, all Shares will be
purchased by the underwriters from us at $20.00 per Share, and the proceeds we
will receive from selling Shares in this Offering will be $50.0 million
($57.5 million if the underwriters' overallotment option is exercised in full).
We will also receive additional proceeds of $12.0 million from our sale of
Shares to our Manager in the concurrent private placement.

We plan to use all the proceeds of this Offering and the concurrent private
placement of Shares to our Manager to make investments in accordance with our
objectives and strategies described in this prospectus. Although we expect our
primary focus will be originating and investing in floating rate first mortgage
loans of less than $50.0 million, our target investments will also include
subordinated mortgages, mezzanine loans, or preferred equity interests in
entities that own middle market and transitional CRE. From time to time, we may
also invest in other CRE related investments, including CMBS. We have not yet
identified any specific investments. Until appropriate investments are
identified, we expect to invest the proceeds of this Offering and the concurrent
private placement in interest or dividend paying, short term investments that
are consistent with our intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT and maintain
our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. These
investments are expected to provide lower earnings than we expect to achieve
from our target investments. Prior to the time we have fully used the proceeds
of this Offering and the concurrent private placement to make investments in our
target investments, we may fund some or all of our quarterly distributions out
of the proceeds of this Offering. Also, even after we have invested the proceeds
of this Offering and the concurrent private placement, if our earnings are
insufficient to fund our distributions to shareholders at the level established
by our Board of Trustees, we may pay distributions to our shareholders with the
proceeds of borrowings or other leverage that we may establish or from sales of
our assets."

by us, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $3,913,121 from this
offering if the minimum offering is sold and approximately $6,238,121 if the

to China before we will be able to use the funds to grow our business. The
procedure to remit funds may take several months after completion of this
offering, and we will be unable to use the funds in China until remittance is
completed. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows after we complete
the remittance process, and we have ordered the specific uses of proceeds in
order of priority. We do not expect that our priorities for fund allocation
would change if the amount we raise in this offering exceeds the size of the
minimum offering but is less than the maximum offering. We expect to devote any
funds raised over the minimum offering amount to our working capital needs,
including devoting further resources to the below uses of proceeds.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. We cannot predict
whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return. Our management will
have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive from
this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the net proceeds. These investments may have a
material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an
investment in our Ordinary Shares. It is possible that we may become a passive
foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers, which could result
in negative tax consequences to you.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary in China only through loans or capital contributions
and to our consolidated variable interest entity only through loans, subject to
the filings with government authorities and limit on the amount of capital
contributions and loans. Subject to completion of applicable government filing
and registration requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary in China or make additional capital contributions to
our wholly-foreign-owned subsidiary to fund its capital expenditures or working
capital. If we provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary through
loans, the total amount of such loans may not exceed the difference between the
entity’s total investment as approved by the foreign investment authorities and
its registered capital. Such loans must be registered with SAFE or its local
branches, which usually takes up to 20 working days to complete. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $104.5 million, based upon
the initial public offering price of $22.00 per share and after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of our
common stock from us is exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to
us would be approximately $120.7 million, after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The
principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our stock, thereby enabling
access to the public equity markets by our employees and stockholders, obtain
additional capital, and increase our visibility in the marketplace. We intend to
use the net proceeds received from this offering primarily for general corporate
purposes, including headcount expansion, working capital, sales and marketing
activities, product development, general and administrative matters, and capital
expenditures. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to fully repay our term
loan under our credit facility (including related prepayment penalties, accrued
interest, and related fee payments). The term loan, which we entered into for
working capital purposes, has an interest rate of 3.25%, matures on December 1,
2020, and had an outstanding balance of $26.3 million as of June 30, 2017.
Concurrent with the final payment of our term loan, we will be required to make
an additional payment of $825,000 under our credit facility. We may also use a
portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,
technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business, although we
have no present commitments to complete any such transactions at this time. Our
expected uses of the net proceeds from this offering represent our intentions
based on our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for such proceeds or the amounts that we
actually will spend on the uses specified above. Accordingly, our management
will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering.
The timing and amount of our actual application of the net proceeds from this
offering will be based on many factors, including our cash flows from operations
and the actual and anticipated growth of our business. We will have broad
discretion over the uses of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending these
uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts,
certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

We intend to contribute $86.4 million of the net proceeds that we receive from
this offering to Merchants Bank to support balance sheet growth, and to use the
remainder for general corporate purposes, which could include future 
acquisitions and other growth initiatives. We also intend to use approximately
$5.8 million to complete the pending acquisition of Joy State Bank. We do not 
have any current specific plan for such remaining net proceeds, and do not have
any current plans, arrangements or understandings to make any material 
acquisitions or to establish any de novo bank branches. Our management will

sale of common shares, based on the initial public offering price of US$16.00
per common share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
expenses payable by us.

The net proceeds to the selling shareholder (after deducting underwriting fees)
are expected to be approximately US$159.6 million (or US$230.3 million if the
underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option), at the initial public
offering price of US$16.00 per common share. We will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of common shares by the selling shareholder.

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from the offering primarily to
provide additional funding to advance the development of our main near-term
growth projects during 2018 and 2019. In particular, we intend to use:

• Approximately US$210 million of the net proceeds to advance the development of
  our Aripuanã greenfield project in Brazil, of which we intend to use US$59
  million in 2018 and US$151 million in 2019. The following table presents a

• Approximately US$23 million of the net proceeds in 2018 to convert our
  Cajamarquilla smelter to the Jarosite process in order to improve this
  smelter's zinc recovery rate.

We intend to fund the shortfall from the use of proceeds described above from
our general cash resources. The offering will also create a public market for
our common shares and thereby facilitate our future access to the capital
markets.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use of the 
net proceeds of this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will
depend on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive 
developments, our rate of growth and inorganic growth opportunities. Pending
application of the proceeds, we will invest the funds in bank deposits and
financial instruments in accordance with our general practices for treasury
management."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we   
    borrowed from our sponsor, Shareholder Value Fund described below. These 
    funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. 
    If we determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would not be
    repaid.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.    

(3) The funds held in the trust account will be used to acquire a target  
    business, to pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares for a
    portion of the funds held in the trust account and potentially to pay our
    expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to the representative of
    the underwriters equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering
    upon consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in
    connection with our initial business combination. Our expenses relating to
    the acquisition of a target business would either come from the funds held
    in the trust account or additional funds otherwise available to us outside
    of the trust account, including cash held by the target business. Any 
    remaining funds will be disbursed to the combined company and be used as 
    working capital to finance the operations of the target business. 

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $500,000 
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.   

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than      
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which     
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.   

Our sponsor has agreed to purchase an aggregate of 475,000 private units at a
price of $10.00 per private unit ($4,750,000 in the aggregate) in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. It
has further agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the
underwriters, it will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per private unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 54,000 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least
$10.00 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless
of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These
additional private units will be purchased in a private placement that will
occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of
the over-allotment option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account described below.

$180,000,000, or $207,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at JPMorgan Chase Bank in the United States, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Pursuant to the investment management trust agreement that will govern the
investment of such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will
direct JPMorgan Chase Bank to invest the funds as set forth in such written
instructions and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise
instructed in accordance with the investment management trust agreement. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or
other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or
any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto. If the
payment of our liabilities, including the fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal
to 3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any
applicable finders’ fees which might become payable), were to reduce the amount
available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or
sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we
would not be able to consummate such transaction. To the extent that our share
capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to
consummate a business combination, to pay holders who wish to convert their
shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses
relating thereto (which could include the up to $7,245,000 payable to
EarlyBirdCapital described above if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full) will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other
net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations
of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of
ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for
strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing
or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Shareholder Value Fund, our
sponsor, has agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such
liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than $18,500) and has agreed
not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of July 17, 2017, our sponsor had loaned to us an aggregate of $300,000 to be
used to pay formation and a portion of the expenses of this offering. On
September 1, 2017, our sponsor loaned to us an additional $200,000. The loans
are payable without interest on the date on which we consummate our initial
public offering. If we determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts
would not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into private units at a price of
$10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued
units to acquire 55,000 ordinary shares (which includes 5,000 shares issuable
upon conversion of rights) and warrants to purchase 25,000 ordinary shares if
$500,000 of notes were so converted). If we do not complete our initial business
combination, the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination
within the required time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such
public shares or sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection
with a business combination which we consummate or in connection with an
amendment to our memorandum and articles of association prior to the
consummation of an initial business combination. In no other circumstances will
a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account."

$182.3 (€154.9) million, based on a public offering price of $17.50 per ADS,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us, and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional ADSs. If the underwriters exercise in full their options to
purchase additional ADSs, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the
offering of approximately $210.2 (€178.6) million, based on a public offering
price of $17.50 per ADS, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of the offering are to increase our financial flexibility
to prepare for the commercialization of caplacizumab, if approved, advance our
clinical pipeline, create a public market for our securities in the United
States and facilitate our access to the U.S. public equity markets. We currently
expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $55.3 million to continue to build-out a sales, marketing and 
  distribution infrastructure in preparation for the commercial launch of
  caplacizumab in Europe and the United States; 

• approximately $101.3 million to advance the development of ALX-0171 through 
  its Phase II trials; and 

• approximately $25.7 million to advance the discovery and development of 
  earlier stage products. 

We expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from the offering for working
capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the
net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary technologies,
products or assets, either alone or together with a collaboration partner.
However we have no current plan, commitments or obligations to do so.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. We cannot
predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be
received upon the closing of the offering or the amounts that we will actually
spend on the uses set forth above. Predicting the costs necessary to develop
Nanobody candidates can be difficult. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures and the extent of clinical development may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including the progress, timing and completion of
our development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical studies and
any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future,
the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approval for our product
candidates as well as maintaining our existing collaborations and any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from the
offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of the offering and our current
cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets, we estimate that such funds
will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months. We have based this
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations and certificates of
deposit."

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $300,000,000 (or $345,000,000
    if the underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised in full) as well as
    amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in
    connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    June 15, 2017, we had borrowed $175,000 (of up to $300,000 available to us)
    under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the
    expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon completion of
    this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting
    commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than as set forth
    in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the $1,250,000 of
    offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside for post-
    closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering expenses are
    less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for
    post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. If the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised, 5.5% of the gross proceeds from the over-allotment
    ($0.55 per unit or up to $2,475,000 in the aggregate) will be deposited in
    the trust account as deferred underwriting commissions. Upon completion of
    our initial business combination, $10,500,000, which constitutes the
    underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $12,975,000 if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, less amounts released to us to pay
    redeeming shareholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or
    a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes,
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled
    to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $10,500,000 (or $12,975,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $2,820,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.94% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise
and income tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the
private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the
redemption of our public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to amend
any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating
to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii)
the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering
(subject to the requirements of law).

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of June
15, 2017, we had borrowed $175,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor to
be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2017
or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the offering proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds on a non-interest basis as may be required. If we complete our
initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the
proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be
repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up
to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of
$1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical
to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price,
exercisability and exercise period. We do not expect to seek loans from parties
other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. No written agreements
exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ. However, they have no
current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have
not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. One purpose
and effect of any such transactions would be to seek to obtain the necessary
number of votes in favor of our initial business combination, as our sponsor,
directors and officers have agreed, pursuant to the letter agreement, to vote
any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after
this offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions)
in favor of our initial business combination. If they engage in such
transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession
of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such
purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going- private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described in this prospectus, (ii) the redemption of our public shares in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or
pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described in this prospectus and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval
in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in
connection with the business combination alone will not result in a
stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the
trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights
described above.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated
offering expenses payable by us and based upon an assumed initial public
offering price of US$6 per Ordinary Share, of approximately $5,485,000 if we
sell the minimum number of Ordinary Shares and approximately $9,205,000 if we
sell the maximum number of Ordinary Shares. Assuming the number of Ordinary
Shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains
the same, and after deduction of the estimated commissions to the underwriter
and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, a US$1.00 increase (decrease)
in the assumed initial public offering price of US$6.00 per Ordinary Share would
increase (decrease) the net proceeds of this offering by approximately US$1.0
million if the minimum offering amount is sold, or approximately US$1.5 million
if the maximum offering amount is sold.

    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
    combination.                                                                 

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans   
    from our sponsors of up to an aggregate of $300,000 as described in this     
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out  
    of the $900,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the
    trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.                                                                     

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial       
    business combination, $10,500,000, which constitutes the underwriters’       
    deferred commissions (or up to $12,075,000 if the underwriters’              
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters 
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be    
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price 
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination    
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or  
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business    
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.  

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in 
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust     
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect the trust account  
    to generate approximately $1,500,000 of interest annually following the      
    investment of such funds in specified U.S. Government Treasury bills or in   
    specified money market funds beginning in January 2018; however, we can      
    provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an        
    interest rate of 0.5% per annum based upon current yields of securities in   
    which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance    
    transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business            
    combination, our sponsors or affiliates of our sponsors or certain of our    
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be
    required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay    
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. 
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the     
    trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not   
    close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust    
    account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account  
    would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans   
    may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a
    price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
    be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsors. The
    terms of such loans by our sponsors, affiliates of our sponsors, or certain
    of our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no
    written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to
    seek loans from parties other than our sponsors or affiliates of our
    sponsors as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
    funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to
    funds in our trust account.  

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment    
    fees for financing.                                                          

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
$300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including $10,500,000 (or up to $12,075,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering, be
placed in a non-interest bearing U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.
Beginning in January 2018, the funds in the trust account will be invested only
in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $1,500,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 0.5% per year, following the investment of such funds in
specified U.S. government treasury bills or in specified money market funds
beginning in January 2018. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the
principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of
interest to fund our working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of
$750,000, and/or to pay our taxes, if any, the proceeds from this offering and
the sale of the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust
account until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association to modify the substance and timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months, as
applicable) and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering (or 27 months, as applicable), subject to applicable
law. Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the
trust account will be sufficient to pay our taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsors, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Agreement with an affiliate of Mosaic Sponsor, LLC,
pursuant to which we will pay such affiliate a total of $16,875 per month for
office space and related support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Starting upon the closing of this offering, we will pay a monthly retainer of
$5,000 for our Chief Financial Officer. We will also make a deferred cash
payment to him upon completion of our initial business combination or
liquidation, whichever occurs first. Additionally, we will issue Class A
ordinary shares to him upon completion of our initial business combination. This
deferred cash payment and the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued
will be based on an hourly rate for his services and the actual hours of service
performed. Any deferred cash payment will not be claimed against the trust
account.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsors have agreed to loan us an
aggregate of up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses related to
the organization of our company and this offering. This loan is non-interest
bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of March 31, 2018 or the closing of
this offering. This loan will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of
the $900,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of
offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsors or affiliates of our
sponsors or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsors. The
terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements
exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties
other than our sponsors or affiliates of our sponsors as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. However, such persons have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny
stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require
as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of
cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that
we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months
from the closing of this offering if we have executed a letter of intent,
agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering but have not
completed the initial business combination within such 24-month period) (iii)
the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering
(or 27 months, as applicable), subject to applicable law. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any
founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder
shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsors or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame.

Prior to this offering, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to
which the anchor investors (including an affiliate of Fortress Mosaic Sponsor
LLC) have agreed to purchase the forward purchase shares in a private placement
to occur concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination.

In connection with the forward purchase shares sold to the anchor investors, the
sponsors will receive (by way of an adjustment to their existing Class F Shares)
an aggregate number of additional Class F Shares equal to one ninth of the
aggregate number of forward purchase shares sold to the anchor investors.

If the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares is less than
$11.00 (as adjusted for share splits, share combinations and the like) for at
least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30
consecutive trading days ending on the first anniversary of our initial business
combination, each anchor investor may purchase from the sponsors, at a price per
Class A ordinary share of $0.01, a number of Class A ordinary shares no greater
than (a) the number of forward purchase shares issued and sold to such anchor
investor less any forward purchase shares sold by such anchor investor prior to
its exercise of the right to purchase such contingent call shares divided by (b)
18 (as adjusted for share splits, share combinations and the like).

The forward purchase agreements also provide that the anchor investors are
entitled to a right of first offer with respect to any proposed sale of
additional equity or equity-linked securities by us for capital raising purposes
in connection with the closing of our initial business combination (other than
forward purchase shares) and registration rights with respect to their forward
purchase securities.

The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to our initial business
combination each anchor investor has the right to designate one individual to
be, at its election, either elected as a member of our board of directors or a
non-voting observer of our board of directors.

The proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase shares may be used as part of
the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination, expenses
in connection with our initial business \combination or for working capital in
the post-transaction company. These purchases will be required to be made
regardless of whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public
shareholders and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for our
initial business combination.

The anchor investors will have no right to the funds held in the trust account
except with respect to any public shares owned by them."

million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us, including all of the underwriting discounts and
commissions of the selling shareholders. We will not receive any of the proceeds
from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares in the form of ADSs for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented
employees by providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional
capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:
 
• US$30.0 million for repayment in full of a short-term facility;

• approximately US$8.0 million for business development, including business 
  expansion through potential acquisitions;  

• approximately US$8.0 million for investment in product development; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The terms of our US$30 million short-term facility require us to repay it in
full within ten business days of the completion of this offering. The proceeds
of this short-term facility were used to pay a portion of a US$87.0 million
dividend to our shareholders in September 2017. No portion of the proceeds will
be used to make payments to our affiliates. The amounts and timing of any 
expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash generated by our
operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business, and our plans and 
business conditions. The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon
our present plans and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds
of this offering. Our management will have significant flexibility in applying 
and discretion to apply the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event
occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering
differently than as described in this prospectus.

As an offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations
to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries through loans or capital
contributions, subject to applicable regulatory approvals. We currently cannot
make loans or capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary, Rise Tianjin, without
first obtaining regulatory approvals, and if we decide to use the proceeds from
this offering within the PRC, we cannot assure you that we will be able to
obtain these regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. However, we do 
not plan to use the proceeds from this offering to provide funding to Rise
Tianjin or to our VIE, its subsidiaries or schools and the uses specified above
can generally be accomplished without transferring funds into the PRC. Moreover,
we believe the current cash reserves held by Rise Tianjin, our VIE and its
subsidiaries and schools, combined with the cash generated from their operating
activities, will be sufficient for our operating and expansion needs within the
PRC over the foreseeable future."

Common Stock we are offering will be approximately $14.5 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and $397,075 of estimated offering fees and

shares of Class B Common Stock is exercised in full, we estimate that our net
proceeds will be approximately $16.7 million.
 
We will retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds of this
offering. We currently intend to use approximately $1.7 million of the net
proceeds of this offering for the repayment of senior secured promissory notes
in the aggregate principal amount of $1.65 million, plus accrued interest (the
""Bridge Notes"").  The Bridge Notes bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum
through December 31, 2017, and a rate of 10% per annum thereafter. Interest is
payable monthly in arrears. The maturity date of the Bridge Notes is September
5, 2018.The principal amount and any unpaid interest accrued thereon may be
prepaid at any time before the maturity date without premium or penalty upon
five days prior written notice to the holders. If we consummate one or more
financing transactions resulting in available net proceeds of $5,000,000 or
more, then the holders of the Bridge Notes may require us to prepay the Bridge
Notes. The Bridge Notes are secured by an interest in all of our Collateral, as
such term is defined in the Bridge Notes.
 
We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general
corporate purposes, which may include purchases of additional inventory held for
sale, increased spending on marketing and advertising and capital expenditures
necessary to grow the business.  The net proceeds received by us may be used for
other purposes that our Board or management deem to be in our best interest.
This expected use of proceeds represents our intentions based on current plans
and business conditions. Thus, as of the date of this prospectus and except as
explicitly set forth herein, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending use of the net
proceeds of this offering as described above, we may invest the net proceeds in
short-term interest-bearing investment grade instruments.
 
Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash flow from
operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months."

offering, based on the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds of this offering as
follows:

. approximately $55.0 million to support the planned launch of XHANCE, including
  investments in marketing and sales, inventory and our commercial
  infrastructure;
 
. approximately $20.0 million to fund further development efforts for XHANCE,
  including the initiation of FDA-mandated pediatric studies, clinical trials
  necessary to seek approval for a follow-on indication of XHANCE for the
  treatment of chronic sinusitis and medical affairs activities; and
 
. the remainder to fund other working capital and general corporate purposes,
  including expenses to build corporate infrastructure to support us becoming a
  publicly-traded commercial company, including associated regulatory and
  quality activities.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
success of our commercialization efforts, the progress of our clinical
development efforts for XHANCE for a follow-on indication for the treatment of
chronic sinusitis and the progress of our preclinical and clinical development
efforts with respect to our other product candidates. As a result, our
management will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds from this
offering. An investor will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic,
financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use the
net proceeds.

Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for the
acquisition or licensing, as the case may be, of products, product candidates,
technologies, compounds, other assets or complementary businesses, we have no
current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so. Pending these uses,
we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash
resources, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations into the first
quarter of 2019, including to support the planned launch of XHANCE. With respect
to the additional research and development efforts for XHANCE, including the
initiation of FDA-mandated pediatric studies and the clinical trials necessary
to seek approval for a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic
sinusitis, we expect that we will require additional funds as these studies and
trials progress, the exact amounts of which will depend on the timing, design
and outcome of the clinical trials and our cash position. We have based these
estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may need to
raise additional capital through public offerings and private placements of our
equity securities, debt financings, strategic partnerships, alliances and
licensing arrangements, or a combination thereof."

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the rate of adoption of our products, the expenses we incur
in selling and marketing efforts, the scope of research and development efforts
and other factors described in this prospectus, as well as the amount of cash
used in our operations. We therefore cannot estimate the amount of net proceeds
to be used for all of the purposes described above. We may find it necessary or
advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described
above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.

"RESTORATION ROBOTICS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/restoration-robotics-inc-753744-84636,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/restoration-robotics-inc-753744-84636,424B4,10/13/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12325210,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of 3,575,000 shares of common
stock in this offering will be approximately $20.4 million, or approximately
$23.9 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the cash
received in connection with our convertible notes financing in September 2017,
together with the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $16.0 million to fund the continued commercialization of the
  ARTAS System, specifically expanding our U.S. and international sales and 
  distribution infrastructure, expanding our planned physician and consumer 
  marketing initiatives, and obtaining additional regulatory approvals;     

• approximately $2.0 million to complete the research and development of the
  robotic implantation functionality currently in clinical development;     

• approximately $5.0 million for other planned research and product development 
  activities, other than in connection with the robotic implantation 
  functionality, including improving and enhancing the ARTAS System and 
  Procedure with additional developments; and                    

• the remainder, if any, for working capital and general corporate purposes.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the development and
commercialization of our products, it is difficult to estimate with certainty
the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for
the above purposes. As such, our management will retain broad discretion over
the use of the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including: (i) the success of
our commercialization efforts for the ARTAS System, (ii) the amount of revenue
we are able to receive from the ARTAS System sales, servicing and procedure
based fees and (iii) our ability to receive regulatory approval for new product
features or new approved uses. We will use our existing cash and, potentially a
portion of the proceeds of this offering, to make scheduled payments of
principal and interest of approximately $0.7 million a month until July 1, 2019
at which time the final scheduled payment is $1.3 million on our outstanding
loan with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford. Our loan with Oxford accrues interest
at prime plus 8.5% per annum and matures July 1, 2019. 

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the cash
received in connection with the Convertible Notes, together with the net
proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations
for the 12 months following the date of this offering.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities."

A common stock in this offering will be approximately $33.1 million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters' option to purchase additional
shares of Class A common stock from us is exercised in full, we estimate that
our net proceeds would be approximately $43.6 million, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders, although we will bear the costs, other than underwriting discounts
and commissions, associated with the sale of these shares.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, improve our visibility in the marketplace, create a public market
for our Class A common stock, and facilitate our future access to the public
capital markets. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering
primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating
expenses, and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net
proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary technologies, solutions,
products, services, businesses, or other assets, although we have no present
commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or investments.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses of the net proceeds from this offering. The amount and timing of
our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the cash used
in or generated by our operations, sales and marketing efforts, competition, the
pace of our expansion plans, our investments, and acquisitions. Accordingly, we
will have broad discretion in using these proceeds. Pending these uses, we
intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term and
intermediate-term investment-grade interest-bearing securities and obligations,
such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. We cannot predict whether the
invested proceeds will yield a favorable return."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $497.5 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $17.00 per share and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to purchase
31,250,000 Common Units, or 35,937,500 Common Units if the underwriters exercise
their option in full to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock,
directly from Switch, Ltd. at a purchase price per Common Unit equal to the
initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock, less
underwriting discounts and commissions.

We intend to cause Switch, Ltd. to use the proceeds it receives for general
corporate purposes and working capital. We may also cause Switch, Ltd. to use a
portion of the net proceeds for the repayment of debt; to make cash payments to
the Members pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement; at our option, to make
cash payments to the Members upon their election to redeem any of their Common
Units; or for the acquisition of businesses or technologies that we believe are
complementary to our own, although we currently have no agreements, commitments
or understandings with respect to any specific acquisition. At this time, we
have not specifically identified a material single use for which we intend to
use the net proceeds (or cause the net proceeds to be used by Switch, Ltd.),
and, accordingly, we are not able to allocate the net proceeds among any
potential uses in light of the variety of factors that will affect how such net
proceeds will be ultimately used by us or Switch, Ltd. Our management will have
broad discretion to direct Switch, Ltd.’s use of the proceeds.

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock in full, we estimate that our additional net proceeds will
be approximately $75.3 million. We will use the additional net proceeds we
receive pursuant to any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares of Class A common stock to purchase additional Common Units
from Switch, Ltd. to maintain the one-to-one ratio between the number of shares
of Class A common stock issued by us and the number of Common Units owned by us."

As of June 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
of approximately $17.7 million and after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to
the aggregate gross proceeds of $20.5 million from the sale of our series A
preferred stock in August 2017, $38.2 million. We intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering, together with our existing cash resources, as follows:

• approximately $17 million to fund the development and manufacturing of
  setmelanotide through completion of our Phase 3 clinical trials and subsequent
  NDA submissions with the FDA for the treatment of POMC deficiency obesity and
  LepR deficiency obesity;

• approximately $14 million for the development of setmelanotide through
  completion of our Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trials for Bardet-Biedl
  syndrome, Alström syndrome, POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity and POMC
  epigenetic disorders, as well as the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical trial
  for Bardet-Biedl syndrome;

• approximately $16 million for initiatives to expand the diagnosis of genetic
  obesity, including research and scientific exchange related to our ongoing
  genotyping and genetic epidemiology studies;

• approximately $38 million for preparation for commercialization of
  setmelanotide; and

• the remainder for general working capital and administrative expenses,
  additional research and development expenses, and other general corporate
  purposes.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and other development
efforts for setmelanotide and other factors, as well as the amount of cash we 
use in our operations. As a result, our management will have broad discretion 
in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our 
judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. In 
addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or 
preclinical activities if the net proceeds from this offering and the other
sources of cash are less than expected.

Pending application of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds
from this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing 
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. We may still require significant
additional capital to fund the continued development of setmelanotide and our
operating needs thereafter. We expect to finance our additional cash needs
through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations,
strategic alliances and licensing arrangements."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we      
    received from our sponsor. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of
    this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at
    approximately $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these   
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may    
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in    
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not   
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     

Our sponsor has committed to purchase the private units (for an aggregate
purchase price of $4,000,000) from us on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Our sponsor has also
agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in
full or in part, it will purchase from us an additional number of private units
(up to a maximum of 45,000 private units) at a price of $10.00 per private unit
necessary to maintain in the trust account $10.05 per unit sold to the public in
this offering. These additional private units will be purchased in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting
from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private units are identical
to the units sold in this offering subject to certain limited exceptions. All of
the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account
described below.

$120,600,000, or $138,690,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account at Morgan Stanley, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States “government
securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which
invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with
respect to (i) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may
be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations and (ii) up to
$50,000 of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us to pay our liquidation and dissolution expenses, the proceeds
will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion
of a business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public
shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time
period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to our sponsor of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our benefit and
is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated officers and directors with
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area, that the fee charged by our
sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated
person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders.
Other than the $10,000 per month fee and the repayment of the $125,000 loan from
our sponsor (none of which payments will be made from the proceeds of this
offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial
business combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor,
officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered
to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
entity and individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review and approve all
reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or
their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such
review and approval. There is no limit on the amount of such expenses
reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed
the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such expenses would
not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination.
Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,
we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our sponsor, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to
3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable
finders’ fees which might become payable) upon consummation of our initial
business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business
combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from the up to $50,000 of interest that may be released
to us from the trust account to pay for our liquidation and dissolution
expenses. If such interest is insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to advance us
the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and has agreed not to seek
repayment of such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us an aggregate of
$125,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering for
SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan
will be payable without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loan
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment
of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 21 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of
the notes may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units
would be identical to the private units. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used for such repayment.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer,
in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek
to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their
shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or
affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete a business combination within 21 months from the
closing of this offering. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the
approval of any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director
or director nominee, or any other person. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account."

On June 1, 2017, Boxlight Parent, Mim Holdings, VC2 Partners and Vert Capital
Corp. were sued by Skyview for breach of the $1,460,508 restated note, breach of
guarantees of the restated note and is now seeking to foreclose on the assets of
our Mimio subsidiary. Effective as of October 2016, we transferred all of the
assets of our Mimio subsidiary and associated liabilities to our Boxlight, Inc.
subsidiary and recently liquidated the Mimio LLC entity. On September 6, 2017,
we paid Skyview the sum of $1,577,653.04, which included the principal balance
of $1,460,507.50, plus accrued interest of $117,145.54, due and payable to
Skyview under Amendment No 3 to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement dated
as of September 28, 2015, as amended on November 3, 2015, and as further amended
on June 30, 2016 among Skyview and Boxlight. Although we believe that we have
paid this obligation in full, Skyview may seek additional costs and penalties
and as of the date hereof, we have not received a release from Skyview in
connection with the pending lawsuit."

expenses of this offering payable by us, we expect net proceeds from this
offering of approximately $11.9 million (or $13.8 million if the underwriters’
option to purchase additional common shares from us is exercised in full), based
on an initial public offering price of $5.00 per share. The net proceeds from
this offering must be remitted to China before we will be able to use the funds
to grow our business. The procedure to remit funds may take several months after
completion of this offering, and we will be unable to use the offering proceeds
in China until remittance is completed. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows after we complete
the remittance process: 

. approximately $5.0 million for working capital of Beijing REIT and REIT 
  Changjiang for the purchase of raw materials, marketing and research and 
  development;

. approximately $3.5 million for acquisitions of other complimentary businesses,
  in the area of production of eco-friendly construction materials similar to 
  REIT Changjiang or REIT Xinyi. However, we have no current understandings,
  agreements or commitments for any specific material acquisitions at this time;

. approximately $2.9 million for the new plant construction for REIT Xinyi;

. approximately $500,000 in escrow for indemnity claims of the underwriters, 
  which sum could be returned to us after two years from the date of this 
  offering; and 

. any balance for additional working capital. 

The precise amounts and percentage of proceeds we devote to particular 
categories of activity, and their priority of use, will depend on prevailing 
market and business conditions as well as on the nature of particular 
opportunities that may arise from time to time. Accordingly, we reserve the
right to change the use of proceeds that we presently anticipate and describe
herein. Pending remitting the offering proceeds to China, we intend to invest
our net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, and investment-grade
obligations. These investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of an investment in our common shares. It is
possible that we may become a passive foreign investment company for U.S.
federal income taxpayers, which could result in negative tax consequences to
you.

Indemnification Escrow Agreement 

We have agreed with the underwriters to establish an escrow account in the
United States and to fund such account with $500,000 from this offering that may
be utilized by the underwriters to fund any bona fide indemnification claims of
the underwriters arising during a two-year period following the offering. The
escrow account will not be interest bearing, and we will be free to invest the
assets in certain securities during the two-year period. All funds that are not
subject to an indemnification claim will be returned to us after the two-year
period expires."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    borrowed from our sponsor described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units
    available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private placement units.

(3) Of the proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the units
    described in this prospectus, $60,000,000, or $69,000,000 if the 
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit),
    will initially be deposited into a trust account with Continental Stock 
    Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. We will have until 12 months 
    from the closing of this offering to consummate an initial business 
    combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to 
    consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, we may extend
    the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, 
    each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to 
    complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and 
    restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered
    into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date 
    of this prospectus, in order to extend the time available for us to 
    consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates 
    or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable 
    deadline, must deposit into the trust account $600,000, or up to $690,000 if
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.10 per 
    share in either case) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, 
    for each three month extension (or up to an aggregate of $1,200,000 (or up 
    to $1,380,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
    full), or $0.20 per share, if we extend for the full six months). 

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at 
    approximately $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our sponsor has committed to purchase the 250,000 private placement units from
us for a purchase price of $2,500,000 on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Our sponsor has also
agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in
full or in part, it will purchase from us up to an additional 22,500 private
placement units at a price of $10.00 per unit in an amount necessary to maintain
in the trust account at $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering.
These additional private placement units will be purchased in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting
from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private placement units are
identical to the units being sold in this offering, subject to certain limited
exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the proceeds we
receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.
 
$60,000,000, or $69,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units
will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting the conditions of paragraph (d) under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until
the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our redemption of
100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business
combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.
 
The payment to our sponsor of a monthly fee of an aggregate of up to $10,000 is
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our
benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated officers and
directors with compensation in lieu of a salary. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the
trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the up to $10,000 per month
fee and the repayment of loans from our sponsor (none of which payments will be
made from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
units held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business
combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, officers,
directors or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
entity and individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review and approve all
reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or
their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such
review and approval. There is no limit on the amount of such expenses
reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed
the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such expenses would
not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination.
Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,
we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.
 
Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our sponsor, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.
 
The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.
 
We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale
of the private placement units, including the funds held in the trust account,
to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the
extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to
effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are
not used to consummate a business combination (including to pay converting
stockholders as described herein) will be disbursed to the combined company and
will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital
to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target
business’s operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research
and development of existing or new products.
 
To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, A/Z Property has agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.
 
As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor and Chief Executive Officer have
loaned us an aggregate of $100,000 which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans
will be payable without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement units available to us for payment of offering expenses.
 
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 12 months (or up to 18 months from the
closing of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a
business combination by the full amount of time), assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of
the notes may be converted into private units at a price of $10.00 per unit
(which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000 shares of
common stock if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted since the 150,000 rights
included in such units would result in the issuance of 15,000 shares upon the
closing of our business combination, as well as 75,000 warrants to purchase
75,000 shares). The units would be identical to the private placement units. If
we do not complete a business combination, the loans will be forgiven.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer,
in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek
to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would restrict our public stockholders from converting or selling their
shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance
or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete a business combination within 12 months from the closing of this
offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the
period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time).
This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such
amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, whether
proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or
any other person. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of indebtedness.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the proceeds

based on a public offering price of $4.115 per share of common stock and $0.01

In addition, if all of the warrants offered pursuant to this prospectus are

We plan to use a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering to
finance acquisitions of, or investments in, competitive and complementary
businesses as a part of our growth strategy. We currently have no commitments in
place with respect to any such acquisitions or investments.

Working capital and general corporate purposes include amounts required to pay
for research and development expenses, salaries, professional fees, public
reporting costs, office-related expenses and other corporate expenses, including
interest and overhead.

Investors are cautioned that expenditures may vary substantially from the
estimates above. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management,
who will have broad discretion regarding the application of the proceeds of this
offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including our potential investments in new businesses,
remaining payments in connection with prior acquisitions, interest payments on
our outstanding debt, the amount of cash generated by our operations, the amount
of competition we face and other operational factors. We may find it necessary
or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other
purposes. From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we
anticipate continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing
allocation of resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being
optimized. Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds
include:

. our ability to negotiate definitive agreements with acquisition candidates;

. the availability and terms of debt financing to fund a portion of the purchase 
  price(s) for potential acquisitions;                                           

. the need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase or eliminate existing   
  initiatives due to, among other things, changing market conditions and         
  competitive developments; and                                                  

. the availability of other sources of cash including cash flow from operations  
  and new bank debt financing arrangements, if any.

$154.6 million (or approximately $171.3 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will
not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the
selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and enable
access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders.

We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, capital expenditures
and funding our growth strategies discussed in this prospectus (which include
driving new customer growth within existing geographic markets, penetrating our
existing customer base and expanding our global presence and continuing to
invest in our products and platform), to repay $90.0 million of the borrowings
outstanding under our term loan facility and to pay a related prepayment premium
of approximately $1.4 million. Our credit facility is expected to be amended in
connection with the consummation of this offering, and such amendment will
require that we use a portion of our net proceeds from this offering to repay an
amount of borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility to reduce the
aggregate outstanding principal amount thereof to $70.0 million (which repayment
will be subject to a prepayment premium of 1.50%). We may also use a portion of
our net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, services or
technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any
acquisitions at this time.

As of September 30, 2017, we had $160.0 million of borrowings outstanding under
our term loan facility. The term loan facility matures on August 16, 2021 and
bears interest at a variable rate. At September 30, 2017, the interest rate on
borrowings under our term loan facility was approximately 8.0%. All of the
outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility that were incurred within
one year were incurred for working capital, except $50.0 million was incurred in
June 2017 to partially fund a $50.4 million dividend paid to the holders of our
preferred stock on a pro rata basis.

Our expected uses of our net proceeds from this offering are based upon our
present plans, objectives and business condition. As of the date of this
prospectus, except for the repayment of $90.0 million of the borrowings
outstanding under our term loan facility and the payment of the related
approximately $1.4 million prepayment premium, we cannot predict with certainty
the particular uses for our net proceeds from this offering, and management has
not estimated the amount of proceeds, or the range of proceeds, to be used for
any particular purpose. As such, our management will have broad discretion in
the application of our net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of our net
proceeds. Pending the use of our proceeds from this offering as described above,
we intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term and long-term
interest-bearing obligations, including government and investment-grade debt
securities and money market funds."

We intend to contribute substantially all of the net proceeds of the offering to
the Bank as needed from time to time. The net proceeds will be used to support
the Bank's current growth, its future growth initiatives or selective 
acquisition activity, though no specific opportunities are currently under
consideration, while the Bank maintains being well-capitalized.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing unrestricted cash, as follows:

. approximately $35 million to $42 million for the pre-commercial planning and
  commercialization of Furoscix, if approved, including the development of our
  sales and marketing infrastructure;

. approximately $10 million to $25 million for research and development,     
  including for our infectious diseases program; and                         

. the remaining for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Based on our current plans, we believe our existing unrestricted cash, together
with the net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our
operations for at least 24 months following this offering.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. For example, we
may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses or
technologies to continue to build our pipeline, our research and development
capabilities and our intellectual property position, although we currently have
no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any such
transaction. We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts
that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the results of the review by the FDA of our NDA for Furoscix, the
progress of our research and development, the status of and results from
non-clinical studies or clinical trials we may commence in the future, as well
as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates or strategic opportunities that become available to us, and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation instruments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up
    to $585,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering and 
    for consulting services provided by third parties to the sponsor related to 
    this offering. As of the date of this prospectus, we have borrowed $574,000 
    from our sponsor. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this 
    offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
    for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. 
    In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, 
    any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $10,500,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $12,075,000 if the underwriters’ 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less
    amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount
    in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately
    $3,000,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in 
    the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this offering; 
    however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate
    assumes an interest rate of 1.0% per annum based upon current yields of
    securities in which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order
    to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
    combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may
    be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the 
    trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not 
    close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
    account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account
    would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans
    may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at
    a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
    be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor,
    including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The
    terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of
    our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written 
    agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans
    from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do
    not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
    waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust 
    account.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a ‘no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of the New York Stock Exchange provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to $10,500,000 (or up
to $12,075,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $3,000,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 1.0% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of
the principal or interest held in the trust account, except with respect to up
to $750,000 of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may
be released to us annually for working capital purposes or to pay our taxes, if
any, the proceeds from this offering will not be released from the trust account
until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination,
(ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24
months from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other
provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity,
and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, interest
earned on the trust account may not be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay (commencing on the effective date of this registration statement) our
sponsor a total of $10,000 per month. Our sponsor leases office space, which
includes utilities, secretarial support and other administrative services, from
an unaffiliated entity for $5,000 per month. A portion of our monthly fee will
reimburse our sponsor for granting us the right to use such services. None of
the $10,000 per month payment will be received by our officers or directors or
their affiliates. In addition, our sponsor will grant us access to members and
consultants of our sponsor that will provide us with administrative and
consulting services. We believe these types of arrangements are customary among
many SPACs. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$585,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering and for
consulting services provided by third parties to the sponsor related to this
offering. As of the date of this prospectus, we have borrowed $574,000 from our
sponsor. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of December 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. These loans will
be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering
proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor,
including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of
such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and
no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek
loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we
do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such 
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such 
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M 
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if 
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules 
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business
combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we
are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

approximately $109.8 million (or approximately $126.9 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our Class A
common stock from us in full) based on the initial public offering price of
$15.00 per share of Class A common stock, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, and create a public market for our Class A common stock.
As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. However, we
currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for
general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and
capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire
complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. However, we do not
have agreements or commitments to enter into any acquisitions at this time.

We will have broad discretion over how to use the net proceeds to us from this
offering. We intend to invest the net proceeds to us from the offering that are
not used as described above in investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

approximately US$162.5 million, or approximately US$187.6 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us, as well as net proceeds of approximately US$40 million
from the concurrent private placements.

As of the date of this prospectus, we have not allocated any specific portion of
the net proceeds of this offering for any particular purpose. We anticipate 
using the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placements 
for the following purposes:

• approximately US$60 million, to invest in research and development 
  capabilities, and data and technology;

• approximately US$40 million, to invest in branding and expand our sales and 
  marketing efforts; and

• the remaining amount to general corporate purposes, including working capital 
  needs and potential acquisitions (although we are not currently negotiating 
  any such acquisitions).

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of 
cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our
business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in
applying the net proceeds of the offering and the concurrent private placements.
If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the
proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placements differently than
as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private 
placements, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding
to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, we
may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiaries or make additional 
capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures
or working capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand 
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities."

Enterprise Associates 16, L.P., or NEA, in the concurrent private placement,
based on the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share and after
deducting placement agent fees payable by us, for aggregate net proceeds to be
raised by us in this offering and the concurrent private placement of $52.8
million.

As of September 30, 2017, we had cash of $26.3 million. We currently estimate
that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash, as follows:

• approximately $34 million to fund the development of ASN100 for the prevention
  of S. aureus pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients;

• approximately $7 million to fund the development of ASN100 for other 
  indications;

• approximately $6 million to advance our current pipeline of preclinical 
  candidates other than ASN500, which, in the near term, we plan to advance
  entirely with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, or the Gates 
  Foundation, and to research and develop additional preclinical product 
  candidates; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We currently estimate that, if we receive additional net proceeds of $18.6
million from the sale of shares of common stock to NEA in the concurrent private
placement, we will use such net proceeds as follows:

• approximately $6 million to fund the development of ASN100 for the prevention 
  of S. aureus pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients;

• approximately $1 million to fund the development of ASN100 for other
  indications;

• approximately $3 million to advance our current pipeline of preclinical
  candidates other than ASN500 and to research and develop additional 
  preclinical product candidates; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The foregoing cash of $26.3 million as of September 30, 2017 does not include
restricted cash of $5.5 million, consisting of (i) $4.7 million received under a
letter agreement with the Gates Foundation, which is restricted to use on
specified development activities in our ASN100 program, (ii) $0.4 million
received under a grant agreement with the Gates Foundation, which is restricted
to use on specified preclinical development activities in our ASN500 program,
and (iii) $0.4 million subject to letters of credit in connection with our
office leases.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement to NEA and our existing cash represents our intentions based upon our
current plans and business conditions, which could change in the future as our
plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development, the status of and results from clinical trials, the
timing of regulatory submissions and the outcome of regulatory review, as well
as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement to NEA.

We believe that the anticipated net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, capital
expenditure requirements and debt service payments into mid 2019, including the
completion of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of ASN100 and initiation of a
subsequent pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, assuming a successful outcome in our
Phase 2 clinical trial. We expect that we will require additional funding to
complete the clinical development of ASN100, commercialize ASN100, if we receive
regulatory approval, and pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product
candidates, if any. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with
product development, including the risks and uncertainties with respect to
successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials, at this time, we cannot
reasonably estimate the amount of additional funding that will be necessary to
complete the clinical development of ASN100 or any of our other product
candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for ASN100 or other product
candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to
product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement to NEA, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of
capital preservation investments, including short-term, investment-grade,
interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities."

through loans, subject to the approval of government authorities and limit on
the amount of capital contributions and loans. Subject to satisfaction of
applicable government registration and approval requirements, we may extend
inter-company loans to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China or make
additional capital contributions to our wholly-foreign-owned subsidiary to fund
its capital expenditures or working capital. For an increase of registered
capital of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary, we need to submit recordation of
modification documents with the MOC or its local counterparts within 30 days of
such increase of registered capital. If we provide funding to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary through loans, the total amount of such loans may not
exceed the difference between the entity’s total investment as approved by the
foreign investment authorities and its registered capital. Such loans must be
registered with SAFE or its local branches, which usually takes up to 20 working

and, to the extent proceeds from this offering are used to repay amounts
outstanding thereunder, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this

highest of (i) the London interbank offered rate for loans in Eurodollars for a
period of one month plus 1.00%, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%
or (iii) the interest rate established by the Administrative Agent as the
Administrative Agent’s prime rate plus (b) an applicable margin, which ranges
from 1.25% to 1.75% per annum based on a leverage ratio. As of June 30, 2017, we

U.S. offering, and €20.00 per ordinary share in the European private placement, 
after deducting underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us, and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase 806,104 
additional ADSs and/or ordinary shares. If the underwriters exercise in full 
their option to purchase additional ADSs and/or ordinary shares in the global 
offering, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the global offering
of approximately €112.4 million ($130.7 million), after deducting underwriting 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from the global offering as follows:

. approximately €42 ($50) million to conduct our planned pivotal Phase 3 
  clinical trial of eryaspase for the treatment of second-line metastatic    
  pancreatic cancer in the United States and Europe;                         

. approximately €17 ($20) million to conduct our planned pivotal Phase 3     
  clinical trial of eryaspase as a first-line treatment for adults with ALL; 

. approximately €17 ($20) million to advance the development of eryaspase and
  potential follow-on products for other indications;

Even with the expected net proceeds from the global offering, we may need to
raise additional capital in the future to conduct additional clinical
developments with eryaspase, including to fund our planned pivotal Phase 3
clinical trials and to complete the clinical development of other product
candidates. However, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our clinical trials that have
already commenced, including our Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States of
eryaspase for the treatment of ALL, our Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe of
eryaspase in ALL patients allergic to pegylated asparaginase and our Phase 2b
clinical trial in Europe of eryaspase for the treatment of AML. We have based
these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use
our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the global offering

the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,

GAAP. The maximum aggregate amount of such loan may vary with changes in the
relevant entities’ net assets at the time of calculation. As of the date of this

  HS patients;                                                                  

• approximately $18.0 million to conduct a Phase II clinical trial for IFX-1 in 
  AAV patients; and                                                         

• the remainder to fund other research and development activities, including to 
  complete the preclinical development of IFX-2 as an injectable therapy, to    
  explore additional indications for IFX-1 and to initiate later stage clinical 
  trials of IFX-1for HS and AAV, as well as for working capital and other       
  general corporate purposes.                                                   

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous 
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs,
including a change in our planned course of development or the termination of a
clinical program necessitated by the results of data received from clinical
trials. As a result, management will have broad discretion in the application of
the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might decide
to postpone or not pursue other clinical trials or preclinical activities if the
net proceeds from this offering and our other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next 24 months, including through completion of
our planned Phase IIb clinical trial for IFX-1 in HS patients and planned Phase
II clinical trial for IFX-1 in AAV patients. With respect to other research and
development activities, including clinical development of IFX-2 and conducting
clinical trials of IFX-1 for additional indications, we expect that we may
require additional funds as these programs progress, the amounts of which will
depend on the ultimate clinical development paths we pursue.

We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and
we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing financial assets and certificates
of deposit."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to support our organic 
growth and for general corporate purposes, including maintenance of our required
regulatory capital, and potential future acquisition opportunities. From time to
time, we evaluate and conduct due diligence with respect to potential 
acquisition candidates and may enter into letters of intent, although we do not
have any current plans, arrangements or understandings to make material

amount of approximately US$21.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts

the maximum offering amount of approximately US$79.0 million after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions, assuming a maximum commission fee of
7.00% of the offering price, and the estimated expenses payable by us.

We plan to use the net proceeds of the offering primarily to upgrade our
operating structure and build a stronger business framework, which includes
upgrading our risk control and management mechanism, privacy protection methods,
and anti-fraud and billing systems. In addition, we may use the proceeds for
brand building by implementing a multi-facet marketing strategy to promote our
brand through traditional media, search engine, online advertising and social
media coverage. Upon fulfilling capital requirement for business framework
upgrading and brand building, we may also use a portion of these proceeds for
general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and
capital expenditures.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering.
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to
apply the net proceeds of this offering, and investors will be relying on the
judgment of our management regarding the use of these net proceeds. If an
unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds
of this offering differently than as described in this prospectus.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, we
may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiary or make additional capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or
working capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, which may
delay or prevent us from providing the proceeds of this offering to our PRC
subsidiaries."

approximately $63.7 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in
this offering, based on the initial public offering price of $9.00 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, establish a public market for our common stock and
facilitate future access to the public equity markets by us, our employees and
our stockholders, obtain additional capital to support our operations, and
increase our visibility in the marketplace.

We intend to use approximately $9.2 million of the net proceeds we receive from
this offering to prepay in full the outstanding indebtedness under our term loan
with Pinnacle Ventures, L.L.C. This loan bears interest at a rate equal to the
greater of the prime rate plus 550 basis points, or 9.50% per annum, and matures
July 1, 2018. 

We currently intend to use the remaining net proceeds to us from this offering
primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and
marketing activities, product development, general and administrative matters,
and capital expenditures, although we do not currently have any specific or
preliminary plans with respect to the use of proceeds for such purposes. We also
may use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to acquire complementary
businesses, products, services or technologies, however, we do not have
agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date

for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. We will have
broad discretion over the use of our net proceeds of this offering.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing securities such as money market
accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations
of the U.S. government. We may also make illiquid minority investments in
private companies for strategic reasons, however, we do not have any agreements,
commitments or plans for any specific minority investments at this time.

The amounts and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending
on numerous factors, including our ability to gain access to additional
financing and the relative success and cost of our research and development
programs. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we
might decide to postpone or not pursue certain development activities if the net

concurrent private placement of $15.3 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions, private placement fees, and estimated offering
expenses. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares in this
offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
$16.8 million.

We expect the closing of the concurrent private placement to occur immediately
after the closing of the offering made hereby, but the closing of this offering
is not contingent on the closing of the concurrent private placement. We
estimate that, if no shares were to be purchased in the concurrent private
placement, we would receive net proceeds from this offering of $8.2 million,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares in this
offering were exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds of this
offering would be $9.7 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may
include financing our growth and developing new products. The other principal
purposes for this offering are to:

• create a public market for Class A common stock, which will, among other 
  things, provide future liquidity for our existing security holders;      

• facilitate our future access to the public capital markets; and

• improve the effectiveness of our equity compensation plans in attracting and
  retaining directors and key employees.                               

We may use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire businesses, technologies and
products that will help us expand the breadth and features of our product
offerings, provide access to new markets or customers, or otherwise complement
our existing operations. We assess acquisition opportunities on an ongoing
basis. We do not currently have any agreement with respect to an acquisition,
and we cannot assure you that we will make any acquisitions in the future.

Our expected use of the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly from our expectations depending upon numerous factors, including
our operating costs and capital expenditures and the factors. Because we cannot
currently specify with any certainty the particular uses of our net proceeds,
our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds.

Pending use of our net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments, certificates of
deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligation of the U.S. government."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this prospectus. These 
    loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses (other than underwriting discounts and commissions) and amounts not
    to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are 
    less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for 
    post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the offering 
    expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess 
    with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting discounts and commissions
    equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our
    initial business combination, $10,500,000, which constitutes the 
    underwriters’ deferred underwriting discounts and commissions (or 
    $12,075,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
    will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, 
    and the remaining funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay 
    redeeming shareholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or
    a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, 
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in 
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of 
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be 
    entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and 
    commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government 
    treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account
    will be approximately $60,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% 
    per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $10,500,000 (or $12,075,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, will be deposited into a U.S. based
trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company acting as trustee, and approximately $8,000,000, or approximately
$8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, will
be used to pay fees and expenses in connection with the closing of this offering
and for working capital following this offering. The proceeds held in the trust
account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $60,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 0.02% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this
amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our income tax obligations, if any,
the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants
will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of (a)
the completion of our initial business combination (including the release of
funds to pay any amounts due to any public shareholders who properly exercise
their redemption rights in connection therewith), (b) the redemption of any
public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to
approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (c) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that the
interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to
pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans
in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse our sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial support
and administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an
amount equal to $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31,
2017 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the
trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise
price, exercisability and exercise period. Except as set forth above, the terms
of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist
with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business
combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor
or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account.

We plan to enter into an Option Agreement with the CSL Funds pursuant to which
the CSL Funds will havethe right to subscribe for an aggregate of up to
10,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, plus an aggregate of up to 3,333,333
warrants, for a purchase price of $10.00 per Co-Investment Unit, or an aggregate
purchase price of up to $100,000,000 in connection with our initial business
combination. The proceeds from the Co-Investment, to the extent subscribed for
by the CSL Funds, may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in our
initial business combination, expenses in connection with our initial business
combination or for working capital in the post-transaction company.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ. However, they have no
current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have
not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage
in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the redemption of any public shares
properly submitted in connection with our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance
or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not
consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering or (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

from our sale of common stock in this offering, or approximately $79.1 million
if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,
based on the initial public offering price of $14.00 per share and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $40.0 million to fund our Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994 and 
  initiate our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994;      

• approximately $18.0 million to fund additional preclinical activities relating
  to SPR741 and our planned Phase 2 clinical trial of SPR741;    

• approximately $7.0 million to fund additional preclinical and IND-enabling 
  studies to develop SPR206 and SPR720; and                  

• the remainder, if any, balance for working capital and other general corporate
  purposes.                                                     

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licensing of complementary companies,
medicines or technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any specific acquisitions or in-licensing at this time, we
may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering as described above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of
funds is necessary. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development
process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net
proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in applying the net 
proceeds from this offering. An investor will not have the opportunity to 
evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we base our 
decisions on how to use the proceeds.

Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash
equivalents, together with the net proceeds from this offering, will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements into the second quarter of 2019. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not expect the net proceeds
from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient
to fund the development of our product candidates through regulatory approval
and commercialization. In particular, we anticipate that those funds will not be
sufficient to enable us to complete our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial
of SPR994. We believe the amount of net proceeds from this offering currently
allocated to SPR206 and SPR720 would only be sufficient to fund those programs
to the point where we would be in a position to file an IND with respect to
each. We will need to raise substantial additional funds before we can expect to
commercialize any products, if approved. We may satisfy our future cash needs
through the sale of equity securities, debt financings, working capital lines of
credit, corporate collaborations or license agreements, grant funding, interest
income earned on invested cash balances or a combination of one or more of these
sources.

Pending their use as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds from
this offering in short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $66.4 million at the initial
public offering price of $14.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $76.9 million after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, as follows:

• approximately $45.0 million for our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical program
  of ALLN-177 for the treatment of patients with enteric hyperoxaluria,
  including clinical research outsourcing and drug manufacturing;

• approximately $3.0 million for our planned Phase 2 clinical trial of ALLN-177
  in adolescents and adults with primary hyperoxaluria or severe forms of
  secondary hyperoxaluria, including clinical research outsourcing and drug
  manufacturing;

• approximately $3.0 million for our planned development of ALLN-346 for the
  treatment of patients with hyperuricemia and CKD, including preclinical proof
  of concept in hyperuricemia animal models, customary toxicology studies and
  preparation for filing of an investigational new drug application;

• approximately $8.0 million to fund our process validation and manufacturing
  batches for ALLN-177; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which
  includes making scheduled principal and interest payments under our existing
  $10.0 million credit facility, funding for additional research, hiring
  additional personnel, capital expenditures and the costs of operating as a
  public company.

As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal balance of our credit facility
was $10.0 million. The credit facility has an interest only period that expires
in December 2017. Upon the expiration of the interest only period, the
outstanding amounts will be repaid over 30 months in equal monthly principal
payments plus monthly payments of accrued interest. The outstanding principal
balance accrues interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of
4.0% or 0.5% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the credit facility). At June
30, 2017, the interest rate was 4.75%. In addition, we are required to make a
final payment equal to 8.25% of the original principal amount, which is due on
the earliest to occur of (a) the loan maturity date, which is May 1, 2020, (b)
upon an acceleration of the loan in accordance with the credit facility or (c)
the prepayment of the then outstanding principal balance.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. We cannot
predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be
received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will
actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amount and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our
research and development efforts, the timing of regulatory submissions and the
feedback from regulatory authorities, the timing and success of our planned
clinical trials, preclinical studies, or studies or trials we may commence in
the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. Moreover, our
estimates of the costs to fund our planned clinical trials are based on our
expected designs of the trials. If the design of any of these trials were to be
modified, for instance, to increase the number of patients in the trials, our
costs to fund the trials could increase. As a result, our management will have
broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering.

Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the
acquisition or licensing, as the case may be, of additional technologies, other
assets or businesses, or for other strategic investments or opportunities, we
have no current understandings, agreements, commitments or plans to do so.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash, cash equivalents and investments, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service, and
capital expenditure requirements into 2020. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect.

Based on our current operating expectations, we estimate that we will have
sufficient resources to complete (i) our two planned Phase 3 clinical trials of
ALLN-177 in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria, (ii) our planned Phase 2
clinical trial of ALLN-177 in adolescents and adults with primary hyperoxaluria
and other severe forms of hyperoxaluria and (iii) our planned proof of concept
and customary preclinical toxicology studies of ALLN-346 and, subject to the
successful outcome of these studies, the filing of our IND. We will need to
raise additional proceeds to secure marketing approval and to fund the
commercialization of ALLN-177 if marketing approval is obtained as well as
continue the development of ALLN-177 in other indications and advance ALLN-346
into clinical development.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we
expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt
financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. With
the exception of our credit facility, we do not have any committed external
source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale
of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our
existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may
include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights
of our common stockholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve
agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take
specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures
or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our
business.

If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing
arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to
our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product
candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we
are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when
needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product
development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and
market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market
ourselves.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit or
government securities."

any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling
stockholders. We intend to use the net proceeds received by us in this offering
to repay approximately $100.5 million of indebtedness (including accrued and
unpaid interest) under the Term Loan Facility and any remainder for general
corporate purposes.

The interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, including the
October 2016 Incremental Term Loans, as of June 30, 2017 was London Interbank
Offered Rates (""LIBOR"") + 3.75% and the maturity date is January 15, 2021. The
interest rate on borrowings under the NB Incremental Loans as of June 30, 2017
was LIBOR + 4.50% and the maturity date is January 15, 2021. We incurred the NB
Incremental Loans on April 15, 2016, which provided for the borrowing of
$185.0 million of incremental term loans under the Term Loan Facility to finance
the Neptune-Benson Acquisition, refinance certain then-existing indebtedness of
Neptune-Benson and pay fees and expenses in connection with such transactions.
As of August 8, 2017, the NB Incremental Loans are no longer outstanding. We
entered into the October 2016 Refinancing on October 28, 2016, to (i) borrow an
additional $150.0 million of incremental term loans under the Term Loan Facility
to fund our repayment in full of the Second Lien Facility and revolving credit
loans then outstanding and (ii) increase commitments under the Revolving Credit
Facility by $20.0 million to a total of $95.0 million. We entered into the
August 2017 Refinancing on August 8, 2017 in order to (i) borrow approximately
$262.7 million of refinancing term loans, the net proceeds of which were used to
refinance in their entirety the NB Incremental Loans and (ii) borrow an
additional $80.0 million of incremental term loans under the Term Loan Facility,
the net proceeds of which were used to repay $60.0 million of revolving credit
loans then outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and to pay related
fees and expenses, and for other general corporate purposes (including permitted
acquisitions and permitted investments pursuant to the First Lien Credit
Agreement). Pursuant to the August 2017 Refinancing, a single tranche of term
loans is outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement, with the same terms,
including pricing terms, as the First Lien Term Facility immediately prior to
the August 2017 Refinancing. The terms governing the NB Incremental Loans were
superseded in their entirety by the terms set forth in the August 2017

approximately US$94.4 million, or approximately US$109.5 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for general corporate purposes,
which may include investment in product development, sales and marketing
activities, technology infrastructure, capital expenditures, improvement of
corporate facilities and other general and administrative matters. We may also
use a portion of these proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,
technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business, although we
have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions
or investments.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries in China only through loans or capital contributions and to our
variable interest entities only through loans, subject to the approval of
government authorities and limit on the amount of capital contributions and
loans. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

us, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $36.9 million from this
offering if we complete the minimum offering, or approximately $51.2 million if
we complete the maximum offering, assuming we sell half of the shares at a 3%
commission and half at a 6% commission. We intend to use the net proceeds of
this offering as follows (as to such uses in China, after we complete the
remittance process described below), and we have listed the specific uses of
proceeds below. We do not expect that our priorities for fund allocation would
change if the amount we raise in this offering exceeds the size of the minimum
offering but is less than the maximum offering.

Approximately $29.5 million of the net proceeds (if we complete the minimum
offering) and approximately $41.0 million of the net proceeds (if we complete
the maximum offering) will be remitted to China before we are able to use those
funds to expand our business. We are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to
provide funding to Dongguan Dogness and Dongguan Jiasheng (the “PRC
Subsidiaries”), through capital contributions or parent/subsidiary loans,
subject to approvals from or registrations with relevant PRC government
authorities. We plan to use the capital contribution to fund the PRC
Subsidiaries. We expect that a properly submitted application will be approved
in the ordinary course of business; however, we cannot guarantee such an
approval will occur or be timely. If our application for a capital contribution
is denied, we will use the parent/subsidiary loan method of funding the PRC
Subsidiaries.

As mentioned, we currently anticipate financing our subsidiaries by means of
capital contributions. We currently anticipate using a portion of the net
proceeds from this offering (total net proceeds of approximately $41.0 million
if we complete the maximum offering) to increase the registered capital of the
PRC Subsidiaries. The increase in registered capital will require (i)
registration with MOFCOM to increase the PRC Subsidiaries’ registered capital,
(ii) registration with SAIC to alter the PRC Subsidiaries’ business certificate
to reflect the increase in registered capital and (iii) approval from SAFE to
allow the PRC Subsidiaries’ bank to convert U.S. dollars into RMB in order to
fund such increased registered capital, or each of the foregoing agencies’
respective local counterparts. This approval process typically takes 30 to 90
days in total, and sometimes longer, from the time MOFCOM or its local branches
receive all the required application documents to begin the process.

We plan to remit money to China using the capital contribution method. The
registration with MOFCOM is the key step in the capital contribution process,
and we believe all other approvals are ministerial if MOFCOM registers such
increase in registered capital. We have not yet initiated this process but
intend to start the process immediately upon completion of the offering. We do
not foresee any problem receiving necessary government approvals for a capital
contribution. If we fund the PRC Subsidiaries through a capital contribution,
the amount of our contribution is subject to increasing our registered capital,
as described above, and applying to change the approved investment amount is not
required.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete these government
registrations or obtain the relevant approvals on a timely basis, if at all. The
procedure to remit funds may take several months after completion of this
offering, and we will be unable to use the funds in China until remittance is
completed. We have not yet initiated the process of remitting money to China
using either method but will begin to do so promptly upon completion of this
offering. While we anticipate we will begin to upgrade our factory building
approximately three months after completion of this offering and will complete
such upgrades between 15 and 18 months after commencement, this anticipation is
based on timely remittance of IPO proceeds so that we can use such funds in
China; any delay in the remittance process would set back commencement and
completion of such project accordingly.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our Class A Common Shares. It is possible that we may become
a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers, which
could result in negative tax consequences to you.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The occurrence of
unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of
the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this
prospectus."

offering will be approximately $68.9 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $13.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares in this offering, we
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $79.8 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, facilitate access to the public equity markets, increase our
visibility in the marketplace and obtain additional capital.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and
general corporate purposes. In addition, we believe that opportunities may exist
from time to time to expand our current business through acquisitions of or
investments in complementary products, technologies or businesses. While we have
no agreements, commitments or understandings for any specific acquisitions at
this time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for these
purposes. We do not intend to use any of the net proceeds from this offering to
pay the special dividend of $43.0 million declared by our board of directors
that is contingent upon, and payable following, the closing of this offering to
the holders of record of our stock as of November 30, 2017, or the further cash
payments of $7.0 million to be made to holders of our stock options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock units as equitable adjustments approved
by our board of directors for payment in connection with this dividend in the
event that it is paid.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds. The timing and amount
of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows
from operations, the anticipated growth of our business, and the availability
and terms of alternative financing sources to fund our growth. Pending use of
the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade securities,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government. The goal with respect to the investment of these net proceeds will
be capital preservation and liquidity so that these funds are readily available
to fund our operations."

$258.6 million ($298.3 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in full), based on the
initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions in connection with this offering and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We currently intend to contribute all of the net proceeds of this offering
(including any net proceeds received in connection with the underwriters’ option
to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) to Newmark OpCo in
exchange for a number of units representing Newmark OpCo limited partnership
interests equal to the number of shares issued by us in this offering. Newmark
OpCo intends to use all of such net proceeds to partially repay intercompany
indebtedness owed by Newmark OpCo to us in respect of the Term Loan (which
intercompany indebtedness was originally issued by BGC U.S. and will be assumed
by Newmark OpCo in connection with the separation). We currently intend to use
all of such repayment from Newmark OpCo to partially repay the Term Loan. The
Term Loan has an outstanding principal amount of $575.0 million, plus accrued
but unpaid interest thereon, with an interest rate calculated based on one-month
LIBOR plus 2.25%, subject to adjustment, which was approximately 3.5% per annum
as of September 30, 2017. The Term Loan will mature on September 8, 2019. The
terms of the Term Loan require that the net proceeds of this offering be used to
repay the Term Loan until the Term Loan is repaid in full. Following this
offering, we estimate that the Term Loan will have an outstanding principal
amount of approximately $316.4 million, plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon
($276.7 million, plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in
full)."

    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per public

    if exercised) in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory   
    note.                                                                        

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
    these items may differ from the estimates set forth in this prospectus. For  
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business          
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. 
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject
    to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with    
    legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition,
    our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of       
    consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not      
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in 
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust     
    account.                                                                     

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the gross proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
units, a total of $125,000,000 (or $143,750,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be placed in a trust account
with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., in the United States in New York, New York,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and
will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S.
Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may be released to us to pay
taxes and up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses, as discussed below, none
of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust account
until the earlier of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination
within the required time period; (2) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding
public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination in the
required time period; and (3) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within the required time period or (B) with respect to any
other provision relating to our pre-business combination activity and related
stockholders’ rights.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our Sponsor or an affiliate of
our Sponsor or our executive officers and directors, but such members of our
management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in,
us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the NYSE, we have
agreed to pay our Sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space,
utilities and secretarial and administrative services. Upon completion of our
initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our Sponsor, executive officers,
directors, director nominees or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering
proceeds held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up
to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into additional units of the
post-business combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of
the lender. The units would be identical to the private units. The terms of such
loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no
written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be
further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination.
If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of Common Stock that
such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of
this offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of this offering if we extend
the period of time to consummate a business combination), or, if our charter
documents are amended to so provide, (iii) the redemption of our public shares
in connection with a stockholder vote to amended and restated certificate of
incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 15 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 18 months from the
closing of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a
business combination), or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-businesscombination activity, subject to applicable
law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or
interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our Founders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares, private shares and shares underlying any warrants included in
the private units in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination. Our Founders have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any public shares purchased during or after this offering in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. In
addition, our Founders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions with respect to its founder shares if we fail to consummate our
initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering
(or up to 18 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of
time to consummate a business combination). However, if our Founders acquire
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to receive
liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to
consummate our initial business combination within the required time period."
DENALI THERAPEUTICS INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/denali-therapeutics-inc-1037359-85317,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/denali-therapeutics-inc-1037359-85317,424B4,12/8/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12421247,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 13,888,888
shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $229.0 
million, based on the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share, after 
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional shares in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately $263.9 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We currently
anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing resources, through 2019 as follows:

• approximately $20 to $25 million to fund the costs of Phase 1 trials in
  healthy volunteers for each of DNL201 and DNL151 and a Phase 1b study in LRRK2
  mutation-carrying Parkinson’s disease patients, as well as preparation for a 
  potential future Phase 2 clinical trial;                

• approximately $30 to $35 million to fund the costs to advance our RIPK1 
  program through Phase 1 and early Phase 2 clinical development, substantially
  represented by the planned Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, 
  including a cohort in Alzheimer’s disease patients, for DNL747 and a Phase 2a
  clinical trial in ALS patients and a Phase 2a clinical trial in Alzheimer’s 
  disease patients;                                    

• approximately $45 to $50 million to optimize and broaden our ATV and ETV
  platform technologies and to advance our four core antibody and enzyme 
  replacement programs through preclinical development and IND-enabling 
  activities;                                                               

• if we exercise our option to acquire all outstanding shares of F-star Gamma,
  in the aggregate, approximately $18.0 million to $50.0 million to fund the 
  initial exercise payments; and                                   

• the remainder to fund seed programs, general research and development     
  activities, working capital and other general corporate activities.       

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through license or acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary
businesses, products or technologies. While we currently have no agreements or
commitments to complete any such transaction at this time, we may use a portion
of the net proceeds for these purposes.

The net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our
product candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise
additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our
product candidates. We expect to finance our incremental cash needs through a
combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential licenses and
collaboration agreements. This expected use of net proceeds from this offering
represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions,
which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the
status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that
we may enter into with third parties for our programs, and any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds. We cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this
offering.

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the proceeds
in a variety of capital preservation investments, including interest-bearing,
investment-grade instruments and U.S. government securities."

underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses, will
be approximately $120.1 million, or approximately $138.4 million if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering (i) to fund a cash
distribution to our existing shareholders immediately after the closing of this
offering in the amount of $40.0 million — purchasers of our common stock in this
offering will not be entitled to receive any portion of this distribution; and
(ii) to use the remainder of the net proceeds, which we estimate to be
approximately $80.1 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and the
estimated offering expenses), or $98.4 million (after deducting underwriting
discounts and the estimated offering expenses) if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full, to increase the capital of the Bank
in order to support our growth strategies, for working capital and for other
general corporate purposes, and to strengthen our regulatory capital.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the proceeds. Pending their use at the
Bank to fund loans or investment securities, we expect that we would use all or
a portion of the net proceeds to pay off FHLB borrowings, which can be
reborrowed, if necessary, to fund loan growth."

stock that we are offering will be approximately $82.3 million, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses. If the underwriters
fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $95.3 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase, redeem,
defease or otherwise repay portions of the 12.00% Senior Secured Notes issued by
CFTC and pay fees, expenses, premiums and accrued interest in connection
therewith. CFTC issued $470 million aggregate principal amount of the 12.00%
Senior Secured Notes on February 15, 2017 in a private offering exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and used the proceeds of that
offering, together with available cash, to redeem Curo Intermediate’s
outstanding 10.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2018, redeem our 12.00% Senior Cash
Pay Notes due 2017 and pay fees, expenses, premiums and accrued interest in
connection therewith. On November 2, 2017, CFTC issued $135 million aggregate
principal amount of additional 12.00% Senior Secured Notes in a private offering
exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and used the
proceeds from that offering, together with available cash, to pay a cash
dividend to our stockholders and pay fees and expenses in connection therewith.

Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to
invest the net proceeds we receive in this offering in short-term and
intermediate term interest-bearing obligations, investment grade investments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed U.S. government obligations."

offered by us in this offering, based on the initial public offering price of
$24.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• Approximately $65 million to conduct our multinational, multicenter, 
  randomized, Phase 3 study in patients with MBC, known as CONTESSA;        

• Approximately $20 million to conduct other clinical studies of tesetaxel; and
 
• Approximately $20 million on manufacturing activities relating to tesetaxel.

The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for working capital and general
corporate purposes.

Our expected use of proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based on our present plans and business condition. As of the date of
this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for
the proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the actual
amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above. We may also use a
portion of the proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in additional
businesses, technologies, products or assets. Although we have no specific
agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any in-licensing
activity or acquisition, we evaluate these opportunities and engage in related
discussions with other companies from time to time.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the results of our research and development efforts, the
timing and outcome of any ongoing or future preclinical or clinical studies, and
the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions. As a result, our management
will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds from this offering.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we may invest the proceeds

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, or
approximately $65.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option to

discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering: (1) to expand
our life sciences commercial operations to grow and support the installed base
of our products among life sciences research customers in the United States and
internationally; (2) to improve and update our Simoa technology and instruments
and to develop additional assays, including assays for nucleic acid detection;
(3) to support the launch of our new Quanterix SR-X instrument, currently
scheduled for launch in 2018; (4) to potentially move into a larger corporate
headquarters in order to have the appropriate infrastructure to support the
increase in our employee base in addition to an increase in our manufacturing
footprint; (5) to pursue regulatory approvals or clearances to develop
instruments, assay kits and consumables in areas outside of life science
research, including potentially LDTs, IVD tests and other markets, and, subject
to receipt of such necessary regulatory approvals or clearances, to develop such
instruments, assay kits and consumables; (6) to potentially pursue acquisitions
or other business development opportunities; and (7) for working capital and
other general corporate purposes. We do not currently market our products
outside of the research use only market in part because we do not have the
regulatory clearances that would be necessary for us to do so, nor have we begun
the process of obtaining any such regulatory clearances. Furthermore, we may
require additional funds to pursue any required regulatory approvals or
clearances.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies or
technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or understandings
for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion
of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering as described above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of
funds is necessary. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development
process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net
proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors,
including our sales and marketing and commercialization efforts, demand for our
technology, our operating costs and the other factors.  Accordingly, our 
management will have flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this 
offering. An investor will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, 
financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use the
proceeds.

Pending their use as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of an aggregate of $300,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering from
    offering proceeds that have been allocated to pay offering expenses and
    amounts not to be held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the
    completion of our initial business combination, $10,500,000, which
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $12,075,000 if the
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) The amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from
    the trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested
    only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or
    less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
    under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
    treasury obligations. We estimate the after-tax interest earned on the trust
    account will be approximately $875,000 per year, assuming an interest rate
    of 0.5% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this
    amount.

Of the $308,000,000 in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $353,900,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $300,000,000
($10.00 per unit), or $345,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer& Trust Company acting as trustee, and $8,000,000, or
$8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, will
be used to pay underwriting commissions and expenses in connection with the
closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be invested only in U.S. government
treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate the after-taxinterest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$875,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.5% per year; however, we can
provide no assurances regarding this amount. We will not be permitted to
withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account, except for
the withdrawal of interest to pay our income taxes, if any, until the earliest
of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption
of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted
in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance
or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not
consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering. Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest earned
on the trust account will be sufficient to pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation
of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, in addition to the interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us as described
above, will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds
are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin
preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication
of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the
circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that
addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
our sponsor, members of our management team or any of their affiliates, but such
persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative
services provided to members of our management team, in an amount not to exceed
$20,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the date of this prospectus, our sponsor loaned us $300,000 to be used
for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest
bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of April 30, 2018 or the closing
of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out
of the funds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor, officers or directors or
their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required
on an interest-free basis. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account
released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held
outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the
trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity
at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our
initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor, officers or directors or their affiliates as we do not believe
third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against
any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. The terms of
any such loans have not been determined and no written agreement exists with
respect thereto.

We intend to enter into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant
to which it has agreed to purchase an aggregate of up to 25,000,000 shares of
our Class A ordinary shares, plus an aggregate of up to 8,333,333 warrants, for
a purchase price of $10.00 per forward purchase unit, or an aggregate purchase
price of up to $250,000,000 in a private placement that will close substantially
concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. Our sponsor
will purchase a number of forward purchase units that will result in gross
proceeds to us necessary to enable us to consummate our initial business
combination and pay related fees and expenses, after first applying amounts
available to us from the trust account (after paying the deferred underwriting
discounts and commissions and giving effect to any redemptions of public shares)
and any other financing source obtained by us for such purpose at or prior to
the consummation of our initial business combination, plus any additional
amounts mutually agreed by us and our sponsor to be retained by the post-
business combination company for working capital or other purposes. These
purchases will be required to be made regardless of whether any shares of
Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders in connection
with our initial business combination and are intended to provide us with a
minimum funding level for our initial business combination."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsors and strategic investor of up to $400,000 as described in
    this prospectus. On September 28, 2017, we borrowed $375,000 under the
    promissory notes with our sponsors and strategic investor to be used for a
    portion of the expenses of this offering. This amount will be repaid upon
    completion of this offering out of the $825,000 of offering proceeds that
    has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than
    underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in the trust account.
    In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table,
    any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In
    the event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this
    table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering, which includes 0.5% of the gross
    proceeds of this offering that may be awarded to a broker-dealer at the sole
    discretion of the Company. Upon completion of our initial business
    combination, $7,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred
    commissions (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in
    the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The 
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would
    expect approximately $4,000,000 of interest to be earned from the funds held
    in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this offering; 
    however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. Interest earned
    on the funds held in the trust account may be released to us to pay our
    franchise and income tax obligations. This estimate assumes an interest rate
    of 1.0% per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust
    account may be invested.

(5) In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
    business combination, our sponsors and our strategic investor have committed
    an aggregate of $1,000,000, in accordance with the unsecured promissory
    notes we will issue to our sponsors and strategic investor pursuant to the
    expense advance agreement between us and our sponsors and our strategic
    investor, to be provided to us and from which we may draw down from time to
    time to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target
    business and other working capital requirements after this offering and
    prior to our initial business combination.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $200,000,000 (or $230,000,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $7,000,000 (or $8,050,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $2,000,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 1.0% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise
and income tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the
private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on assumed interest
rates, we expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income
taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsors, members of our management team or
their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds
to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date our securities are first listed on the NASDAQ Capital
Market, we have agreed to pay our Hydra sponsor, or its affiliates or assignees,
a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and
administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

We entered into promissory notes with our sponsors and strategic investor
whereby they agreed to loan us up to an aggregate of $400,000 to be used for a
portion of the expenses of this offering. As of September 28, 2017, we had
borrowed $375,000 under the promissory notes with our sponsors and strategic
investor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. The loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30, 2018
or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsors and our strategic investor
have committed an aggregate of $1,000,000, in accordance with the unsecured
promissory notes we will issue to our sponsors and our strategic investor
pursuant to the expense advance agreement between us and our sponsors and our
strategic investor, to be provided to us and from which we may draw down from
time to time in the event that funds held outside of the trust are insufficient
to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business
and other working capital requirements after this offering and prior to our
initial business combination and may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as
may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust
account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we
may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay
such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to
repay such loaned amounts. Such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a
price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be 
identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, 
exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such loans by our officers and
directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with
respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than 
our sponsors or our strategic investor or an affiliate of our sponsors or our 
strategic investor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan 
such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to 
funds in our trust account.

Our strategic investor, HG Vora Special Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd., has
agreed to enter into a contingent forward purchase contract with us to purchase,
in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately $62,500,000 to occur
concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination,
6,250,000 of our units on substantially the same terms as the sale of units in
this offering at $10.00 per unit. In the event the gross proceeds from this
offering are less than $200,000,000, the total number of private placement units
to be purchased by our strategic investor under the contingent forward purchase
contract will be reduced proportionally. However, the total number of private
placement units to be purchased by our strategic investor under the contingent
forward purchase contract will not change in the event the gross proceeds from
this offering are more than $200,000,000. The funds from the sale of the private
placement units may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the
initial business combination; any excess funds from this private placement of
units may be used for working capital in the post-transaction company. This
commitment is independent of the percentage of stockholders electing to redeem
their shares and provides us with an increased minimum funding level for the
initial business combination. Our strategic investor’s obligation to purchase
our units under the contingent forward purchase contract is contingent upon,
among other things, our strategic investor approving the business combination,
which approval can be withheld for any reason.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any
founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial
stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to
complete our business combination within the prescribed timeframe. However, if
our sponsors or strategic investor or any of our officers, directors or
affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed timeframe."
