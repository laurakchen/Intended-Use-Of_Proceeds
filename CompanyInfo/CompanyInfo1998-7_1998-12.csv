shares of Common Stock offered hereby are approximately $32.6 million 
(approximately $37.6 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full), at the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share 
and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital, product development and capital 
expenditures. In particular, the Company expects to use a portion of the net 
proceeds to expand its facilities. The Company believes it will require up to 
50,000 additional square feet of office, manufacturing and research and 
development space in the next 24 months. A portion of the net proceeds may also 
be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to 
obtain the right to use complementary technologies. The Company has no 
agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition or investment, 
and the Company is not currently engaged in any material negotiations with 
respect to any such transaction. Pending such uses, the net proceeds of the 
Offering will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade 
securities."

$8,000,000 if the minimum number of Shares are sold, $12,000,000 if the maximum 
number of Shares offered hereby are sold, and $13,800,000 if all Shares subject 
to the Oversubscription Allotment are sold, in each case before deducting 
expenses of the Offering, which are estimated at $110,000. 

The Company will initially use $7,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering 
to purchase all of the then-issued common stock of the Bank. Additionally, the 
Company will pay all of the organizational expenses of the Company and the Bank 
from the proceeds of the Offering, including through repayment of funds 
advanced to the Company by the organizers. If more than $8,000,000 of net 
proceeds is raised in the Offering, the Company may use all or a portion of the 
additional proceeds for purchase of more shares of the Bank's common stock (or 
otherwise contribute such funds to the Bank) or may retain all or a portion of 
the additional proceeds in the Company for general corporate purposes, 
including permitting the Company to engage in business activities permitted for 
bank holding companies, and to meet future accounting, legal and regulatory 
expenses (See ""SUPERVISION AND REGULATION""). There can be no assurance that the 
Company will not be required to contribute to the capital of the Bank more than 
the amount currently anticipated as a condition to the approval of the Bank's 
charter or the establishment of its planned branches. 

The Bank will apply the proceeds of the sale of its capital stock to the 
Company to furnish and equip the Bank's premises and the Company's offices (at 
an estimated cost of $833,000), to provide working capital for expansion, to 
fund lending activities and for general corporate purposes (including the 
investment of all or a portion of the working capital funds in interest-bearing 
certificates of deposit or other deposits with the Bank or other types of 
securities, such as government bonds). Certain of the expenses attributable to 
the Bank for furnishing and equipping premises and offices may be initially paid
 through organizer advances, and the Bank or Company will repay the organizer 
loans reflecting such expenses. 

Set forth below is a tabular presentation reflecting the anticipated allocation 
of the net proceeds of the Offering, after deducting estimated expenses of the 
Offering of $110,000. The presentation assumes the sale of a maximum of 
1,200,000 Shares, that no Shares subject to the Oversubscription Allotment are 
sold, the payment of all pre-opening and organizational costs (other than Bank 
premises and equipment expense) by the Company, and in the case of the maximum 
number of Shares being sold, the contribution of all proceeds in excess of 
$8,000,000 to the Bank. Pre-opening expenses will initially have been funded by 
organizer advances, which will be repaid from the proceeds of this Offering. 
The presentation assumes the direct payment of all such expenses (other than 
Bank premises and equipment expense) by the Company.

EXTENSION OF THE OFFERING AND INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES 

In accordance with the provisions of the Prospectus, the Company has elected to 
extend the Offering period from the original April 10, 1998 termination date. 
The Offering will expire on Tuesday, June 9, 1998, at 5:00 P.M., eastern time, 
provided, however, that the Company reserves the right to further extend the 
Offering for up to an additional thirty days, to July 9, 1998, in the sole 
discretion of the Board of Directors. 

The Company has also elected to increase the maximum number of Shares subject 
to the Offering, including the Shares subject to the Oversubscription 
Allotment, from 1,380,000 to 1,650,000. If all of the increased number of 
shares are sold, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be $16,500,000. The 
increase in the number of Shares is a result of the substantial level of 
interest in the Offering, and the Company's desire to accommodate as many 
subscribers as possible. As of April 10, 1998, the original Termination Date, 
and as of May 8, 1998, the Company had received acceptable subscriptions for 
$15,057,290 and $15,612,790, respectively. The Company plans to use the 
additional proceeds of the Offering for the same purposes, i.e., capital 
contributions to the Bank, payment of pre-opening and organizational expenses, 
to provide working capital for expansion, to fund lending activities and for 
general corporate purposes (including the investment of all or a portion of the 
working capital funds in interest-bearing certificates of deposit or other 
deposits with the Bank or other types of securities, such as government bonds). 
The Company may engage in non-banking activities permissible for bank holding 
companies, including but not limited to venture capital and mortgage banking 
activities. 

Set forth below is a tabular presentation reflecting the anticipated allocation

Offering of $110,000. The presentation assumes the sale of 1,650,000 Shares, 
the payment of all pre-opening and organizational costs (other than Bank 
premises and equipment expense) by the Company, and the contribution of 
$7,750,000 of the proceeds of the Offering to the Bank. The anticipated 
contribution to the Bank's capital has been increased to reflect anticipated 
increases in the estimated Bank premises expense. Pre-opening expenses will 
initially have been funded by organizer advances, which will be repaid from the 
proceeds of this Offering. The presentation assumes the direct payment of all 
such expenses (other than Bank premises and equipment expense) by the Company.

full, the Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Principal 
Stockholder's portion of the 600,000 shares of Common Stock subject to the over-

At this time the principal purposes of this Offering are to obtain additional 
capital, to create a public market for the Common Stock, to facilitate future
 access by the Company to public equity markets and to provide increased 
visibility and credibility in the marketplace. The Company intends to use 
approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds of this Offering for capital 
expenditures associated with technology and systems upgrades and expansion of 
the Company's headquarters location. The Company has no specific plan at this 
time for use of the remaining proceeds and expects to use such proceeds for 
working capital and general corporate purposes including the payment of sales 
and marketing expenses, such as payments associated with strategic alliances. 
The Company may, when the opportunity arises, use an unspecified portion of the 
net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products and 
technologies. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the 
Company expects to evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses, products 
or technologies. However, the Company has no present understandings, 
commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition. Pending use 
of the net proceeds for the above purposes, the Company intends to invest such 
funds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. See ""Risk

Also being registered pursuant to this Registration Statement are approximately 
595,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of certain 
outstanding warrants, which warrants have an exercise price of $1.00 per share, 
150,000 shares of Common Stock underlying the Representative's Warrant, having 
an exercise price of $7.425 per share (that being 135% of the initial public 
offering price per share), and 199,748 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the 
conversion of a promissory note. The aggregate proceeds which could be derived 
from the exercise of all of the above described warrants and the conversion of 
the promissory note are approximately $2,000,000. If received by the Company, 
such funds would be applied to general working capital and the reduction of any 
secured debt. 

(1) The Company currently has outstanding approximately $7,298,000 of 
indebtedness (excluding $740,000 of shareholder loans and notes payable). 
Approximately $4,034,000 of such indebtedness will be repaid from the proceeds 
of the Offering as follows: (i) $964,000 for repayment of the 10% convertible 
secured notes issued between February and April 1997 (the ""February 1997 
Notes""); (ii) $880,000 for repayment of the 12% secured notes issued between 
February and June 1996 (the ""February 1996 Notes""); (iii) $975,000 for 
repayment of the 10% convertible secured notes issued between June and October 
1996 (the ""June 1996 Notes""); (iv) $250,000 for repayment of indebtedness owed 
to Joseph Cayre, a shareholder of the Company; and (v) $965,000 for the 
repayment of $245,000 in principal and fees from a secured note issued in 
March, and $720,000 of principal, interest and fees from a 12% secured note 
issued in April of 1998. The February 1997 Notes, the February 1996 Notes and 
the June 1996 Notes are referred to herein as the ""Bridge Notes."" The maturity 
date on the February 1996 Notes has been extended until the earlier of July 15, 
1998 or the completion of an initial public offering. The balance of Company 
indebtedness (or approximately $3,869,900) matures between July 15, 1998 and 
January 10, 2000, although it is anticipated that a portion of such 
indebtedness will be repaid from and replaced with the proceeds of the Proposed 
Bank Facility. The $3,869,900 is comprised of: (i) $1,189,900 which is 
technically in default as of July 22, 1998; (ii) $765,000 which is not in 
default, but which is due within the next twelve months; and (iii) $1,915,000 
which is not in default and is not due within the next twelve months. If the 
Proposed Bank Facility is not in place by the closing of the Offering, the 
Company may need to allocate a greater percentage of the proceeds of the 
Offering to repay the debt obligations that would have been repaid by virtue of 
such facility. It is currently anticipated that, approximately $2,700,000 
principal amount of indebtedness will remain outstanding after utilization of 
approximately $1,200,000 of the proceeds of the cash collateralized portion of 
the Proposed Bank Facility to repay approximately $1,200,000 principal amount 
of the Company's indebtedness. As described in footnote (2) to 
""Capitalization,"" the ascribed value of the indebtedness to be repaid from the 
proceeds of the Offering on the Company's financial statements is less than the 
outstanding principal balance of said indebtedness. The foregoing repayment 
schedule assumes conversion of the Conversion Note as well as the waiver of all 
conversion rights by the holders of the Bridge Notes which have convertibility 
rights. See ""Risk Factors -- Additional Capital Requirements; Encumbrance of 
Assets; No Assurance of Future Financings"" and ""Certain Transactions."" The loan 
proceeds which are being repaid through the funds being raised hereby were used 
primarily by the Company for working capital, the acquisition of library 
product and the acquisition of the right to produce television product based on 
the feature film ""Total Recall."" 

(2) Until specific acquisitions are identified, and the borrowing base portion 
of the Proposed Bank Facility is implemented, the Company intends to use up to 
approximately $1,200,000 of this money to provide cash collateral for that 
portion of the Proposed Bank Facility which will be used to repay indebtedness 
after the Offering as indicated in Note 1 above. 
As of July 22, 1998, the Company was in technical default in respect of 
obligations of 44 noteholders aggregating approximately $5,536,300, exclusive 
of interest. The Company believes that it will cure such defaults on or about 
the closing of the Offering through the proceeds of this Offering and the 
Proposed Bank Facility. Prior to the closing of this Offering, the Company and 
the Representative will have received written or oral confirmation from 
substantially all of the holders of the obligations that are in technical 
default that they intend to take no action with respect to such technical 
default. However, the Company and the Representative intend to proceed with the 
Offering whether or not they receive such confirmations. See ""Use of Proceeds,"" 
for a discussion of the amounts of the Company's indebtedness to be paid from 
the proceeds of the Offering and the Proposed Bank Facility. 

The Company believes that there are a number of libraries and single or 
multiple television series, movies or special programming owned by unrelated 
third parties of which the Company may be able to acquire either ownership of, 
or long-term distribution rights to. At this date, the Company has not entered 
into any discussions with respect to any such acquisition with any such third 
party. 

The Company anticipates that the net proceeds of the Offering, together with 
projected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to permit the Company to 
conduct its operations as currently contemplated for only the next 12 months. 
Such belief is based upon certain assumptions, including assumptions regarding 
the sales of the Company's original programming and anticipated expenditures 
required for the development and production of additional programming, and 
there can be no assurance that such resources will be sufficient for such 
purpose. The Company will be required to raise substantial additional capital 
in the future in order to further expand its production and distribution 
capabilities. There can be no assurances that additional financing will be 
available, or if available, that it will be on acceptable terms. In addition, 
contingencies may arise which may require the Company to obtain additional 
capital prior to such planned expansion. 

The foregoing uses of proceeds are estimates only, and there may be significant 
variations in the use of proceeds due to changes in current economic and 
industry conditions, as well as changes in the Company's business and financial 
condition. The amount and timing of expenditures will vary depending on a 
number of factors, including changes in the Company's contemplated operations 
and industry conditions. In addition, to the extent that favorable acquisition 
opportunities present themselves, both with respect to the acquisition of 
product or entities in allied fields, the use of proceeds contemplated 
hereunder may be varied significantly. 

These contingencies could also include a changing environment for the 
production of syndicated television series and a deterioration in the 
anticipated pricing structure with respect to the sales of the Company's 
product in certain foreign territories. Alternative uses of the proceeds could 
include increasing development of Company-owned product, increasing the number 
of co-productions with other entities, and financing movies of the week or new 
television series, to the extent that the budgets for such programing are not 
otherwise covered by distribution commitments. 

Pending use of the proceeds from the Offering as set forth above, the Company 
intends to invest all or a portion of such proceeds in short-term certificates
 of deposit, U.S. government obligations, money market investments and short-
term investment grade securities."

capital for Towne Services. The Citizens Loan matures on September 3, 1998,

purchase of assets and liabilities from Credit Collection Solutions, Inc. on

Towne Services intends to use the balance of the net proceeds, expected to be 
approximately $16.4 million, for working capital and general corporate 
purposes, including possible acquisitions. Towne Services continues to evaluate 
potential strategic acquisitions of providers of complementary technologies and 
services and plans to carry on discussions with potential acquisition 
candidates. Other than the acquisition of assets from Credit Collection 
Solutions, the Company is not currently a party to any written agreements or 
commitments with respect to any such acquisitions. There can be no assurance 
that any acquisitions will be consummated on terms favorable to the Company, if 
at all. Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, Towne 
Services intends to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing

offered hereby are estimated to be $28.0 million, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Company expects
 to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock to repay
 the $5.0 million of Subordinated Notes plus accrued interest. The Subordinated
 Notes were issued on April 2, 1998 in a private placement transaction, bear 
interest at 10% per annum in 1998 and 15% per annum thereafter, mature on March
 31, 2001, and are required to be repaid upon the Company's initial public 
offering. The net proceeds from the sale of the Subordinated Notes are being used 
for general working capital purposes, including the purchase of additional 
portfolios of consumer Receivables aggregating $3.2 million through June 30, 
1998. In connection with the issuance of the Subordinated Notes, the Company
 issued the Warrants. The remaining net proceeds of the Offering will be used 
primarily to acquire Receivables. Net proceeds may also be used for working 
capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Pending such use,
 it is anticipated that the Company will invest the net proceeds in short-term,
 investment grade marketable securities."

Stock offered hereby, based upon the initial public offering price of $9.00 per 
share, are estimated to be $13.8 million ($16 million if the Underwriters' over-
allotment option for an additional 270,000 shares is exercised in full) after 
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the Offering. Of 
the net proceeds, $6.4 million will be used to pay the cash portion of the 
purchase price for the Acquisitions. In addition, approximately $760,000 will 
be used to repay indebtedness with maturities of less than one year with a 
weighted average interest rate of approximately 10.1%. The remainder of the net 
proceeds, approximately $6.5 million or 47.1% ($8.7 million or 54.4% if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be used for 
working capital and general corporate purposes, including possible use in 
additional acquisitions of dealerships and for expansion of the livery sales 
and factory authorized free-standing neighborhood service center businesses. 
Pending application for these purposes, approximately $6.5 million ($8.7 
million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the 
net proceeds will be used to pay down a portion of the Company's ""floor plan"" 
indebtedness (i.e., revolving credit arrangements to finance inventory 
purchases). The Company, from time to time, may draw down funds under its floor 
plan financing arrangements with respect to its unencumbered vehicle inventory 
as needed for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 

As of March 31, 1998, the Company had aggregate liability of $28,437,000 under 
its floor plan financing lines of credit, including liability of its 
subsidiaries, Muller Chevrolet, Muller Toyota and Westwood in the amounts of 
$4,148,000, $4,268,000 and $7,493,000, respectively. The floor plan liabilities 
of these subsidiaries are guaranteed by affiliates of the Company as follows: 
Muller Chevrolet by William Muller Sr. and William Muller Jr; Muller Toyota by 
William Muller Sr., William Muller Jr. and James Christ; and Westwood by 
Salvatore A. Vergopia. Hometown plans to reduce its floor plan obligations by 
$6,500,000 using a portion of the proceeds of the Offering, of which an 
estimated $3,600,000 will be used to reduce liabilities guaranteed by these 
affiliates. To the extent that floor plan finance obligations guaranteed by 
affiliates are reduced or eliminated through the use of a portion of the 
proceeds of the Offering, these affililates will benefit through the reduction 
of contingent liability on their guarantees. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The Company intends to pursue acquisitions in the future which will be financed 
with cash, Class A Common Stock or a combination of both cash and Class A 
Common Stock. Although the Company has identified and has held preliminary 
discussions with several potential acquisition candidates, no discussions have 
resulted in definitive agreements or understandings or otherwise reached the 
stage where it is probable that any such acquisition will occur. See

The Secured Notes consist of five separate series of secured notes with 
interest rates ranging from 8.82% to 12.10% per annum. Each series requires the 
payment of annual installments of principal. The Secured Notes have due dates 
ranging from January 31, 1999 to July 1, 2004. The Senior Notes consist of 
seven separate series of senior notes with interest rates ranging from 
8.04% to 12.10% per annum. Each series requires the payment of annual 
installments of principal. The Senior Notes have due dates ranging from May 15, 
1999 to September 28, 2007. The Subordinated Notes consist of one series of 
notes due April 30, 2000. The Subordinated Notes bear interest at the rate of 
9.30% per annum plus contingent interest based on the operating income of EPCO. 
The Company is required to pay a ""make-whole amount"" to the holders of the 
Secured Notes and the Senior Notes if the Company elects to redeem such debt 
prior to its maturity. The ""make-whole amounts"" are based on an implied return 
to maturity for early redemption. 

The Loan Participations consist of interests in the bank debt of Mont Belvieu 
Associates and BEF. The Company will acquire a 60% participation interest in 
the Mont Belvieu Associates loan. This loan had an outstanding principal amount 
as of July 1, 1998 of $12.8 million, requires payment of monthly installments 
of principal and interest, bears interest at a floating rate per annum of LIBOR

for a description of the long-term and short-term bank financing to be prepaid. 
(2) A portion of such funds may be used in connection with acquisitions of 
wholesalers of alcohol beverages in Poland and an importer of wine and to add 
other alcoholic beverage brands. 
Although the Company currently has no agreements or understandings to affect 
any business combination, it does intend to actively seek and investigate such 
opportunities as they become available. Because of the variability and number 
of factors that will determine the Company's use of proceeds from this 
Offering, the Company's management will retain a significant amount of 
discretion over the application of the net proceeds. Pending such uses, the net 
proceeds will be invested in investment grade, interest-bearing securities. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Offering based on the current status of its business. 
Future events, including changes in competitive conditions, the ability of the 
Company to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, the availability of 
other financing and funds generated from operations and the status of the 
Company's business from time to time, may make changes in the allocation of the 
net proceeds of this Offering necessary or desirable. If, for example, 
attractive acquisitions were to become available on terms favorable to the 
Company, funds may be used for those purposes and the construction of the 
warehouse facility delayed or even canceled in favor of leasing another 
facility."

be determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated 
that the net proceeds from the sale of the Conversion Shares will be between 
$112.2 million and $152.3 million ($175.4 million assuming an increase in the 
Estimated Offering Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Unaudited Financial Information"" 
and ""The Offerings - Stock Pricing and Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the 
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. 

The Company will purchase all of the capital stock of the Bank to be issued in 
the Conversion in exchange for 50% of the Conversion proceeds (net of Conversion
-related expenses and the loan to be made to the Company's ESOP), and the Company 
will retain the remaining net proceeds. The Company intends to use a portion of 
the net proceeds to make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to 
purchase up to 8% of the Conversion Shares sold in the Conversion. Based upon 
the issuance of 11,475,000 Conversion Shares and 15,525,000 Conversion Shares 
at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated Offering Range, respectively, 
the loan to the ESOP would be $9.2 million and $12.4 million, respectively.

proceeds retained by the Company initially may be used to invest in U.S. 
Government and federal agency securities of various maturities, mortgage-backed,
mortgage-related or other securities, deposits in either the Bank or other 
financial institutions, or a combination thereof. The portion of the net proceeds 
retained by the Company may ultimately be used to support the Bank's lending 
activities, to repay borrowings in the ordinary course (including certain 
short-term borrowings utilized by the Bank in anticipation of receipt of the 
net proceeds of the offerings--
See ""Summary of Recent Development of Citizens Financial""),
 to support the future expansion of operations through the establishment 
of additional banking offices or other customer facilities or through 
acquisitions of other financial institutions or branch offices 
(although, other than the Merger, no such transactions are specifically being 
considered at this time), and for other business and investment purposes, 
including the payment of regular or special cash dividends, possible 
repurchases of the Common Stock or returns of capital (the Company and the 
Bank have committed not to take any action to further the payment of any 
return of capital on the Common Stock during the one-year period subsequent to 
consummation of the Conversion, and the Company and the Bank do not intend to 
take any actions in the future which would prevent the Merger from being 
accounted for as a pooling of interests under GAAP). Management of the Company
may consider expanding or diversifying, should such opportunities become 
available. Other than the Merger, neither the Bank nor the Company has any 
specific plans, arrangements, or understandings regarding any acquisitions 
or diversification of activities at this time. 
Following the six-month anniversary of the completion of the Conversion
 (to the extent permitted by the OTS), and based upon then existing facts and
 circumstances, the Company's Board of Directors may determine to repurchase
 some shares of Common Stock, subject to any applicable statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Such facts and circumstances may include but not be
 limited to (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the 
stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of 
other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved 
in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per 
share of the remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in the Company's 
return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having 
to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund 
employee stock benefit plans; (iii) the preservation of pooling-of-interests 
treatment of the Merger under GAAP; and (iv) any other circumstances in which
repurchases would be in the best interestsof the Company and its stockholders. 
In order to preserve pooling-of-interests accounting treatment of the Merger 
under GAAP, the Company's ability to repurchase shares of its Common Stock 
will be limited during the two-year period following consummation of the 
Merger. Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the 
Company's Board of Directors that the Bank will be capitalized in excess 
of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. The 
payment of dividends or repurchase of stock, however, would be prohibited 
if the Bank's net worth would be reduced below the amount required for the 
liquidation account to be established for the benefit of Eligible Account 
Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders. As of December 31, 1997, 
the initial balance of the liquidation account would be approximately $65.7 
million. See ""Dividend Policy,"" ""The Conversion and the Merger - Liquidation 
Rights"" and ""The Conversion and the Merger - Certain Restrictions on Purchase 
or Transfer of Shares After the Conversion and the Merger."" 

The Company will be a unitary savings and loan holding company which, under 
existing laws, would generally not be restricted as to the types of business 
activities in which it may engage, provided that the Bank continues to be a 
qualified thrift lender (""QTL""). See ""Regulation - Regulation of Savings and 
Loan Holding Companies"" for a description of certain regulations applicable 
to the Company. 
The portion of the net proceeds used by the Company to purchase the capital 
stock of the Bank will be added to the Bank's general funds to be used for 
general corporate purposes, including increased lending activities and 
purchases of securities. While the amount of net proceeds received by the Bank 
will further strengthen the Bank's capital position, which already substantially
exceeds all regulatory requirements, it should be noted that the Bank is not 
converting primarily to raise capital. After the Conversion and the Merger, 
the Bank's tangible capital ratio will be approximately 11.7% (based upon the 
maximum of the Estimated Offering Range). As a result, the Bank will be a 
well-capitalized institution. After the Conversion and the Merger, the Bank 
intends to emphasize capital strength and growth in assets and earnings. 

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the Conversion may be 
more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the 
number of shares to be issued in the Conversion is adjusted to reflect a 
change in the estimated pro forma market value of the Bank. Payments for 
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at the Bank 
will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by the Bank but 
will result in a reduction of the Bank's interest expense and liabilities 
as funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or other deposit 
accounts."

million ($66.8 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised 
in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and 
expenses of the offering payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the 
net proceeds of the offering as follows: (i) approximately $28.0 million to 
fund the equity-financed portion of the acquisition and installation of gas-
fired generating plants by the Company over the next 18 months and to fund the 
acquisition of additional information technology and related equipment to 
service the Company's expanding customer base; (ii) approximately $13.3 million 
to repay certain outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) the remainder for working 
capital and general corporate purposes, including increased working capital 
requirements associated with the projected expansion of the Company's 
operations and possible strategic acquisitions. 

Of the $13.3 million of outstanding indebtedness that the Company intends to 
repay with a portion of the proceeds of the offering, (i) $6.7 million ((Pounds)
4.0 million) is outstanding under a line of credit with Barclays Bank plc 
(""Barclays"") due March 31, 1999, which bears interest at a base rate plus 
1.75% per annum (9.25% at June 30, 1998), (ii) $4.2 million ((Pounds)2.5 
million) is outstanding under an overdraft facility with Barclays due March 17,
 1999, which bears interest at a base rate plus 1.5% per annum (9.0% at June 30,
 1998) and (iii) $2.4 million ((Pounds)1.4 million) is outstanding under 
promissory notes, which mature December 31, 2002 and bear interest at 10% per 
annum, payable quarterly. 

Although the Company is actively pursuing the acquisition and installation of 
the generating plants described above, there can be no assurance regarding the 
amount and timing of expenditures for such generating plants or that such 
expenditures will not vary materially from those currently contemplated. The 
actual amount to be expended for the acquisition and installation of gas-fired 
generating plants will depend on a number of factors, including market 
conditions in the U.K electricity industry and the Company's success in 
attracting new customers. 

Pending application of the net proceeds from the offering, the Company intends 
to maintain the net proceeds in interest-bearing bank accounts or invest the 
proceeds in short-term, investment grade securities."

 to use approximately $4.0 million of the net proceeds to repay the expected 
outstanding balance on the Company's revolving working capital line of credit 
(the ""Line of Credit"") with Bank of America NT & SA dba Seafirst Bank 
(""Seafirst Bank""). As of March 29, 1998, the outstanding principal on the Line 
of Credit was $615,000. The Line of Credit bears interest at Seafirst Bank's

approximately $4.0 million of the net proceeds to purchase equipment and store 
fixtures for new stores and approximately $1.0 million to upgrade computer

(1) The Company anticipates that it will hire additional sales personnel to 
concentrate on business development in the states of New York and New Jersey. 
The Company will aggressively evaluate and develop markets which have a high 
concentration of corporate clients and catering opportunities. 

(2) The Company believes there are significant opportunities to expand its 
business through the acquisition of existing companies in the contract food 
service industry. Any acquisition will be evaluated by management on its 
individual merits with consideration being given to annual revenues, market 
niche, geographic location and sales price and terms required by the 
acquisition candidate. Approximately $100,000 will be used to evaluate 
acquisition candidates; however, the Company is not currently evaluating any 
possible acquisitions and has no current agreements or understandings with 
respect to the acquisition of any company and is not currently conducting 
negotiations with respect to any acquisition. The Company will actively 
consider acquisition opportunities as they arise. The balance of any funds not 
used for acquisitions or to date unallocated, will be used for working capital. 

(3) The Company has developed a unique concept of home meal replacement which 
can be added to its existing and future client facilities. The HOMEfood MARKET 
offers a variety of meals which can be purchased on the customer's premises for 
consumption after the employee returns home. The Company will use a portion of 
the proceeds to develop additional menu selections and purchase the necessary 
equipment which includes promotional materials, food carts, signs and sampling 
facilities. See ""THE COMPANY - Business Strategy."" 

(4) The Company anticipates the need for on-site food service managers and 
additional administrative support personnel with the anticipated growth in its 
corporate client base. As operations increase and any food service acquisitions 
are consummated, the Company will hire individuals in the areas of accounting 
and menu support. In addition, working capital will be used to fund new accounts
which require substantial up-front costs for cash registers, merchandising 
materials, vending machines and training of employees. 

The amounts set forth above are estimates developed by management of the Company
of the allocation of net proceeds of the offering based upon the Company's 
current plans and prevailing economic and industry conditions. The Company's 
proposed use of proceeds is subject to changes in general, economic and 
competitive conditions, timing and management discretion, each of which may 
change the amount of proceeds expended for the purposes intended. The proposed 
application of proceeds is also subject to changes in market conditions and 
the Company's financial condition in general. 

While there can be no assurance, the Company believes the net proceeds from 
the offering and internally generated funds will be adequate to satisfy the 
Company's working capital needs for the next twelve months. The Company may 
require additional debt or equity financing in order to finance future internal 
growth or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing on 
acceptable terms will be available to the Company when needed, if at all. 
See ""RISK FACTORS,"" ""THE COMPANY"" and ""MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR 
PLAN OF OPERATION."" 

Pending use of the net proceeds of this Offering, the Company may make temporary 
investments in bank certificates of deposit, interest bearing, insured savings 
accounts, United States government obligations and insured money market funds. 
Any income derived from these short-term investments will be used for working 
capital."

$1.4 million, at interest rates of 7.75% to 8.1%, due at various dates. The 
Company also intends to use approximately $10 million of the net proceeds to 
redeem all outstanding shares of its Senior Preferred Stock. Initially, the 
Company intends to use the balance of the net proceeds to pay down a portion 
of GSV's revolving credit facility, which, as of March 31, 1998, had $18.3 
million in outstanding balances thereunder. The remainder of the proceeds of 
this offering, if any, and the Company's renewed borrowing capacity are 
expected to be used for capital expenditures, working capital and other general 
corporate purposes. Specifically, the Company recently authorized capital 
expenditures of up to $20 million, primarily to upgrade, maintain and expand 
its existing winemaking facilities in Fresno and Monterey. The cost, timing and 
amount of any additional funds required by the Company cannot be precisely 
determined at this time and will be based upon numerous factors. The Board of 
Directors has broad discretion in determining how the proceeds of the offering 
will be applied. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest the net 
proceeds of the offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing 
obligations. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares 
of Class B Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders.

daily; $3,000,000 outstanding under the Company's promissory note to Petra

outstanding under the Company's line of credit from Laura M. Stealey, which 
terminates January 1, 1999 and bears interest at 10% per annum; and $371,404 
and $111,421 of the amounts owed to J.W. Stealey and Robert L. Pickens, 
respectively, for accrued interest on prior loans that were converted into 
capital stock in 1998. The Company used the proceeds of the Petra promissory 
note and the Oberlin promissory note to fund inventory and receivables, advance
royalties and certain product development and other infrastructure expenses. 
See ""Certain Transactions."" 

(2) Includes approximately $1,800,000 for investments in external development 
to provide the Company with future products and $2,000,000 for the growth of 
internal research and development efforts, including the hiring of additional 
developers to fill out the Company's product teams, and the purchases of 
computer hardware and software to accommodate the Company's anticipated growth 
in research and development. See ""Business -- Product Development."" 

(3) Includes approximately $2,100,000 for marketing and promotions, the hiring 
of additional marketing staff and the expansion of the Company's infrastructure
for online delivery in Europe, in connection with the Company's expansion of 
its international operations, and $400,000 for the satisfaction of the Company's
obligations under its marketing agreement with General Capital, an affiliate of 
Vertical, a principal shareholder of the Company. See ""Business -- Distribution""
and "" -- Marketing,"" ""Principal Shareholders"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 

(4) The Company intends to use these funds as necessary in the ordinary course 
of the Company's business, including for increased inventories and receivables 
associated with increased revenues and for the continued growth of the Company. 
In addition, the Company may use portions of these proceeds to acquire 
businesses which the Company believes are compatible with its business strategy;
however, while the Company regularly evaluates possible acquisition 
opportunities, as of the date of this Prospectus, the Company has no agreements,
commitments, understandings or arrangements with respect to any particular 
acquisition and there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be 
consummated. See ""Business -- Strategy."" 

If the Representatives exercise their over-allotment option in full, the 
Company will realize additional net proceeds of approximately $2,901,600. Such 
proceeds, if received, are expected to be used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. Pending their uses as set forth above, the Company intends 
to use the net proceeds of this offering either to make short-term reductions 
in the Company's working capital lines of credit or to invest in short-term, 
investment grade, interest-bearing securities. 

The allocation of the net proceeds set forth above represents the Company's 
best estimates based on its proposed plans and assumptions relating to its 
operations and growth strategy and on general economic conditions. The amounts 
actually expended for the above purposes may vary significantly, however, 
depending upon numerous factors, including development and promotional expenses 
related to the introduction of new products, the progress and timing of its new 
product development efforts, changes in technology and the availability of 
desirable acquisition opportunities. The Company believes that the proceeds 
of this offering, together with anticipated revenues from operations, 
availability under the Company's bank lines of credit, and cash and cash 
equivalents, will be sufficient to satisfy its contemplated cash requirements 
for at least 12 months following the consummation of this offering. In the 
event that the Company's plans change (due to changes in market conditions, 
competitive factors or new opportunities that may become available in the 
future), its assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or if the proceeds
of this offering or cash flows prove to be insufficient to implement its 
business plans (due to unanticipated expenses, technical difficulities or 
otherwise), the Company could, however, be required to seek additional 
financing prior to such time. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of 
this offering will be sufficient to permit the Company to implement its business 
plans, that any assumptions relating to the implementation of such plans will 
prove to be accurate or that any additional financing would be available to the 
Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all."

primary purposes of this offering are to increase the Company's equity capital,

 time to time the Company expects to evaluate the acquisition of products, 
technologies and businesses, including the potential acquisition of certain 
international distributors, that complement the Company's business, for which a 
portion of the net proceeds may be used. Currently, however, the Company does 
not have any understandings, commitments or agreements to use any of the net

deducting the underwriting discount and expenses payable by the Company. 
Of these net proceeds, the Company intends to use approximately $8.0 million 
to capitalize each of the Additional Banks, in each case upon receipt of final 
regulatory approvals. 

Any remaining balance of the net proceeds from the Offering will be available 
for general corporate purposes aimed primarily at the expansion of the Company's
business. While the Company does not intend actively to search for opportunities
to expand into additional markets, it may consider opportunities that arise from
time to time, which could occur through acquisitions of existing institutions or
branches. The Company has no specific acquisition plans at the current time 
other than the Additional Banks. See ""Business -- Growth Strategy."" 

Pending the capitalization of the Additional Banks, the Company will lend all 
or part of the net proceeds of the Offering to Cardinal Bank, which will invest 
such funds in short or medium-term interest-bearing securities or loans, 
including loans that are originated by loan production offices in the market 
areas of the Additional Banks. As and when the Company requires funds to 
capitalize an Additional Bank, Cardinal Bank will repay to the Company proceeds 
of this Offering previously loaned by the Company to Cardinal Bank. 

If one or more of the Additional Banks do not receive the necessary regulatory 
approvals, the Company will devote the proceeds of this Offering to support 
the growth of Cardinal Bank and such of the Additional Banks that receive the 
necessary approvals and open for business. The Company anticipates that such 
growth would be achieved through branching. Additionally, if the organization 
of one or more of the Additional Banks is not completed, the Company may devote 
part of the proceeds of this Offering to the acquisition of a controlling 
interest in one or more existing banks. The Company has not identified any 
existing bank that it would seek to acquire or merge with in such event."

estimated to range from $11.43 million to $15,63 million, or up to $18.04 
million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%. See ""PRO FORMA 
DATA"" for the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Holding Company 
has received conditional Federal Reserve approval to purchase all of the 
capital stock of the Savings Bank to be issued in the Conversion and 
Reorganization in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the Conversion 
Offerings. This will result in the Holding Company retaining approximately 
$5.72 million to $7.82 million of net proceeds, or up to $9.02 million if the 
Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%. See ""PRO FORMA DATA."" 

Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the Conversion Shares will 
increase the Savings Bank's capital and will support the expansion of the 
Savings Bank's existing business activities. The Savings Bank will use the 
funds contributed to it for general corporate purposes, including, initially, 
lending and investment in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. 

In connection with the Conversion and Reorganization, the Holding Company 
intends to loan the ESOP the amount necessary to refinance the ESOP's existing 
third party loan used to purchase shares of Savings Bank Common Stock in the 
MHC Reorganization ($295,000 outstanding balance at December 31, 1997) and to 
purchase 8% of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Conversion Offerings 
($6.05 million at the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range). The Holding 
Company's loan to fund the ESOP's purchase of shares of Common Stock in the 
Conversion Offerings may range from $925,000 to $1.28 million based on the 
sale of 95,200 Conversion Shares to the ESOP (at the minimum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range) and 128,800 Conversion Shares (at the maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range), respectively, at the Purchase Price. If 15% above the maximum 
of the Estimated Valuation Range, or 1,851,500 Conversion Shares, are sold in 
the Conversion and Reorganization, the Holding Company's loan to the ESOP would 
be approximately $1.48 million (based on the sale of 148,120 Conversion Shares 
to the ESOP). The principal amount of the ESOP loan will be larger if the ESOP 
is unable to purchase shares in the Conversion and Reorganization and instead 
purchases shares in the open market at prices above the Purchase Price. It is 
anticipated that the ESOP loan will have a ten-year term with interest payable 
at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the closing date 
of the Conversion and Reorganization. The loan will be repaid principally from 
the Savings Bank's contributions to the ESOP and from any dividends paid on 
shares of Common Stock held by the ESOP. 

The net proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially will be invested 
primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations or in a deposit 
account either at the Savings Bank or another financial institution. Such 
proceeds will be available for additional contributions to the Savings Bank in 
the form of debt or equity, to support future diversification or acquisition 
activities, as a source of dividends to the shareholders of the Holding Company 
and for future repurchases of Common Stock to the extent permitted under 
Pennsylvania law and federal regulations. The Holding Company will consider 
exploring opportunities to use such funds to expand operations through 
acquiring or establishing additional branch offices or acquiring other 
financial institutions. Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements,
 agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding any diversification 
activities. 

Following consummation of the Conversion and Reorganization, the Holding 
Company's Board of Directors will have the authority to adopt plans for 
repurchases of Common Stock, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Facts and circumstances upon which the Holding Company's Board of Directors may 
determine to repurchase stock in the future would include but are not limited 
to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the Common Stock 
is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other 
investment alternatives, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings
 per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the ability to improve the 
Holding Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
shareholders by not issuing additional shares to cover the exercise of stock 
options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the 
Holding Company and its shareholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject to 
a determination by the Holding Company's Board of Directors that both the 
Holding Company and the Savings Bank will be capitalized in excess of all 
applicable regulatory requirements and tax and other regulatory considerations.

HiFi Buys Note matures on June 1, 2000 and bears interest at a rate of 9.5%. 
The Company has received a commitment letter from BankBoston, N.A., as agent

Savings Bank's capital ratio to 10%) to purchase all of the capital stock we 
will issue in connection with the conversion. See footnote 1 to ""Historical and 
Pro Forma Capital Compliance."" A portion of the net proceeds to be retained by 
Carnegie Financial Corporation will be loaned to our employee stock plan to 
fund its purchase of 8% of the shares sold in the conversion. On a short-term 
basis, the balance of the net proceeds retained by Carnegie Financial 
Corporation initially will be invested in short-term investments. Although 
there are no current plans, the net proceeds subsequently may be used to fund 
acquisitions of other financial services institutions or to diversify into 
non-banking activities. The net proceeds may also serve as a source of funds 
for the payment of dividends to stockholders or for the repurchase of the 
shares. A portion of the net proceeds may also be used to fund the purchase of 
4% of the shares for the RSP which is anticipated to be adopted following the 
conversion. See ""Pro Forma Data."" 

The funds we receive from the sale of our capital stock to CFC will be added to 
our general funds and be used for general corporate purposes including: 
(i) investment in mortgages and other loans, (ii) investment in U.S. Government 
and federal agency securities, (iii) investment in mortgage-backed securities 
or 
(iv) funding loan commitments. However, initially we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in short-term investments until we can deploy the proceeds into higher 
yielding assets. The funds added to our capital will further strengthen our 
capital position. 

The net proceeds may vary because the total expenses of the conversion may be 
significantly more or less than those estimated. We estimate that our expenses 
will be approximately $260,000 and our estimated net proceeds will range from 
$1,270,000 to $1,810,000 (or up to $2,121,000 in the event the maximum of the 
estimated valuation range is increased to $2,380,500). See ""Pro Forma Data."" 
The net proceeds will also vary if the number of shares to be issued in the 
conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in our estimated pro forma market 
value. Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit 
accounts with us will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by 
us but will result in a reduction of our liabilities and interest expense as 
funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or accounts for use in 
purchasing stock."

$65.6 million and $89.0 million ($102.4 million assuming an increase in the 
Offering Price Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" as to the assumptions used 
to arrive at such amounts. 

The Company plans to contribute to the Bank 50% of the net proceeds from the 
Offerings and retain the remainder of the net proceeds. The Company anticipates 
that after the loan to the ESOP and after contributing 50% of the funds raised 
in the Conversion and Reorganization to the Bank, it will have approximately 
$38.6 million (based upon the sale of 9,034,834 shares of Common Stock) which 
it intends to loan to the Bank. The Bank will invest these funds, initially in 
short interest-bearing deposits and short and intermediate term securities. 
The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to make a loan directly
to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8.0% of the Conversion Stock. Based 
upon the issuance of 6,677,927 shares and 9,034,834 shares of Conversion Stock 
at the minimum and maximum of the Offering Price Range, respectively, the loan 
to the ESOP would be $5.3 million and $7.2 million, respectively. It is 
anticipated that the loan to the ESOP will have a term of not less than 15 years
and a fixed rate of interest at the prime rate as of the date of the loan. See 
""MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK - Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" The net proceeds 
retained by the Company also may be used to support the future expansion of 
operations or diversification into other banking-related businesses and for 
other business or investment purposes, including the acquisition of other 
financial institutions and/or branch offices, although there are no current 
plans, arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding such expansion, 
diversification or acquisitions. The Bank does, however, continually evaluate 
additional branching opportunities that will complement existing operations or 
support expansion into growth markets. No assurance can be given, however, that 
such expansion will occur during 1998. In addition, subject to applicable 
regulatory limitations, the net proceeds also may be used to repurchase shares 
of Common Stock. See ""THE CONVERSION AND REORGANIZATION - Certain Restrictions 
on Purchase or Transfer of Shares after the Conversion and Reorganization."" 
The portion of the net proceeds contributed to the Bank will be used for general
corporate purposes, primarily investment in residential real estate loans and 
will be initially used to invest primarily in short-term interest-bearing 
deposits and marketable securities. 

In addition, a portion of the proceeds may be used to fund open market purchases
of Common Stock for the Recognition Plan if such plan is approved by stockholders. 
The estimated cost of such plans is dependent upon the price paid for the shares
in the open market. If Common Stock equal to 4% at the maximum of the Offering 
Range, or 361,393 shares, was purchased for the Recognition Plan at $10 per 
share, the cost would be $3.6 million. See ""MANAGEMENT OF ROXBOROUGH-MANAYUNK

The net proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares may vary depending upon 
financial and market conditions at the time of the completion of the Offering. 
See ""THE CONVERSION - Pricing and Number of Common Shares to be Sold."" 
The expenses detailed above are estimated. Actual expenses may be more than or 
less than estimated. See ""THE CONVERSION Plan of Distribution."" 

The Holding Company will retain approximately $152.7 million, or 46%, of the 
net proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares at the adjusted maximum of the 
Adjusted Valuation Range. Such proceeds will be used to make a loan to the ESOP 
to acquire 8% of the total Common Shares sold in the Offering and contributed 
to the Foundation. Based upon the issuance of 33,465,625 shares at the adjusted 
maximum of the Adjusted Valuation Range, the loan to the ESOP would be $26.8 
million. See ""MANAGEMENT - Stock Benefit Plans -- Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" 
The loan to the ESOP will have a term of up to 15 years and an interest rate 
equal to the Prime Rate less 1/2%, currently 8.0%. The balance of the net 
proceeds may be invested initially in investment securities, mortgage-backed 
securities, U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various maturities,
deposits in either the Company or other financial institutions, or a combination
thereof. 

Ultimately, the proceeds retained by the Holding Company may be used for general
corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions of other financial institutions, 
other financial services companies or other businesses which a savings and loan 
holding company is permitted to own, the payment of dividends, a tax-free return
of capital, repurchases of Common Shares and funding of the RRP. The Holding 
Company and the Company, however, will not take any action that would further 
the payment of a tax-free return of capital to the Holding Company shareholders 
during the first year following the completion of the Conversion. 

The Holding Company currently has no specific plan to repurchase any of the 
Common Shares. In the future, the Board of Directors of the Holding Company 
will make decisions on the repurchase of the Common Shares based on its view 
of the appropriateness of the price of the Common Shares as well as the Holding 
Company's and the Company's investment opportunities and capital needs. OTS 
regulations generally prohibit the Holding Company from repurchasing any of its 
capital stock for three years following the date of completion of the Conversion, 
except as part of an open-market stock repurchase program during the second and 
third years following the Conversion involving no more than 5% of the 
outstanding capital stock during a twelve-month period. The OTS may permit a 
repurchase during the first year following the completion of the Conversion or 
may permit the Holding Company to exceed the 5% limits in the second and third 
years if exceptional circumstances are established. In addition, after any 
repurchase during the three years following the completion of the Conversion, 
the Company's regulatory capital must equal or exceed all regulatory capital 
requirements. See ""THE CONVERSION - Restrictions on Repurchase of Common Shares."" 

The remainder of the net proceeds received from the sale of the Common Shares,
approximately $177.7 million, or 54%, at the adjusted maximum of the Adjusted 
Valuation Range, will be invested by the Holding Company in the capital stock 
to be issued by the Company to the Holding Company. The resulting increase in 
the regulatory capital of the Company will permit the Company to expand its 
lending and investment activities and to enhance customer services. The Company 
anticipates that the portion of the net proceeds received by the Company will 
initially be invested in overnight funds and short-term investments with 
maturities of up to three years and eventually utilized for general corporate 
purposes, including increased loan origination activity and a modest increase 
in investments in corporate notes and U.S. Government and federal agency 
securities. During the next three years, the Company intends to concentrate on 
increasing its consumer and commercial loan portfolios, but during the first 
year following the Conversion, the Company anticipates an increase in 
construction and one- to four-family loans. The Company may also use the 
Conversion proceeds for the expansion of its facilities, and, although no such 
transactions are specifically being considered at this time, to expand 
operations through acquisitions of other financial institutions, branch offices
or other financial services companies or the establishment of de novo branch 
offices or loan origination facilities."
BCSB BANKCORP INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/bcsb-bankcorp-inc-9287-4518,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/bcsb-bankcorp-inc-9287-4518,424B3,5/21/1998,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=558850,"The amount of proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock in the Offering will 
depend upon the total number of shares actually sold in the Subscription 
Offering and the Community Offering and the Syndicated Community Offering, 
if any, and the actual expenses of the Reorganization and Stock Issuance. 
As a result, the actual net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock cannot 
be determined until the Reorganization and Stock Issuance are completed. 
Based on the sale of $17.3 million of Common Stock at the midpoint of the 
Estimated Valuation Range, the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock 
are estimated to be approximately $16.6 million. The Company has received 
regulatory approval from the OTS to purchase all of the capital stock of the 
Bank to be issued in the Stock Issuance in exchange for at least 50% of the net
proceeds. Based on the foregoing assumption and the purchase of 8% of the shares
to be issued in the Offering by the ESOP, the Bank would receive approximately 
$8.2 million in cash, and the Company would retain approximately $6.8 million 
in cash and $1.4 million in the form of a note receivable from the ESOP. The 
ESOP note receivable will be for a ten year term and carry an interest rate, 
which adjusts annually, equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal. 

The proceeds retained by the Company, after funding the ESOP, initially will be 
invested in short-term and intermediate-term securities including cash and cash
equivalents and U.S. government and agency obligations. Such proceeds will be 
available for a variety of corporate purposes, including funding the MRP, if 
implemented, future acquisitions and diversification of business, additional 
capital contributions, dividends to stockholders and future repurchases of the 
Common Stock to the extent permitted by applicable regulations. The Company 
currently has no specific plans, intentions, arrangements or understandings 
regarding acquisitions, diversification of business, additional capital 
contributions or repurchases of Common Stock. Due to the limited nature of the 
Company's business activities, the Company believes that the net proceeds 
retained after the Stock Issuance, earnings on such proceeds and payments on 
the ESOP note receivable will be adequate to meet the Company's financial needs 
until dividends are paid by the Bank; however, no assurance can be given that the 
Company will not have a need for additional funds in the future. For additional 
information, see ""Regulation -- Depository Institution Regulation -- Dividend 
Limitations."" 

The proceeds contributed to the Bank will ultimately become part of the Bank's 
general corporate funds to be used for its business activities, including making
loans and investments. Initially, it is expected that the proceeds will be 
invested in short-term and intermediate-term securities including cash and cash 
equivalents and U.S. government and agency obligations. The Bank ultimately plans 
to use such proceeds primarily to originate loans in the ordinary course of 
business. In addition, the Bank will use a portion of the net proceeds, 
currently estimated to be $500,000 to modernize the Bank's facilities, including
installing new ATMs and upgrading its computer systems. Further, the Bank 
currently is negotiating to lease land in Harford County on which it will build 
a new branch. The Bank may use a portion of the net proceeds to pay for all costs 
including construction costs, which are estimated to be $750,000. 

In addition to the new branch office for which a lease currently is under 
negotiation, although there are no specific plans as of the date of this 
Prospectus, in the future the Bank desires to open several new branch offices 
in its market area and to possibly relocate an existing branch office. The Bank's 
experience has been that construction and other costs for a new or relocated 
branch office generally amount to between $500,000 and $750,000 and that annual 
lease and other operating expenses for a new branch office would be expected to 
be between approximately $150,000 and $200,000 annually."

general corporate purposes over such 12 month period and thereafter. The Company
may also use a portion of the net proceeds, together with the Company's current 
cash balances, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash generated from 
collaborative arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products or 
technologies that are complementary to those of the Company. The amounts 
actually expended for each purpose and the timing of such expenditures may vary
significantly depending upon numerous factors, including the results of 
clinical trials and preclinical testing, the achievement of milestones under 
collaborative arrangements, the ability of the Company to maintain existing and 
establish additional collaborative arrangements, the timing and outcome of 
regulatory actions regarding the Company's potential products, the costs and 
timing of expansion of marketing, sales and manufacturing activities, the costs 
involved in preparing, filing, protecting, maintaining and enforcing patent 
claims and other intellectual property rights and competing technological and 
market developments. Pending the foregoing uses, the Company intends to invest 
the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment

The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this Offering as follows: 
(i) approximately $4.0 million for capital expenditures, including construction 
of the Company's new preclinical laboratory facility, and (ii) the remaining

activities and continuing assessment of the commercial potential of the Company's

Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the common stock will 
increase the Association's capital and will support the expansion of the 
Association's existing business activities. The Association will use the funds 
contributed to it for general corporate purposes, including, initially, lending 
and investment in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. Depending 
on loan demand, the Association may consider using a portion of the conversion 
proceeds for investment in mortgage-backed securities. 

The remaining net proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially will be 
invested primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. Such 
proceeds will be available for additional contributions to the Association in 
the form of debt or equity, to support future diversification activities, as a 
source of dividends to the stockholders of the Holding Company and for future 
repurchases of common stock to the extent permitted under Indiana law and 
federal regulations. 

The use of proceeds may be subject to change depending on the demand for loans 
in the Association's market area, the prevailing interest rate environment and 
the Association's interest rate risk position. 

Following consummation of the conversion, the Board of Directors will have the 
authority to adopt plans for repurchases of common stock, subject to statutory 
and regulatory requirements. Since the Holding Company has not yet issued stock, 
there currently is insufficient information upon which an intention to 
repurchase stock could be based. The facts and circumstances upon which the 
Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future would 
include but are not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the 
price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the 
attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return 
and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value 
and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the ability 
to improve the Holding Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of 
dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the 
exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) 
any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of 
the Holding Company and its stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject 
to a determination by the Board of Directors that both the Holding Company and 
the Association will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory 
requirements after any such repurchases and that capital will be adequate, 
taking into account, among other things, the Association's level of 
nonperforming and classified assets, the Holding Company's and the 
Association's current and projected results of operations and asset/liability 
structure, the economic environment and tax and other regulatory considerations.

approximately $138.8 million (approximately $159.7 million if the U.S. 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses payable by 
the Company. The net proceeds to the Company from the Debt Offering are 
estimated to be approximately $193.5 million, after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses payable by the Company. 
The closing of the Debt Offering is conditioned upon the closing of the Equity 
Offering, but the closing of the Equity Offering is not conditioned upon the 
closing of the Debt Offering. There can be no assurance that the Debt Offering 
will be consummated. 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offerings, together with 
the remaining proceeds from the Equity Contributions and the Unit Offering and 
funding expected to be available under the Vendor Financing, to fund the costs 
of deploying networks in all 24 Phase I and Phase II markets and the operation 
of those networks to Positive Free Cash Flow, including the costs to develop, 
acquire and integrate the necessary OSS and other back office systems. 
In addition, at the closing of the Debt Offering, the Company will use 
approximately $68.9 million of the net proceeds from the Debt Offering to 
purchase the pledged securities, consisting of U.S. government securities (the 
""Pledged Securities""), pursuant to a collateral pledge and security agreement 
(the ""Pledge Agreement"") made by the Company in favor of The Bank of New York 
(the ""Trustee""). The Pledged Securities will be pledged to the Trustee as 
security for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and will be used to fund 
the first six scheduled payments of interest on the Notes. See ""Description of 
Certain Indebtedness."" The precise amount of proceeds to be used to purchase 
Pledged Securities will depend on the interest rates on U.S. government 
securities prevailing on the closing date of the Debt Offering. The Trustee will 
hold the Pledged Securities pursuant to the Pledge Agreement pending 
disbursement. If the Company consummates the Equity Offering but not the Debt 
Offering or the Vendor Financing, the Company intends to modify its deployment 
schedule by developing only five to seven Phase II markets. If the Company 
consummates both the Equity and Debt Offerings, but the Vendor Financing is 
not obtained, the Company intends to modify its deployment schedule by 
developing only eight to ten Phase II markets. In each such case, the Company 
would delay deployment of networks in the remaining Phase II markets until it 
obtains additional financing on acceptable terms and conditions. The Company's 
principal capital expenditure requirements include the purchase and installation 
of digital switches, transmission equipment collocated in ILEC central offices, 
customer premise equipment, and the overbuilding of leased transmission 
facilities as traffic volume growth makes it economically attractive. 

As part of its strategy, the Company may make acquisitions and enter into joint 
ventures, and a portion of the net proceeds from the Offerings may be used for 
such purposes. The Company has no definitive agreement with respect to any 
acquisition or joint venture, although from time to time it has discussions 
with other companies and assesses opportunities on an ongoing basis. The Company
may require additional financing to complete its Phase I and Phase II market 
buildout (or require financing sooner than anticipated) if: (i) the Company's 
development plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate; (ii) the 
Company engages in any acquisitions; (iii) the Vendor Financing is not obtained 
on a timely basis or at all; or (iv) the Company alters the schedule or targets 
of its roll-out plan or, in the event the Debt Offering is not consummated, the
Company accelerates the implementation of its network deployment in the 
remaining Phase II markets. There can be no assurance that such additional 
financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. See

Requirements; Uncertainty of Additional Financing"" and ""Management's Discussion

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
such net proceeds will be between $109.1 million and $148.0 million (or up to 
$170.3 million in the event of an increase in the aggregate pro forma market 
value of the Common Stock of up to 15% above the maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion - Stock Pricing"" 
and ""--Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at 
such amounts. 

In exchange for all of the common stock of HCSI issued in the Conversion, the 
Holding Company will contribute approximately 50% of the net proceeds from the 
sale of the Holding Company's Common Stock to HCSI. On an interim basis, the 
proceeds will be invested by the Holding Company and HCSI in short-term 
investments similar to those currently in the Bank's portfolio. The specific 
types and amounts of short-term assets will be determined based on market 
conditions at the time of the completion of the Conversion. In addition, the 
Holding Company intends to provide the funding for the ESOP loan. Based upon 
the initial Purchase Price of $10.00 per share, the dollar amount of the ESOP 
loan would range from $9.2 million (based upon the sale of shares at the 
minimum of the Estimated Valuation Range) to $12.4 million (based upon the sale 
of shares at the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range). The interest rate 
to be charged by the Holding Company on the ESOP loan will be based upon the 
prime rate of interest as reported in the Wall Street Journal at the time of 
origination. It is anticipated that the ESOP will repay the loan through 
periodic tax-deductible contributions from the Bank over a fifteen-year period. 

The net proceeds received by HCSI will become part of HCSI's general funds for 
use in its business and will be used to support the Bank's existing operations, 
subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. Immediately upon the completion 
of the Conversion, it is anticipated that the Bank will invest such proceeds 
into short-term assets. Subsequently, the Bank intends to redirect the net 
proceeds to the origination of loans, subject to market conditions. 

After the completion of the Conversion, the Holding Company will redirect the 
net proceeds invested by it in short-term assets into a variety of securities 
similar to those already held by the Bank, as well as in deposit accounts with 
the Bank. Also, the Holding Company may use a portion of the proceeds to fund 
the RRP, subject to shareholder approval of such plan. Compensation expense 
related to the RRP will be recognized as share awards vest. See ""Pro Forma Data.
"" Following stockholder ratification of the RRP, the RRP will be funded either 
with shares purchased in the open market or with authorized but unissued shares.
Based upon the initial Purchase Price of $10.00 per share, the amount required 
to fund the RRP through open-market purchases would range from approximately 
$4.6 million (based upon the sale of shares at the minimum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range and including shares issued to the Foundation) to approximately 
$6.2 million (based upon the sale of shares at the maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range). In the event that the per share price of the Common Stock 
increases above the $10.00 per share Purchase Price following completion of the 
Offering, the amount necessary to fund the RRP would also increase. The use of 
authorized but unissued shares to fund the RRP could dilute the holdings of 
stockholders who purchase Common Stock in the Conversion. See ""Business of the 
Bank - Lending Activities"" and "" - Investment Activities"" and ""Management of 
the Bank - Benefit Plans - Employee Stock Ownership Plan"" and ""- Recognition and
Retention Plan."" 

The proceeds may also be utilized by the Holding Company to repurchase (at 
prices which may be above or below the initial offering price) shares of the 
Common Stock through an open market repurchase program subject to applicable 
regulations, although the Holding Company currently has no specific plan to 
repurchase any of its stock. In the future, the Board of Directors of the 
Holding Company will make decisions on the repurchase of the Common Stock based 
on its view of the appropriateness of the price of the Common Stock as well as 
the Holding Company's and the Bank's investment opportunities and capital needs.
 

The Bank may use a portion of the proceeds to fund the creation of one or more 
new branch offices within its primary market area, although the Bank has no 
specific plans regarding any new branch offices at this time. In addition, the 
Holding Company or HCSI might consider expansion through the acquisition of 
other financial services providers (or branches, deposits or assets thereof), 
although there are no specific plans, negotiations or written or oral agreements
regarding any acquisitions at this time."

maximum and 15% above the maximum of the Offering Range, are estimated at $11.2 
million, $13.3 million, $15.3 million and $17.7 million, respectively. 
The Company will be unable to utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offering 
until the consummation of the Reorganization. 

The Company will retain up to 50% of the net proceeds of the Offering. Net 
proceeds retained by the Company will be used to fund the loan to the Bank's 
ESOP to acquire up to 8% of the Common Stock issued in the Offering. Any 
remaining net proceeds retained by the Company will be invested in short-term 
and medium-term investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities, 
Treasury obligations, and deposits of the Bank. The Company will contribute to 
the Bank at least 50% of the net proceeds of the Offering, which will be added 
to the Bank's general funds that management currently intends to use initially 
for general corporate purposes, including investment in one-to-four family 
residential real estate loans and other loans and investment in short-term and 
intermediate-term securities and mortgage-backed securities. 

The net proceeds retained by the Company and proceeds contributed to the Bank 
may also be used to support the future expansion of operations through branch 
acquisitions, the establishment of new branch offices, and the acquisition of 
financial institutions or their assets or diversification into other banking 
related businesses. However, neither the Company nor the Bank has any specific 
plans, arrangements or understandings regarding any additional expansions or 
acquisitions at this time. 

Upon completion of the Reorganization, the Board of Directors of the Company 
will have the authority to repurchase stock, subject to statutory and regulatory
requirements. Based upon facts and circumstances following the Reorganization 
and subject to applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may 
determine to repurchase Common Stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances
may include but will not be limited to (i) market and economic factors such as 
the price at which the Common Stock is trading in the market, the volume of 
trading, the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the 
rate of return and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the 
book value and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and 
the opportunity to improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance 
of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover 
the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and 
(iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders. In the event the Company 
determines to repurchase stock, such repurchases may be made at market prices

discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, are estimated to be 
approximately $58.4 million ($67.4 million if the over-allotment option is 
exercised in full). Of this amount, approximately $4.8 million will be used to 
reduce the outstanding revolving loan balance of $32.6 million at July 27, 1998 
under the Credit Agreement dated as of January 30, 1998, among the Company and 
the lenders named therein (the ""Credit Agreement""); approximately $26.2 million 
as of July 27, 1998 will be used to repay WCAS Capital Partners, III, L.P. 
(""WCAS CP III"") under the terms of a subordinated note (the ""Subordinated Debt"")
in the original principal amount of $25.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest; and approximately $26.2 million as of July 27, 1998 will be paid in 
the Reincorporation in exchange for the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and
all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. 

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the prime rate, the 
federal funds rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), plus, in each 
case, a margin depending upon the Company's ratio of funded debt to EBITDA. 
As of July 27, 1998, the effective interest rate on outstanding balances was 8.2%. 

The Subordinated Debt bears interest at 10.0% per annum. The Subordinated Debt 
was used to finance a portion of the acquisitions of Davenport Medical Center, 
Woodland Park Hospital, Eastmoreland Hospital, and Lander Valley Medical Center.
See ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions -- Subordinated Debt."" 

The Series A Preferred Stock accrues dividends at 7.0% per annum on the sum of 
the liquidation value plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, which was 
approximately $26.2 million as of July 27, 1998. See ""Certain Relationships and 
Related Transactions -- Series A Preferred Stock."" 

The Company intends to use the balance of the proceeds for the Puget Sound 
Acquisition. Pending such use, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds 
of the Offering in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade debt 
securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, time deposits or direct 
or guaranteed obligations of the United States. 

Although the Company has had preliminary discussions from time to time regarding
possible acquisition opportunities, the Company has no agreements, 
understandings or commitments with respect to any such opportunities, other than
as described elsewhere in this Prospectus. There can be no assurance that any 
future acquisition will be consummated."

Although the Company does not have any current plans regarding mergers and 
acquisitions, the Company may use a portion of the net proceeds from this 
Offering for such purposes. 

As of May 31, 1998, the Company owed CHI $693,135, as evidenced by a 10-year 
note executed as of October 31, 1997 in the amount of $763,367, which accrues 
interest at 6.68% per annum. Since May 31, 1998, the Company has not made any 
payments on this note. In December 1995, Mr. Chapman loaned CCM $100,000, 
payable on demand, for the purchase of common stock of an affiliate. In March 
1996, Mr. Chapman loaned CCM an additional $45,000, payable on demand. These 
loans provided for a fixed interest payment of $14,500, or an effective flat 
rate of 10% of the principal. As of May 31, 1998, the Company had made payments 
in the amount of $145,627 and owed Mr. Chapman $13,873 on the indebtedness above. 
The Company shares office space, certain employees and other overhead with 
certain other entities controlled by Mr. Chapman including The Chapman Co. 
and The Chapman Insurance Agency Incorporated, a licensed insurance agency that 
has not engaged in significant operations to date. The Company is generally 
allocated compensation and benefits expense based upon the estimated percentage 
of such employees' time spent performing services for the Company pursuant to 
an expense allocation agreement. The Company is charged for other expenses based
on actual or estimated usage. Pursuant to such expense allocation arrangements 
the Company owed CHI, $28,782 and $106,267 as of December 31, 1997 and as of the
three months ended March 31, 1998, respectively. The Company expects to use part
of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay its indebtedness to CHI and Mr. 
Chapman. Further, to the extent part of the net proceeds of the Offering are 
used for working capital and general corporate purposes, a portion of the net 
proceeds may be used for payments to CHI in connection with shared overhead and 
other expenses. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The above proposed allocation represents the Company's best estimate based upon 
current plans and certain assumptions regarding industry and general economic 
conditions and the Company's future revenue and expenditures. If any of these 
factors change, the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate 
some of the proceeds within the above-described categories, use portions 
thereof for other purposes or seek additional financing. There can be no 
assurance that additional financing will be available to the Company on 
acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to obtain additional financing, if 
required, could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including 
possibly requiring the Company to curtail its operations. Since a portion of 
the net proceeds will be applied to general corporate purposes and working 
capital, the Company will have broad discretion as to the application of such 
net proceeds. See ""Risk Factors--Discretionary Use of Proceeds."" 

The Company intends to invest net proceeds not immediately required for the 
purposes described above, principally in The Chapman U.S. Treasury Money Fund 
or directly in United States' government or municipal securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, other money market funds or the Company's bank account."

Although the Company does not have any current plans regarding mergers and 
acquisitions, the Company may use a portion of the net proceeds from this 
Offering for such purposes. 

As of May 31, 1998, the Company owed CHI $693,135, as evidenced by a 10-year 
note executed as of October 31, 1997 in the amount of $763,367, which accrues 
interest at 6.68% per annum. Since May 31, 1998, the Company has not made any 
payments on this note. In December 1995, Mr. Chapman loaned CCM $100,000, 
payable on demand, for the purchase of common stock of an affiliate. In March 
1996, Mr. Chapman loaned CCM an additional $45,000, payable on demand. These 
loans provided for a fixed interest payment of $14,500, or an effective flat 
rate of 10% of the principal. As of May 31, 1998, the Company had made payments 
in the amount of $145,627 and owed Mr. Chapman $13,873 on the indebtedness above. 
The Company shares office space, certain employees and other overhead with 
certain other entities controlled by Mr. Chapman including The Chapman Co. 
and The Chapman Insurance Agency Incorporated, a licensed insurance agency that 
has not engaged in significant operations to date. The Company is generally 
allocated compensation and benefits expense based upon the estimated percentage 
of such employees' time spent performing services for the Company pursuant to 
an expense allocation agreement. The Company is charged for other expenses based
on actual or estimated usage. Pursuant to such expense allocation arrangements 
the Company owed CHI, $28,782 and $106,267 as of December 31, 1997 and as of the
three months ended March 31, 1998, respectively. The Company expects to use part
of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay its indebtedness to CHI and Mr. 
Chapman. Further, to the extent part of the net proceeds of the Offering are 
used for working capital and general corporate purposes, a portion of the net 
proceeds may be used for payments to CHI in connection with shared overhead and 
other expenses. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The above proposed allocation represents the Company's best estimate based upon 
current plans and certain assumptions regarding industry and general economic 
conditions and the Company's future revenue and expenditures. If any of these 
factors change, the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate 
some of the proceeds within the above-described categories, use portions 
thereof for other purposes or seek additional financing. There can be no 
assurance that additional financing will be available to the Company on 
acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to obtain additional financing, if 
required, could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including 
possibly requiring the Company to curtail its operations. Since a portion of 
the net proceeds will be applied to general corporate purposes and working 
capital, the Company will have broad discretion as to the application of such 
net proceeds. See ""Risk Factors--Discretionary Use of Proceeds."" 

The Company intends to invest net proceeds not immediately required for the 
purposes described above, principally in The Chapman U.S. Treasury Money Fund 
or directly in United States' government or municipal securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, other money market funds or the Company's bank account."

Although the Company does not have any current plans regarding mergers and 
acquisitions, the Company may use a portion of the net proceeds from this 
Offering for such purposes. 

As of May 31, 1998, the Company owed CHI $693,135, as evidenced by a 10-year 
note executed as of October 31, 1997 in the amount of $763,367, which accrues 
interest at 6.68% per annum. Since May 31, 1998, the Company has not made any 
payments on this note. In December 1995, Mr. Chapman loaned CCM $100,000, 
payable on demand, for the purchase of common stock of an affiliate. In March 
1996, Mr. Chapman loaned CCM an additional $45,000, payable on demand. These 
loans provided for a fixed interest payment of $14,500, or an effective flat 
rate of 10% of the principal. As of May 31, 1998, the Company had made payments 
in the amount of $145,627 and owed Mr. Chapman $13,873 on the indebtedness above. 
The Company shares office space, certain employees and other overhead with 
certain other entities controlled by Mr. Chapman including The Chapman Co. 
and The Chapman Insurance Agency Incorporated, a licensed insurance agency that 
has not engaged in significant operations to date. The Company is generally 
allocated compensation and benefits expense based upon the estimated percentage 
of such employees' time spent performing services for the Company pursuant to 
an expense allocation agreement. The Company is charged for other expenses based
on actual or estimated usage. Pursuant to such expense allocation arrangements 
the Company owed CHI, $28,782 and $106,267 as of December 31, 1997 and as of the
three months ended March 31, 1998, respectively. The Company expects to use part
of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay its indebtedness to CHI and Mr. 
Chapman. Further, to the extent part of the net proceeds of the Offering are 
used for working capital and general corporate purposes, a portion of the net 
proceeds may be used for payments to CHI in connection with shared overhead and 
other expenses. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The above proposed allocation represents the Company's best estimate based upon 
current plans and certain assumptions regarding industry and general economic 
conditions and the Company's future revenue and expenditures. If any of these 
factors change, the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate 
some of the proceeds within the above-described categories, use portions 
thereof for other purposes or seek additional financing. There can be no 
assurance that additional financing will be available to the Company on 
acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to obtain additional financing, if 
required, could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including 
possibly requiring the Company to curtail its operations. Since a portion of 
the net proceeds will be applied to general corporate purposes and working 
capital, the Company will have broad discretion as to the application of such 
net proceeds. See ""Risk Factors--Discretionary Use of Proceeds."" 

The Company intends to invest net proceeds not immediately required for the 
purposes described above, principally in The Chapman U.S. Treasury Money Fund 
or directly in United States' government or municipal securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, other money market funds or the Company's bank account."

(1) Represents amounts expected to be expended for the development of new 
products and upgrades of existing products. 

(2) Represents repayment of outstanding indebtedness consisting of 
(i) $200,000 of Company indebtedness to various parties, including creditors of 
a predecessor of the Company (See ""Certain Transactions--Transactions With 
Redwood Technology""), and (ii) approximately $1,000,000 of loans incurred in 
connection with a 1998 private placement of debt and warrants, which loans 
bear interest, payable quarterly in arrears, at an annual rate of seven percent
and are due and payable in full on the earlier to occur of three business days 
following the completion of the Offering or May 31, 1999. The proceeds of the 
1998 private placement were used primarily to repay indebtedness of the Company 
and its predecessor, to fund increased sales and marketing efforts, including 
attendance at direct sales industry trade shows, and for general working capital. 

(3) Represents amounts expected to be expended in connection with the expansion 
of the Company's sales and marketing efforts, including an increase in sales 
personnel and marketing budgets for the Company's products. 

(4) The remainder of the net proceeds (approximately $1,302,750 if the 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be used to fund the Company's 
general working capital requirements, including customer support, corporate 
overhead, payroll and other such expenses of the Company. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimates of its application of the 
net proceeds of the Offering based upon present plans and current business 
conditions. The net proceeds from the exercise of the Representatives' Warrants,
if any, will be added to the general funds of the Company and used for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes. Unforseen events, changed 
business conditions and a number of other factors that are beyond the control 
of the Company, could necessitate changes in the application of net proceeds. 
The Company reserves the right to reallocate the net proceeds of the Offering 
among the various uses described above or for such other purposes as it, in its 
sole discretion, deems necessary or desirable. In the event that the Company 
changes the use of proceeds of the Offering, the Company may require immediate 
additional debt or equity financing to meet its business plan. If the need 
should arise, there can be no assurance that any such financing would be 
available on terms that are favorable to the Company, if at all. 

The Company may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, 
products or technologies complementary to the Company's current business. The 
Company has no present commitments or agreements and is not currently involved 
in any negotiations with respect to any such acquisitions. The Company has not 
determined the amounts it plans to expend on each of such uses or the timing of 
such expenditures. The amounts actually expended for each such use, if any, are 
at the discretion of the Company and may vary significantly depending upon a 
number of factors, including future revenue growth and the amount of cash 
generated by the Company's operations. 

Pending their application, the net proceeds of the Offering will be invested 
principally in U.S. government securities, short-term certificates of deposit, 
money market funds or other similar short-term interest bearing investments."

underwriting commission and estimated offering expenses to be paid by the 
Company. 

The net proceeds of the Offering will be used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, including capital contributions to the Bank, the financing 
of acquisitions of banks and businesses closely related to banking and possible 
repayment of borrowings. The Company currently has no plans, understandings, 
arrangements or agreements, written or oral, with respect to any specific 
acquisition prospect, and is not presently negotiating with any party with 
respect thereto. See ""Risk Factors -- No Assurance of Acquisitions."" 

The Company may determine to repay the M&I Loan in whole or in part with the 
Proceeds of this Offering. As of March 31, 1998, the principal amount 
thereunder was approximately $2.7 million. The Company has the option of 
selecting one of the following annual interest rates: (i) Prime Rate; (ii) the 
six-month Treasury Rate plus 1.75% and (iii) LIBOR plus 1.5%. Presently, 
interest payments on the unpaid principal are due quarterly at the six-month 
Treasury Rate plus 1.75%. The remaining unpaid loan balance is due on October 
16, 2000. See ""Business -- Loan from Marshall & Ilsley Bank."" 

After the consummation of this Offering and pending the application of proceeds 
in the manner set forth above, the net proceeds may be invested by the Company 
in short-term interest-bearing securities or certificates of deposits. Although

after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and offering expenses. The 
Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the 
Selling Stockholders. 

The principal purposes of this Offering are to obtain additional capital, repay 
certain existing and expected indebtedness, create a public market for the 
Common Stock, facilitate future access by the Company to public equity markets 
and to provide increased visibility and credibility in a marketplace where many 
of the Company's current and potential competitors are or will be publicly held 
companies. The Company expects to use such proceeds for general corporate 
purposes, including funding of approximately $1.5 million in capital 
expenditures for geographic expansion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999,
the repayment after December 31, 1998 (unless sooner demanded by the lenders as 
described below) of approximately $6.0 million of debt that bears interest at 
the rate of 13.5% per annum and has a maturity date of June 1999, and the 
repayment of approximately $1.5 million of debt that bears interest at the rate 
of 11% per annum and has a maturity date of May 1999. The lenders have the right 
to require the Company to repay the full amount of the $6.0 million of debt 
immediately after the closing of this Offering. The Company expects to use 
approximately $30.5 million of such proceeds for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes, including the funding of operating losses which the 
Company expects to be significant on a quarterly and annual basis for the 
foreseeable future. The Company's management will retain broad discretion in the
allocation of a substantial portion of the net proceeds. Pending use of the net 
proceeds for the above purposes, the Company intends to invest such funds in 
short-term, interest bearing, investment grade securities. See ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--

being offered by the Company hereby at the initial public offering price of 
$14.00 per share are estimated to be approximately $39.5 million (approximately 
$45.8 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), 
after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and offering expenses. The 
Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the 
Selling Stockholders. 

The principal purposes of this Offering are to obtain additional capital, repay 
certain existing and expected indebtedness, create a public market for the 
Common Stock, facilitate future access by the Company to public equity markets 
and to provide increased visibility and credibility in a marketplace where many 
of the Company's current and potential competitors are or will be publicly held 
companies. The Company expects to use such proceeds for general corporate 
purposes, including funding of approximately $1.5 million in capital 
expenditures for geographic expansion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999,
the repayment after December 31, 1998 (unless sooner demanded by the lenders as 
described below) of approximately $6.0 million of debt that bears interest at 
the rate of 13.5% per annum and has a maturity date of June 1999, and the 
repayment of approximately $1.5 million of debt that bears interest at the rate 
of 11% per annum and has a maturity date of May 1999. The lenders have the right 
to require the Company to repay the full amount of the $6.0 million of debt 
immediately after the closing of this Offering. The Company expects to use 
approximately $30.5 million of such proceeds for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes, including the funding of operating losses which the 
Company expects to be significant on a quarterly and annual basis for the 
foreseeable future. The Company's management will retain broad discretion in the
allocation of a substantial portion of the net proceeds. Pending use of the net 
proceeds for the above purposes, the Company intends to invest such funds in 
short-term, interest bearing, investment grade securities. See ""Management's

(1) Construction of leasehold improvements for four new KFC/registered 
trademark/ restaurants. 
(2) Reduction of long term debt due to Banco A. Edwards, a Chilean based bank, 
with maturity dates through 2005. The interest rate for this long term debt 
ranges from 9.02% to 11%, based upon the Asociacion de Bancos y Entidades 
Financieras (T.A.B.) rate, which represents a daily average of the interest 
paid by banks on their deposits. This long term debt was incurred as a result 
of the Company's consolidation of certain of its lines of credit and short term 
debt. See ""Note 9 to Notes to Financial Statements."" 

(3) Includes computers, cooking and grill equipment, furniture and fixtures for 
four new KFC/registered trademark/ restaurants. 

(4) Payment of back royalty fees and accrued interest of 12.5% per annum due to 
KFCIH. 

(5) Includes (i) $415,000 plus accrued interest of 7.8% per annum due to Kyoto, 
the principal shareholder of the Company, in connection with a loan made to KyF 
Chile in November 1997, which was used to reduce the back royalties due to 
KFCIH, and (ii) $150,000 plus accrued interest of 8.5% per annum due to an 
unrelated third party, which is being used to pay a portion of the costs and 
expenses of the Offering. See ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions"" 
and ""Bridge Financing."" 

(6) Includes amounts due to KFCIH for initial fees for four new KFC/registered 
trademark/ restaurants (at $35,000 per restaurant). 

(7) Includes overhead and administrative expenses, legal expenses (not in 
connection with this Offering) and reserves. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Offering, based upon the current status of its operations 
and anticipated business plans. It is possible that the application of funds 
may vary depending on numerous factors including, but not limited to, changes 
in the economic climate or unanticipated complications, delay and expenses. 
The Company currently estimates that the net proceeds from this Offering will 
be sufficient to meet the Company's liquidity and working capital requirements 
for a period of at least 12 months from the completion of this Offering and to 
open four additional new KFC/registered trademark/ restaurants. However, there 
can be no assurance that the net proceeds of this Offering will satisfy the 
Company's requirements for any particular period of time. Additional financing 
may be required to implement the Company's long-term business plan. There can 
be no assurance that any such additional financing will be available when needed
on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Any additional proceeds realized 
from the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option or the Warrants will be used for 
working capital. Pending use of the proceeds of this Offering, the Company may 
make temporary investments in bank certificates of deposit, interest bearing 
savings accounts, prime commercial paper, U.S. Government obligations and money 
market funds. Any income derived from these short term investments will be used 
for working capital. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations."""

$680,150, at the minimum of the Estimated Valuation Range, to $1,010,150, at 
the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range. At the midpoint of the Estimated 
Valuation Range, the estimated net proceeds of the Conversion would be $845,150.

The Commissioner has granted the Holding Company approval to retain 50% of the 
net Conversion proceeds, plus the amount necessary to fund the ESOP. The balance
of the net proceeds will be paid to the Savings Bank in exchange for all of its
capital stock. Assuming that the Conversion is consummated at the midpoint of 
the Estimated Valuation Range, (i) the Savings Bank will receive approximately 
$334,575 or 40% of the net proceeds of the Offering in exchange for all of its 
issued and outstanding capital stock, and (ii) the Holding Company will retain 
approximately $510,575 or 60% of the net proceeds, out of which the Holding 
Company will make a loan to the Savings Bank's ESOP in the amount of $88,000 
(assuming the midpoint of the Estimated Valuation Range). The ESOP will repay 
such loan from the Holding Company with contributions made to the ESOP by the 
Savings Bank and any dividends on the Common Stock held by the ESOP. The loan 
will require annual interest and principal payments over a ten-year period and 
will bear interest at a rate of 8%. 

The Holding Company intends to invest the net proceeds of the Offering which it 
retains in securities of the kind in which the Savings Bank invests. The 
proceeds of the Offering may be used for additional contributions to the Savings
Bank in the form of debt or equity, for possible future acquisitions and 
diversification activities, and for future dividends on, and repurchases of, 
Common Stock, as and if permitted by the Federal Reserve Board, the 
Commissioner and the FDIC. The Holding Company does not currently anticipate any
tax-free return of capital. See ""DIVIDEND POLICY"" and ""THE CONVERSION -- 
Restrictions on Repurchases of Common Stock;"" see also ""RISK FACTORS -- 
Competition."" The Holding Company has no specific plans, arrangements, 
agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions, diversification 
activities, return of capital or repurchases of Common Stock. 

The net proceeds of the Offering which are paid to the Savings Bank will become 
part of the Savings Bank's general funds and will be used for general corporate 
purposes, including the expansion of its deposit base and loan originations and 
investment in securities of the kind in which the Savings Bank currently 
invests."

($11,820,000 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) 
after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. Of these proceeds,
approximately $485,000 will be used to satisfy the contingent payment owed to 
the former WEFG shareholders and the remainder will be used to support the 
continuing expansion of the Bank's business through increased lending and 
investment activities and the opening or purchasing of additional branches. 
The proceeds will also increase the Bank's legal lending limit, permitting the 
Bank to make larger loans. In addition, proceeds may be used by Admiralty to 
acquire other financial institutions or lines of business. Admiralty has 
recently received regulatory approval to open a new office in Boca Raton, 
Florida. This facility is being leased from a limited liability company 
consisting of certain members of the Company's Board of Directors, and provides 
for a 20 year term with a base rent of $143,000 per year. Approximately $750,000
in proceeds will be used for the fit out of this location and to acquire 
furniture, fixtures and equipment for the branch. Other than this Boca Raton 
branch, Admiralty has not entered into any agreements with parties for the 
opening or purchasing of additional branches, and Admiralty has not entered 
into any agreements calling for the acquisitions of any other institutions. 
Although, other than for use in lending operations the Company does not have a 
specific current use for the proceeds of the Offering, management believes the 
Company's potential future growth would be negatively impacted if the Offering 
were not undertaken at this time. With the new management team hired for the 
Bank, the Company anticipates substantial new lending opportunities. Under 
regulatory requirements, the Bank's lending authority per borrower is limited by
the Bank's capital. This capital is measured as of each financial quarter end. 
Management therefor believes that the Bank may lose lending opportunities, and 
related income, potentially available through business relationships of the 
Bank's new management if the Bank does not currently increase its capital. 
In addition, as the Florida banking market continues to consolidate, management 
believes opportunities to acquire new branch locations, and possibly entire 
institutions, will arise. If the Bank does not have sufficient capital, it will 
not be able to take advantage of these opportunities."

Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately $57.4 
million (approximately $66.2 million if the over-allotment option is exercised 
in full), after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses. The primary purposes of this offering are to obtain additional 
capital, create a public market for the Common Stock and facilitate future 
access to public markets. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the 
sale of the Common Stock by the Selling Stockholder. 

The Company intends to use at least $6.0 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering for capital expenditures prior to the end of 1999 and to use a portion
of the net proceeds to repay all outstanding indebtedness under a bank credit 
line ($431,000 at June 30, 1998). This credit line matures on January 5, 2000 
and bears interest at the bank's prime rate plus 1.25% (9.75% at June 30, 1998).
The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds, over time, for 
general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Company may also use 
a portion of the net proceeds, currently intended for general corporate 
purposes, to acquire or invest in businesses, technologies, products or services
that are complementary to the Company's business. The Company has no present 
plans or commitments and is not currently engaged in any negotiations with 
respect to such transactions that are material. Pending such uses, the Company 
intends to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest-
bearing, investment-grade securities. The Company will have significant 
discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from this offering. See ""Risk 
Factors--Future Capital Needs"" and ""--Broad Management Discretion Over

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds from the offering based upon the current state of the Company's 
business operations, its current plans and current economic conditions. Based 
on the Company's current proposed plans and assumptions relating to the 
implementation of the Company's business strategy, the Company anticipates that
 the net proceeds from the offering, together with projected cash flow from 
operations, will be sufficient to satisfy contemplated cash requirements for at 
least 12 months following the consummation of the offering. Future events, 
including the problems, delays, expenses and complications frequently 
encountered by software companies as well as changes in regulatory, political 
and competitive conditions affecting the Company's business and the success or 
lack thereof of the Company's business strategy, may necessitate shifts in the 
allocation of funds. The Company also reserves the right to allocate the net 
proceeds for acquisitions, although the Company does not have any present 
understandings, commitments or arrangements with respect to an acquisition. 
Pending use of the proceeds of the offering, the Company may invest such funds 
in interest bearing accounts, certificates of deposit, money market funds or 
similar short-term investments."
FIRST NILES FINANCIAL INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/first-niles-financial-inc-9882-4969,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/first-niles-financial-inc-9882-4969,424B3,9/24/1998,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=412907,"The actual net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock cannot be determined 
until the Conversion is completed. It is presently anticipated, however, that 
such net proceeds will be between $16.3 million and $22.3 million (or up to 
$25.7 million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased up to the adjusted 
maximum). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion - Stock Pricing and Number 
of Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. 

The Company will contribute approximately 50% of the net proceeds received from 
the sale of its Common Stock in exchange for all of the common stock of Home 
Federal issued in the Conversion. The proceeds we receive from the Company in 
exchange for the common stock of Home Federal will become part of our general 
funds for use in our business and will be used to support the Association's 
existing operations. We anticipate initially investing all such proceeds into 
short-term assets similar to those currently in the Association's portfolio. 
Thereafter, we intend to invest the net proceeds (approximately $11.2 million 
at the maximum of the EVR) in the origination of loans, primarily one- to four-
family and consumer loans, and the purchase of investment and mortgage-backed 
and related securities, subject to market conditions. See ""Risk Factors--
Weakness in Local Economy"" and ""--Limited Potential for Asset, Loan and Deposit 
Growth."" We may use the proceeds to establish or acquire additional branch 
offices or engage in acquisitions, when and if the opportunity arises, or for 
investment purposes, including, but not limited to the modernization of our 
office facility. Currently, we have no plans or understandings regarding any 
acquisitions or expansion, or modernization of our office facility. There are 
no current plans as to the specific allocation of the proceeds, however, one of 
the principal purposes for the Conversion is to structure the Association in 
the stock form used in the United States by all commercial banks, most major 
business corporations and most savings institutions. See ""First Niles Financial,
Inc."" 

Furthermore, the Company intends to lend a portion of the net proceeds to the 
ESOP to fund the ESOP's purchase of 8% of the Common Stock. Based upon the 
initial purchase price of $10.00 per share, the dollar amount of the ESOP loan 
would range from $1.4 million to $1.8 million (or up to $2.1 million based upon 
the sale of shares at the adjusted maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range). 
The interest rate to be charged by the Company on the ESOP loan will be based 
upon the IRS prescribed applicable federal rate at the time of origination. 
It is anticipated that the ESOP will repay the loan through periodic tax-
deductible contributions from the Association over a twelve-year period. 

The remainder of the net proceeds will be retained by the Company 
(approximately $9.3 million at the maximum of the EVR). The Company anticipates 
that initially the remaining proceeds will be invested in short-term investments
similar to those currently in the Association's portfolio. These funds would be 
available for general corporate purposes which may include expansion of 
operations through acquisitions of other financial service organizations and 
diversification into other related or unrelated businesses, or for investment 
purposes. See ""Regulation - Holding Company Regulation"" for a discussion of OTS 
activity restrictions. Currently, there are no specific plans being considered 
for the expansion of the business of the Company. In addition, the funds may be 
used to infuse additional capital into the Association when and if appropriate. 
There are no current plans as to the specific allocation of the proceeds. 

The Company also may use a portion of the proceeds to fund a restricted stock 
plan, subject to shareholder approval of such plan. Compensation expense related
to the restricted stock plan will be recognized as share awards vest. See ""Pro 
Forma Data."" Following shareholder ratification of the restricted stock plan, 
such plan will be funded either with shares purchased in the open market or with
authorized but unissued shares. Based upon the initial purchase price of $10.00 
per share, the amount required to fund the restricted stock plan through open-
market purchases would range from $680,000 to $920,000 (or up to $1.1 million 
based upon the sale of shares at the adjusted maximum of the Estimated Valuation
Range). In the event that the per share price of the Common Stock increases 
above the initial $10.00 per share purchase price following completion of the 
offering, the amount necessary to fund the restricted stock plan would also 
increase. The use of authorized but unissued shares to fund the restricted stock
plan could dilute the holdings of shareholders who purchase the Common Stock. 
See ""Management of the Association -- Benefit Plans -- Other Stock Benefit 
Plans."" 

The Board of Directors of the Company may use the net proceeds received in the 
Conversion to repurchase (at prices which may be above or below the initial 
offering price) shares of Common Stock, subject to regulatory restrictions. 
Under current OTS regulations, no repurchases may be made within the first year 
following Conversion except with OTS approval. During the second and third years
following Conversion, OTS regulations permit, subject to certain limitations, 
the repurchase of up to five percent of the outstanding shares of stock during 
each twelve-month period with a greater amount permitted with OTS approval. The 
OTS regulations generally do not restrict repurchases after the third year 
following the Conversion; however, after the Conversion, the principal source 
of funds for the Company will be dividends from the Association. OTS regulations
do place limits on the Association's ability to pay dividends to the Company. 
For a description of these restrictions, see ""Dividends"" and ""The Conversion - 
Restrictions on Repurchase of Stock."" 

The Company will make decisions relating to the repurchase of the Common Stock
based on its view of the appropriateness of the repurchase price of the Common 
as well as the Company's and the Association's investment opportunities, capital
needs, current and projected results of operations and asset/liability 
structure, the economic environment and tax and other regulatory considerations.
Other facts and circumstances that may influence the Company's decision to 
repurchase shares of Common Stock in the future include but are not limited to
(i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and the effect on the Company's return on equity;
(ii) the avoidance of dilution to shareholders by not having to issue additional
 shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit
plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the 
best interests of the Company and its shareholders. A stock repurchase program 
may have the effect of: (a) reducing the overall market value of the Company; 
(b) increasing the overall cost of capital; (c) promoting a temporary demand for
Common Stock; and (d) increasing the percentage of shares outstanding held by 
shareholders, including management. The Company currently has no specific plan 
to repurchase any of its stock. 

Home Federal also has several business purposes for the Conversion. The 
Conversion will structure the Association in the stock form used in the United 
States by all commercial banks, most major business corporations and most 
savings institutions. In addition, our Board of Directors believes that a 
holding company structure can facilitate the diversification of our business 
activities. While diversification will be maximized if a unitary holding company
 structure is utilized because the types of business activities permitted to a 
unitary holding company are broader than those of a multiple holding company, 
either type of holding company may engage in a broader range of activities than 
may a thrift institution directly. Currently, there are no plans that the 
Company engage in any material activities apart from holding the shares of the 
Association although the Board may determine to expand the Company's activities 
after Conversion. See ""First Niles Financial, Inc."""

deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions payable by the Company, are
approximately $4,228 million. The Company will use the net proceeds of the 
Offerings, plus a portion of its cash and cash equivalents, to repay or purchase
a portion of the indebtedness owed by certain subsidiaries of the Company to 
DuPont under certain intercompany notes (the ""Intercompany Notes""). The 
Intercompany Notes will consist of (i) a promissory note in the principal amount
of $7.5 billion, due January 2, 2000, and bearing interest at a rate of 6.0125 
percent per annum, (ii) a promissory note in the principal amount of 
approximately $827 million, due January 2, 2000, and bearing interest at a rate 
equal to the six-month LIBOR plus 0.375 percent per annum (or 5.965 percent per 
annum in the current period), (iii) several Norwegian Kroner denominated 
promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $447 
million after conversion to U.S. dollars at June 30, 1998, having various 
maturity dates (ranging from October 1998 to January 2000 and having a remaining
weighted average maturity of 11 months as of June 30, 1998), and bearing 
interest at a rate equal to the six-month NIBOR plus 0.375 percent per annum 
(or 5.565 percent per annum in the current period) and (iv) a promissory note 
(which, depending on the balance on October 31, 1998 of net borrowings from 
DuPont, at the completion of the Offerings is expected to be, and will be 
capped at, $240 million in principal amount), due on demand, and bearing an 
interest rate during any calendar month based on the interest rate on DuPont's 
commercial paper during the preceding month (or 5.65% in October 1998). 

The net proceeds of the Offerings will be applied, first, to pay accrued 
interest on the $7.5 billion promissory note and then to pay principal on such 
promissory note to the extent necessary to reduce the principal amount to $4.846 
billion; second, to purchase the Kroner denominated notes described in clause 
(iii) of the preceding paragraph and pay accrued interest thereon; third, to 
repay, in whole or in part, the $827 million note referred to in clause 
(ii) of the preceding paragraph and pay accrued interest thereon; and fourth,
to repay, in whole or in part, the note referred to in clause (iv) of the 
preceding paragraph. To the extent the net proceeds of the Offerings, together 
with the Company's cash and cash equivalents in excess of $225 million 
(excluding $70 million of additional monetary assets held by the Company's 
captive insurance company and its subsidiaries and excluding any cash and cash 
equivalents held by Petrozuata) at the end of the month following completion of 
the Offerings, are insufficient to repay or purchase in full the notes referred 
to in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the preceding paragraph, the holders of 
such notes will contribute the remaining balance of the notes to the Company 
(provided that a portion of the notes referred to in clauses (ii) and (iv) of 
the preceding paragraph may remain outstanding in lieu of all or part of the 
promissory note in the principal amount of approximately $7 million described 
in ""Arrangements Between the Company and DuPont -- Intercompany Notes."") The 
$7.5 billion promissory note was incurred in payment of a dividend in July 1998.
The promissory note with a principal amount of approximately $827 million was 
incurred to finance the purchase by the Company of certain loans made by DuPont 
to the Company. The purchased loans, as well as the several promissory notes 
with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $447 million, were incurred 
to finance certain capital expenditures, acquisitions and working capital. The 
promissory note referred to in clause (iv) of the preceding paragraph was 
incurred to finance working capital needs of the Company. 

Following the application of the net proceeds from the Offerings and the 
utilization of a portion of the Company's cash and cash equivalents in 
connection with the matters discussed in ""Arrangements Between the Company and 
DuPont -- Intercompany Notes,"" the Company (excluding Petrozuata) will have 
approximately $225 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding $70 million 
of additional monetary assets held by the Company's captive insurance company 
and its subsidiaries) at the end of the month in which the Offerings occur."

The Stock Company will contribute 50% of the net proceeds of the Offering to 
the Bank. The net proceeds received by the Bank from the Stock Company will be 
added to the Bank's general funds which the Bank currently intends to use for 
general corporate purposes, including investments in short- and medium-term 
investment grade debt securities and marketable equity securities. Depending on 
market conditions, the Bank also intends to use such funds to increase its 
origination of mortgage, consumer and commercial business loans. The Bank may 
also use such funds to establish new branch offices and ATM locations, and to 
expand operations through acquisitions of other financial institutions, branch 
offices or other financial services companies. However, the Stock Company and 
the Bank have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements regrading 
any such transactions. To the extent that the stock-based benefit programs which
the Stock Company intends to adopt subsequent to the Offering are not funded 
with authorized-but-unissued shares of common stock, the Stock Company or the 
Bank may use net proceeds from the Offering to fund the purchase of stock to be 
awarded under such stock benefit programs. See ""Risk Factors--Possible Dilutive 
Effect of Issuance of Additional Shares"" and ""Management of the Bank--
Compensation of Officers and Trustees through Benefit Plans--Stock Option Plan"" 
and ""--Recognition and Retention Plan."" 

The Stock Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains to 
make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase in the Offering,
or in the open market to the extent common stock is not available to fill the 
ESOP's subscription, 8% of the shares sold in the Offering. The amount of the 
ESOP loan may be increased to the extent ESOP shares are not available at the 
$10 per share offering price. See ""Management of the Bank--Compensation of 
Officers and Trustees through Benefit Plans--Employee Stock Ownership Plan and 
Trust."" The Stock Company and the Bank may alternatively choose to fund the 
ESOP's stock purchase through a loan by a third party financial institution. 
The remaining net proceeds retained by the Stock Company will be invested 
initially in short- and medium-term investments. 

Upon completion of the Offering, the Board of Directors of the Stock Company 
will have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory 
and regulatory requirements. The FDIC may prohibit the holding company of a 
state-chartered savings bank which has converted from the mutual to stock form 
of ownership from repurchasing its capital stock within one year following the 
date of its conversion to stock form, except that stock repurchases of no 
greater than 5% of outstanding capital stock may be made during this one-year 
period where compelling and valid business reasons are established to the 
satisfaction of the FDIC. The regulations of the Division also restrict stock 
repurchases by mutual holding company subsidiaries within three years of a stock
issuance unless the repurchase (i) is part of a pro rata offer made to all 
stockholders and approved by the Division, (ii) is limited to the repurchase of 
qualifying shares of a director, (iii) is made in the open market by an employee
stock benefit plan; or (iv) is limited to 5% of the outstanding capital stock of
the subsidiary savings bank or subsidiary holding company and the Division is 
satisfied that valid and compelling business reasons exist for the repurchase. 

Based upon facts and circumstances following the Offering and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but not
be limited to: (i) market and financial factors such as the price at which the 
stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of 
other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved 
in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per 
share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to improve the 
Stock Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or the purchase of shares by the ESOP in the event the ESOP is 
unable to acquire shares in the Offering, or to fund the Stock Plans; and 
(iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best 
interests of the Stock Company and its shareholders. In the event the Stock 
Company determines to repurchase stock, such repurchases may be made at market 
prices which may be in excess of the purchase price in the Offering. Any stock 
repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of Directors that 
both the Stock Company and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all 
applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that such 
capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, the level of 
non-performing and other risk assets, the Stock Company's and the Bank's current
and projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic 
environment, tax and other considerations. See ""The Offering and the

(1) In calculating estimated net proceeds, it has been assumed that no sales 
will be made through selected dealers. 
(2) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares which 
could occur due to an increase in the Offering Range of up to 15% to reflect 
changes in market or financial conditions following the commencement of the 
Subscription Offering and the Community Offering, if any, as well as to reflect 
the demand for the Common Stock. 

The actual net proceeds may differ from the estimated net proceeds calculated 
above for various reasons, including variances in the actual amount of legal and
accounting expenses incurred in connection with the Reorganization and Offering,
commissions paid for sales made through other dealers, and the actual number of 
shares of Common Stock sold in the Offering. Any variance in the actual net 
proceeds from the estimates provided in the table above is not expected to be

WEST ESSEX BANCORP INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/west-essex-bancorp-inc-8776-5350,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/west-essex-bancorp-inc-8776-5350,424B3,8/21/1998,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1471428,"Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock cannot be 
determined until the Offering is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $14.5 million
and $19.9 million (or $22.9 million if the Offering Range is increased by 15%). 
See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Reorganization and Stock Offering--Stock Pricing 
and Number of Shares Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such 
amounts. Bancorp will be unable to utilize any of the net proceeds of the 
Offerings until the consummation of the Reorganization. 

Bancorp will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank to be 
issued upon Reorganization in exchange for that portion of the net proceeds of 
the Offering sufficient to increase the Bank's tangible capital to 10% of its 
adjusted total assets, with the remaining net proceeds to be retained by 
Bancorp. Based on the midpoint of the Offering Range, Bancorp expects to utilize
$12.8 million of net proceeds to purchase the common stock of the Bank. Such 
portion of net proceeds will be added to the Bank's general funds which the Bank
currently intends to utilize for general corporate purposes, including 
investments in loans, mortgage-backed and investment securities, the possible 
repayment of FHLB borrowings under appropriate market conditions, and the 
funding of stock-based benefit plans. The Bank may also use such funds for the 
expansion of its facilities, and to expand operations through acquisitions of 
other financial institutions, branch offices or other financial services 
companies. The Bank has not yet determined the approximate amount of net 
proceeds to be used for any of the purposes mentioned above. 

Bancorp intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to make a loan directly to 
the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of the Common Stock issued in the 
Offering, including shares issued to the Foundation. Bancorp and the Bank may 
alternatively choose to fund the ESOP's stock purchases through a loan by a 
third-party financial institution. The remaining net proceeds retained by 
Bancorp will initially be invested in mortgage-related securities and federal 
agency obligations. Based upon the sale of 1,531,445 shares or 2,071,955 shares 
at the minimum and maximum of the Offering Range, and the issuance of shares to 
the Foundation, the amount of the loan to the ESOP (assuming a per share price 
of $10.00) would be $1.3 million or $1.7 million, respectively (or $2.0 million 
if the Offering Range is increased by 15%) to be repaid over a 10-year period 
at the prevailing prime rate of interest, which currently is 8.5%. See 
""Management of the Bank -- Other Benefit Plans--Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" 

The net proceeds retained by Bancorp may also be used to support the future 
expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment of branch
offices and the acquisition of other financial institutions or their assets, 
including those located within the Bank's market area or diversification into 
other banking related businesses. Bancorp has no current arrangements, 
understandings or agreements regarding any such opportunities or transactions. 
The OTS requires that neither Bancorp nor the Bank may take any action to 
further the payment of a return of capital dividend for one year following the 
Reorganization. There can be no assurance that any such action would occur 
following one year after consummation of the Reorganization. 

Upon completion of the Reorganization and Offering, the Board of Directors of 
Bancorp will have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to 
statutory and regulatory requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, Bancorp, 
pursuant to OTS regulations, will be prohibited from repurchasing any shares of 
the Common Stock for three years except: (i) for an offer to all stockholders 
on a pro rata basis (except that the Mutual Company may be excluded from the 
repurchase without the OTS' approval); or (ii) for the repurchase of qualifying 
shares of a director. 


Based upon facts and circumstances following Reorganization and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but 
are not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which 
the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness 
of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk 
involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or 
earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to 
improve Bancorp's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of Bancorp 
and its shareholders. Although Bancorp has no current plans to repurchase its 
stock, in the event Bancorp does determine to repurchase stock, such repurchases
may be made at market prices which may be in excess of the Purchase Price in the
Offering. 

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of 
Directors that both Bancorp and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all 
applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that such 
capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, the level of 
non-performing and other risk assets, Bancorp's and the Bank's current and 
projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic 
environment, tax and other considerations. See ""The Reorganization and Stock 
Offering--Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Common Stock."""

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $1.7 million 
and $2.4 million ($2.8 million assuming an increase in the Estimated Valuation 
Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion -- Stock Pricing and 
Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such 
amounts. 

The Company will purchase all of the capital stock of the Association to be 
issued in the Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net Conversion proceeds, 
and the Company will retain the remaining 50% of the net proceeds. The Company 
intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to make a loan directly to the 
ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase up to 8% of the Common Stock. Based upon 
the issuance of 204,000 shares or 276,000 shares at the minimum and maximum of 
the Estimated Valuation Range, respectively, the loan to the ESOP would be 
$163,200 and $220,800, respectively. See ""Management -- New Stock Benefit Plans 
-- Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" The remaining net proceeds retained by the 
Company initially may be used to invest in mortgage-backed securities issued by 
U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, U.S. Government 
and federal agency securities of various maturities, deposits in either the 
Association or other financial institutions, or a combination thereof. The 
portion of the net proceeds retained by the Company may ultimately be used to 
support the Association's lending activities, to support the future expansion 
of operations through establishment of branch offices or other customer 
facilities, expansion into other lending markets or diversification into other 
banking related businesses (although no such transactions are specifically 
being considered at this time), and for other business and investment purposes, 
including the payment of regular or special cash dividends, possible 
repurchases of the Common Stock or returns of capital. Neither the Association 
nor the Company has any specific plans, arrangements, or understandings 
regarding any branch acquisitions or diversification of activities at this time.

Applicable OTS conversion regulations require the Company to sell Common Stock 
in the Conversion in an amount equal to its estimated pro forma market value, 
as determined by an independent appraisal. See ""The Conversion -- Stock Pricing 
and Number of Shares to be Issued."" As a result, the Company may be required to 
sell more shares in the Conversion than it may otherwise desire. To the extent 
the Company has excess capital upon completion of the Conversion, the Company 
intends to consider stock repurchases, dividends and returns of capital to the 
extent permitted by the OTS and deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. 
The Company and the Association have committed to the OTS that they will not 
take any action toward paying a tax-free return of capital during the one-year 
period following consummation of the Conversion. 

Stock repurchases will be considered by the Company's Board of Directors 
following the completion of the Conversion based upon then existing facts and 
circumstances, as well as applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Such facts and circumstances may include but not be limited to (i) market and 
economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in the market, 
the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in 
terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment, the ability to 
increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding 
shares, and an improvement in the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance
 of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover 
the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii)
 any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of 
the Company and its stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject to the 
determination of the Company's Board of Directors that the Association will be 
capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such 
repurchases. The payment of dividends or repurchase of stock, however, would be 
prohibited if the Association's net worth would be reduced below the amount 
required for the liquidation account to be established for the benefit of 
Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders. As of the 
date of this Prospectus, the initial balance of the liquidation account would 
be approximately $1.7 million. See ""Dividend Policy,"" ""The Conversion -- 
Liquidation Rights"" and ""-- Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of 
Shares After the Conversion."" 
The Company will be a unitary savings and loan holding company which, under 
existing laws, would generally not be restricted as to the types of business 
activities in which it may engage, provided that the Association continues to 
be a qualified thrift lender (""QTL""). See ""Regulation -- The Company"" for a 
description of certain regulations applicable to the Company. However, the 
types of businesses in which the Company may engage may be restricted if 
pending legislation is adopted. See ""Risk Factors -- Regulatory Oversight and 
Legislation."" 

The portion of the net proceeds used by the Company to purchase the capital 
stock of the Association will be added to the Association's general funds to be 
used for general corporate purposes, including increased lending activities and 
purchases of investment and mortgage-backed securities. While the amount of net 
proceeds received by the Association will further strengthen the Association's 
capital position, which already exceeds all regulatory requirements, it should 
be noted that the Association is not converting primarily to raise capital. 
After the Conversion, the Association's tangible capital ratio will be 10.20% 
(based upon the midpoint of the Estimated Valuation Range). As a result, the 
Association will be a well-capitalized institution. 

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the Conversion may be more 
or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of
 shares to be issued in the Conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in the 
estimated pro forma market value of the Association. Payments for shares made 
through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at the Association will not 
result in the receipt of new funds for investment by the Association but will 
result in a reduction of the Association's interest expense and liabilities as 
funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or other deposit 
accounts."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) It is anticipated that the net proceeds received by the Bank will be used 
primarily to fund investments in loans and securities and also for general 
corporate purposes. 
The Company expects to contribute approximately $8,500,000 of the net proceeds 
of the offering to the Bank by purchasing all of the Bank's common stock to be 
issued. This purchase of the Bank's stock is intended to provide the Bank with 
the capital required by regulators to commence operations. The Bank plans to 
use approximately $115,000 for leasehold improvements and related architectural 
and engineering services, and approximately $130,000 to purchase furniture, 
fixtures and equipment and other necessary assets for the Bank's operations. 
The Company expects to use approximately $37,000 of the net proceeds to pay for
 organizational expenses of the Bank. These organizational expenses, and other 
preopening expenses and offering expenses, were financed on an interim basis 
from loans of approximately $415,000 at an interest rate of 5.0% per annum made 
to the Company by members of its Board of Directors. These loans include 
$120,000 loaned as of August 31, 1998 and an additional $295,000 loaned 
subsequent to August 31, 1998. It is anticipated that this approximately 
$415,000 of loans will be repaid by the Company promptly following the 
completion of the offering, using $285,000 of net offering proceeds and 
$130,000 cash on hand. It is currently anticipated that the balance of the net 
proceeds received by the Bank will be used to fund investments in loans and 
securities and for payment of operating expenses. The remaining net proceeds 
(plus any net proceeds as a result of the exercise of the Underwriter's over-
allotment option) will initially be invested by the Company in investment grade 
securities and otherwise held by the Company as working capital for general 
corporate purposes and to pay operating expenses, as well as for possible 
future capital contributions to the Bank. The funds will also be available to 
finance possible acquisitions of other branches or expansion into other lines 
of business closely related to banking, although the Company presently has no 
plans to do so."

estimated expenses related to the Offering. The net proceeds from the Direct

Direct Sales is to enable the Company to implement its business plan to enter 
into the variable life insurance and fixed annuity and other reinsurance

exercised in full), at an initial public offering price of $10.00 per share and 
after deducting estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses 
payable by the Company. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working capital, 
create a public market for the Company's Common Stock and facilitate future 
access by the Company to public equity markets. The Company expects to use 
approximately $6.1 million of the net proceeds for capital expenditures, with 
the remaining approximately $21.0 million (approximately $25.2 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) to be used for working
capital and general corporate purposes, including expanding its direct sales, 
telesales and marketing operations and systems and infrastructure development 
activities. 

The foregoing amounts represent estimates and the amounts actually expended by 
the Company for such purposes may vary significantly and will depend on a number
 of factors, including the amount of the Company's future revenues and cash 
generated by operations and the other factors described under ""Risk Factors."" 
Accordingly, the Company's management will retain broad discretion in the 
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. A portion of the net proceeds 
may also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses. The Company 
has no current agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition or
investment, and the Company is not currently engaged in any negotiations with 
respect to any such transaction. Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this 
offering will be invested in short-term, interest bearing, investment grade 
securities. See ""Risk Factors -- Broad Discretion of Use of Proceeds."" 

The Company estimates the net proceeds of this offering, together with existing 
capital resources, will be sufficient to fund the Company's requirements for at 
least twelve months from the date of this Prospectus."

be determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated 
that such proceeds will be between $133.0 million and $180.6 million ($207.9 
million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%). See ""Pro Forma 
Data"" and ""The Conversion and the Merger--Stock Pricing and the Number of Shares
to be Offered in the Conversion"" for a description and discussion of the 
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. Seacoast Financial will be unable to
utilize any of the net proceeds of the Conversion until the consummation of the 
Conversion. 

Seacoast Financial will contribute at least 50% of the net proceeds of the 
Conversion to Compass, or $66.5 million to $90.3 million at the minimum and 
maximum, respectively, of the Estimated Valuation Range. Compass intends to add 
such funds to its general funds, to be used for general corporate purposes, 
including investments in short- and medium-term, investment-grade debt 
securities, including U.S. Government and Agency securities, corporate bonds and
mortgage-backed securities. Depending on market conditions, Compass also intends
to use the funds to increase its loan originations and may use funds to open 
new branches. Compass also intends to use approximately $20.0 million of the 
funds for the construction of a new main office. 

Net proceeds retained by Seacoast Financial will be used to fund the loan to 
Compass's ESOP to acquire up to 8% of the Conversion Shares issued in the 
Offerings. Seacoast Financial intends to invest any remaining net proceeds 
retained by it in short- and medium-term, investment-grade debt securities, 
including U.S. Government and Agency securities, corporate bonds and mortgage-
backed securities. Seacoast Financial may also use a portion of the net proceeds
it retains to pay dividends on its issued and outstanding capital stock. See 
""Seacoast Financial's Dividend Policy."" 

Seacoast Financial and Compass may also use the funds to expand operations 
through acquisitions of other banks or branch offices of other banks or 
acquisitions of other financial services companies, such as insurance agencies. 
However, neither Seacoast Financial nor Compass has any current arrangements, 
understandings or agreements regarding any such transactions, other than the 
Merger (for which neither will use any of the Conversion proceeds because the 
Merger is structured as a stock-for-stock exchange). 

To the extent that the stock-based benefit programs which Seacoast Financial or 
Compass may adopt subsequent to the Conversion are not funded with authorized 
but unissued Seacoast Financial Common Stock, Seacoast Financial or Compass may 
use net proceeds from the Conversion to fund the purchase of Seacoast Financial 
Common Stock to be awarded under such stock benefit programs, if any. See 
""Management of Seacoast Financial and Compass--Compensation of Officers and 
Directors through Benefit Plans--Stock Option Plan"" and ""--Stock Plan."" 

Finally, although it has no current intention to do so, Seacoast Financial may 
in the future decide to repurchase shares of its issued and outstanding capital 
stock, to the extent that such repurchases are consistent with the preservation 
of pooling-of-interests accounting treatment under GAAP of the Merger and of 
possible future acquisitions, if any. Any such stock repurchase program would be
based upon facts and circumstances at the time of adoption of such a program, 
including but not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price 
at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the 
attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return 
and risk involved in such alternatives, the ability to increase the book value 
and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares and the 
opportunity to improve Seacoast Financial's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance
of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover 
the exercise of stock options or to fund stock plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of Seacoast 
Financial and its stockholders. 

In order to preserve pooling-of-interests accounting treatment under GAAP of 
the Merger, Seacoast Financial's ability to repurchase shares of its common 
stock may be limited during the two-year period following consummation of the 
Merger. Moreover, in the event Seacoast Financial determines to repurchase 
stock, such repurchases will be made at market prices which may be in excess of 
the Purchase Price in the Offering. Any stock repurchases will be subject to the
determination of the Board of Directors that both Seacoast Financial and Compass
will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after 
any such repurchases and that such capital will be adequate, taking into 
account, among other things, the level of non-performing and other risk assets, 
Seacoast Financial's and Compass's current and projected results of operations 
and asset/liability structure, the economic environment, tax and other 
considerations. The repurchase of stock or payment of dividends, however, would 
be prohibited if Compass's net worth would be reduced below the amount required 
for the liquidation account to be established for the benefit of Eligible 
Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders. See ""The Conversion

The General Partner will use $110 million of the cash distributed to it to 
retire a portion of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition
of the All American Pipeline and the SJV Gathering System. Of this indebtedness,
$60 million bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75% and $50 million bears
interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%. The indebtedness has a final maturity 
in 2005. The remainder of the distribution to the General Partner will be 
distributed or loaned to Plains Resources, which will use the cash to repay 
indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. 

The Partnership will use the net proceeds from any exercise of the Underwriters'
over-allotment option to redeem Common Units from the General Partner or its 
affiliates, on a pro rata basis, equal to the number of Common Units issued upon
the exercise of such option."

(1) These notes were issued to 18 accredited investors and bear interest at 8% 
per annum. The net proceeds from the notes were used for capital expenditures 
and working capital. See ""Financings--December 1997 Private Placement."" 
(2) Such loans, if taken by such officers, will mature in five years and will 
bear interest at 5% per annum. See ""Management--Employment Agreements."" 

The foregoing represents the Company's current estimate of its proposed use 
of the net proceeds of this Offering based upon the present state of its 
business, operations and plans, current business conditions and the Company's 
evaluation of the market for its services. Except for the payment of the 1997 
Notes, for which approximately $270,000 is required (inclusive of estimated 
interest), management will have broad discretion with respect to the expenditure
of a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this Offering. In particular, 
management will have broad discretion to allocate funds to marketing, product 
development and other working capital purposes, based on the business of the 
Company as it develops from time to time. 

The Company intends to use the portion of the proceeds devoted to marketing to 
continue to market its core software product, MuSE, and its proprietary software
product, Continuum, in certain strategic markets. The Company intends to hire 
additional sales and marketing personnel with expertise and contacts in such 
targeted markets. Additionally, the Company will seek to leverage its existing 
relationships and applications of its software products to enhance its marketing
efforts. In addition, the Company will devote a portion of the proceeds to 
market its custom design and consulting and support services relating to MuSE. 
Such funds may also be used to assist customers in marketing the Company's 
products and services. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations"" and ""Business--The CRI Agreement."" 

The Company intends to use the portion of the proceeds devoted to product 
development to redesign, develop and update the MuSE software and its related 
products to facilitate its use within high-end industrial, scientific and 
educational sectors. The Company may also use such proceeds to develop new 
products and enhance existing products to improve price and performance, expand 
product capabilities, simplify user interfaces and develop interoperability with
most products and devices commonly used in the Company's targeted markets. 

The Company intends to use the portion of the proceeds devoted for working 
capital to maintain and fulfill its current obligations under license contracts,
employment agreements and other material agreements and for other corporate 
purposes which may include capital expenditures that may be incurred in the 
normal course of business. 

Conditions may develop which could cause management to reallocate proceeds from 
the categories listed above, including changes in its marketing program, the 
ability of the Company to enter into agreements or arrangements with strategic 
partners and changes in government policy, none of which can be predicted with 
any degree of certainty. Furthermore, future events, including unforseen 
problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently 
encountered by businesses, as well as changes in the economic climate, changes 
or anticipated changes in government regulations, new technologies, competition,
reimbursement policies or acquisition or joint venture opportunities, may make 
the reallocation of funds necessary or desirable. Any such reallocation will be 
at the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

The Company anticipates, based upon its current plans, that the net proceeds of 
this Offering, together with the net proceeds from the sale of securities to 
CRI in July 1998 and funds generated from operations, including payments and 
royalties received through the date of this Prospectus under the CRI Agreement, 
will be sufficient to satisfy its contemplated cash requirements for at least
twelve months. However, if the Company's current and projected needs change due
to unanticipated events or otherwise, the Company may be required to obtain 
additional financing and there can be no assurance that additional financing 
will be available or that the terms of any financing will be acceptable to the 
Company. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to 
delay, scale back or eliminate one or more of its product development programs, 
including but not limited to the further development of MuSE and Continuum or 
related products, or the Company may be forced to obtain funds through entering 
into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the 
Company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or products that the
Company would not otherwise relinquish. The Company has no current arrangements 
with respect to, or sources of, additional financing. 

To the extent that the Underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised, 
additional net proceeds will be added to working capital. Pending utilization 
of the proceeds of this Offering, the Company may make temporary investments in 
bank certificates of deposit, prime commercial paper, United States Government 
obligations, investments in money-market funds or other similar short-term 
low-risk investments."

Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses, are estimated to be $12.0 million ($13.9 million if the over-allotment

The Company intends to contribute approximately $5.0 million of capital to the 
Bank, to contribute approximately $3.5 million to a planned subsidiary of the 
Company which will invest in real estate for the purpose of development and 
resale, and to use approximately $1.5 million of the net proceeds to complete 
the Bank's tenth branch location, which is expected to begin operations in 1999,
with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include,
without limitation, purchase and construction of future bank branch locations, 
additional capital contributions to the Bank and subsidiaries (including a title
company) and possible future acquisitions of financial institutions. The $5.0 
million of additional capital contribution to the Bank will result in an 
increased legal lending limit which is designed to further the Bank's internal 
growth objectives. Although the Company does not presently have any discussions 
or negotiations underway relating to acquisitions, the Company in the future 
intends to review and solicit acquisition opportunities and, at any given time, 
may attempt to acquire financial institutions. Pending their application, the 
net proceeds may be invested in short-term, marketable, investment grade 
interest-bearing securities."

(1) The Company intends to repay a $900,000 loan which it secured from Jacob 
Herzog's father-in-law, in July 1998 for interim financing. Such loan bears 
interest at 7.5% and is payable on the earlier of demand or November 30, 1998. 

(2) Includes costs associated with hiring a national sales manager, a regional 
sales manager and opening a sales office in the United States. 

(3) Represents the cost to upgrade the Company's current computer system. 

(4) Includes moving costs and certain one time capital expenditures to be 
incurred in preparing its new warehouse space. The Company believes that the 
rental costs associated with the new warehouse will be commensurate with its 
current rental costs. 

(5) The net proceeds allocated to working capital include funds for general 
corporate purposes including the financing of the Company's accounts receivable 
and possible strategic acquisitions. The Company has not currently identified 
any acquisition candidates. 

The foregoing represents the Company's estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of the Offering based upon the current status of its operations and 
anticipated business needs. It is possible, however, that the application of 
funds will differ considerably from the estimates set forth herein due to 
changes in the economic climate and/or the Company's planned business operations
or unanticipated complications, delays and expenses, as well as any potential 
acquisitions that the Company may consummate, although no specific acquisition 
has been identified. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations."" Any reallocation of the net proceeds will 
be at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

Any additional net proceeds realized from the exercise of the Over-Allotment 
Option (up to approximately $1,076,625) will be added to the Company's working 
capital. 

Pending application, the net proceeds will be invested principally in short-
term certificates of deposit, money market funds or short-term treasury bonds. 

The Company estimates that the net proceeds from this Offering will be 
sufficient to meet the Company's liquidity and working capital requirements for 
a period of at least 12 months from the completion of this Offering. In the 
event that the Company acquires any additional product lines, although no 
specific acquisition has been identified, such funds will be derived from the 
funds currently allocated to working capital or from revenues generated from 
the Company's operations."

(1) The Company expects to use approximately $5.1 million of the net proceeds 
to repay indebtedness ($4.7 million) incurred to pay a portion of the purchase 
price for the Salerno Acquisition, interest accrued thereon and related fees. 
Such indebtedness bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum through August 3, 
1998 and 15% per annum thereafter and matures on the earlier of 
(i) November 16, 1998, (ii) consummation of an initial public offering of 
Common Stock or other recapitalization (whether through one transaction or a 
series of transactions) of the Company (whether through a private placement 
or otherwise) from which the Company receives gross proceeds of at least 
$7.0 million or (iii) a sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of 
the assets or equity interests in the Company. The related fees of $265,000 do 
not bear interest and are payable contemporaneously with the aforementioned 
indebtedness. The Company expects to use approximately $560,000 of the net 
proceeds to repay the Acquisition Loan ($500,000), interest accrued thereon and 
related fees incurred to pay a portion of the purchase price for the Salerno 
Acquisition. Such indebtedness bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum and 
matures on the earlier of (i) November 30, 1998 or (ii) consummation of an 
initial public offering of Common Stock from which the Company receives gross 
proceeds of at least $7.0 million. The related fees of $25,000 do not bear 
interest and are payable contemporaneously with the Acquisition Loan. 

(2) The Company expects to use approximately $3.6 million of the net proceeds 
for the payment of outstanding trade payables. 

(3) The Company expects to use the balance of the net proceeds, approximately 
$400,000, for general corporate purposes and working capital including the 
expansion of existing product lines, the development of new product categories, 
including the commission of marketing studies, and the upgrading of the 
Company's facilities. A portion of the net proceeds allocated to general 
corporate purposes may also be used to acquire one or more companies. The 
Company may seek to acquire, when feasible, companies whose businesses are 
compatible with those of the Company. The Company does not currently have any 
agreements, commitments or arrangements with respect to any proposed 
acquisitions, and no assurance can be given that any acquisition opportunity 
will be consummated in the future. 

Any additional net proceeds realized from the exercise of the Underwriters' 
over-allotment option will be allocated to the Company's general corporate 
purposes. 

The initial allocation of the net proceeds of this offering set forth above 
represents the Company's best estimate based upon its present plans and certain 
assumptions regarding general economic and industry conditions and the Company's
future revenues and expenditures. The Company reserves the right to reallocate 
these proceeds within the above-mentioned categories in response to, among other
things, changes in its plans, industry or general economic conditions and the 
Company's future revenues and expenditures. The Company believes the amount 
available under its revolving credit facility, together with the net proceeds 
from the offering, will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to 
finance its operations, service interest payments on its debt and fund capital 
expenditures. 


Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company will 
invest the net proceeds in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term, investment-
grade, interest-bearing investments."

Currently, we expect that in accordance with applicable OTS regulations and 
policies, the Company will retain $1.4 million, $1.7 million, $2.0 million and 
$2.3 million, respectively, at the minimum, midpoint, maximum and maximum as 
adjusted of the Estimated Valuation Range. The balance will be used to purchase 
all of the capital stock we will issue in connection with the conversion. A 
portion of the net proceeds to be retained by the Company will be lent to the 
ESOP to fund its purchase of 8% of the shares sold in the conversion. On a 
short-term basis, the balance of the net proceeds retained by the Company 
initially will be invested in short-term investments. A portion of the net 
proceeds may also be used to fund the purchase of 4% of the shares for the MRP, 
which is anticipated to be adopted following the conversion. See ""Pro Forma 
Data."" 

The Bank expects to use its portion of the net conversion proceeds as follows. 
First, a portion of the net proceeds will be used to fund our other lending 
activities, which are primarily the origination of construction/permanent loans 
on one- to four-family residences, multi-family real estate mortgage loans as 
well as commercial real estate, home equity and savings account loans. We also 
have plans to lease or purchase property to establish a branch in Cecil and/or 
Harford County, Maryland, areas which we consider attractive for future growth.
 We estimate spending approximately $120,000 on establishing the branch and 
expect that the new branch will cost approximately $40,000 in its first year of
operation. We believe that the establishment of new branches will help us take
 advantage of strong loan demand in our market areas. Finally, our business 
plan contemplates spending $1.5 million on a new office building approximately 
two years following the conversion. However, our plans to establish new 
branches and to relocate our main office may be impeded or delayed by the 
rating we received in our most recent CRA evaluation. See ""Risk Factors -- 
Risks Associated with ""Needs to Improve"" CRA Rating"" and ""Regulation --
Community Reinvestment Act."" As part of our plan to improve our CRA performance,
 we intend to invest $380,000 (which represents 10% of the gross proceeds at 
the midpoint of the Estimated Valuation Range) in loans to first-time low- and 
moderate-income home buyers. This investment of the conversion proceeds is part 
of a CRA action plan we have adopted which includes: (i) offering high loan-to-
value mortgage loans with discounted rates; (ii) expanding our solicitation, 
advertising and education efforts to reach low- and moderate-income borrowers; 
and (iii) purchasing low- and moderate-income loans from brokers at a premium. 
See ""Business of Northfield Federal Savings --Lending Activities."" 
The net proceeds may vary because the total expenses of the conversion may be 
more or less than those estimated. We expect our expenses to be $400,000. Our 
estimated net proceeds will range from $2.8 million to $4.0 million (or up to 
$4.6 million in the event the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range is 
increased to $5.0 million) (excluding the value of any Contingent Shares issued)
. See ""Pro Forma Data."" The net proceeds will also vary if the number of shares
 to be issued in the conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in our 
estimated pro forma market value. Payments for shares made through withdrawals 
from existing deposit accounts with us will not result in the receipt of new 
funds for investment by us but will result in a reduction of our liabilities 
and interest expense as funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates
 or accounts. 

For a period of one year following the completion of the conversion, we will 
not pay any dividends that would be construed as a return of capital nor take 
any actions to pursue or propose such dividends."

$1,750,000 for the salaries and related costs of up to 20 additional sales and 
marketing personnel. See ""Business--Sales and Marketing."" 

(2) Represents estimated costs associated with software development, including 
the salaries of up to 12 additional software engineers and developers. See 
""Business--Product Development."" 

(3) Represents payment of (i) estimated past due trade payables and 
(ii) approximately $95,000 of certain liabilities assumed by the Company in 
connection with the CommHome Acquisition. See ""Business-- CommHome Systems

(4) Represents amounts to repay (i) $575,000 principal amount of promissory 
notes issued from February 1997 through October 1998, plus estimated accrued 
interest thereon at annual rates between 6% and 10%, including $102,811 which 
will be paid to Charles P. Stevenson, Jr., a principal stockholder of the 
Company, and affiliated entities, $75,000 which will be paid to Applewood 
Associates, L.P., a principal stockholder of the Company, and $56,235 which will
be paid to Corey M. Horowitz, Chairman of the Board of Directors and a principal
stockholder of the Company, and CMH Capital Management Corp., of which Mr. 
Horowitz is the sole stockholder. The Company used the net proceeds from the 
issuance of the promissory notes for working capital and general corporate 
purposes. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

(5) Represents expenditures to purchase hardware and software as well as servers
and test equipment for the Company's operations. 

(6) Represents costs associated with relocating the Company's principal office 
location to the Boston, Massachusetts area, including rent and related costs. 
See ""Business--Facilities."" 

(7) Represents amounts which may be used to pay a portion of the compensation 
for executive officers (such aggregate salaries are estimated to be $960,000 
during the twelve months following the consummation of this offering), rent, 
consulting fees and professional fees. 

If the Underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full, the Company 
will realize additional net proceeds of $1,331,100, of which 50% will be 
allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes and 50% will be 
allocated to repay additional indebtedness. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The allocation of the net proceeds from this offering set forth above represents
the Company's best estimate based upon its currently proposed plans and 
assumptions relating to its operations and certain assumptions regarding general
economic conditions. If any of these factors change, the Company may find it 
necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-
described categories or to use portions thereof for other purposes. The Company 
may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses, 
technologies, or products which it believes are complimentary to those of the 
Company, although there are currently no commitments or agreements with respect 
to any such acquisitions as of the date of this Prospectus, except for the 
acquisition of CommHome. See ""Business-- CommHome Systems Corporation Acquisition."" 
Based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its operations, 
and implementation of its business plan (including the timetable of costs and 
expenses associated with, and success of, its marketing efforts) the Company 
anticipates that the net proceeds of this offering, together with projected 
revenues from operations, will be sufficient to fund the Company's operations 
and capital requirements for approximately twelve months following the 
consummation of this offering. There can be no assurance, however, that such 
funds will not be expended prior thereto due to unanticipated changes in 
economic conditions or other unforeseen circumstances. In the event the 
Company's plans change or its assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate 
(due to unanticipated expenses, difficulties, delays or otherwise) or the net 
proceeds of this offering and projected revenues otherwise prove to be 
insufficient to fund the implementation of the Company's business plan or 
working capital requirements, the Company could be required to seek additional 
financing sooner than currently anticipated. The Company has no current 
arrangements with respect to any additional financing. Consequently, there can 
be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to the Company 
when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, or other similar short-term, interest bearing 
investments."

deducting the underwriting discount and estimated Offering expenses, are 
estimated to be approximately $10.0 million, or $12.8 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is fully exercised. The Company intends to 
use $2.0 million of such proceeds for repayment of indebtedness (the 
""Indebtedness"") to Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association (""Norwest"") 
incurred in connection with the Union Acquisition. The principal amount of the 
Indebtedness is repayable over a seven year period and bears interest at the 
federal funds rate plus 2.75%. The Indebtedness is secured by all of the capital
stock of the Bank. Although the Company has no specific plans for the remaining 
net proceeds, the Company has elected to make the Offering at this time in order
to have funds available to support anticipated balance sheet growth and to use 
in connection with any future acquisition opportunities that the Company decides
to pursue. 

Pending the application of the net proceeds, the Company intends to invest such 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing securities, certificates of deposit or 
guaranteed obligations of the United States of America."

(regardless of whether or not the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
Offering expenses payable by the Company. 

The Company expects to use such net proceeds for general corporate purposes, 
including expansion of its sales and marketing capabilities, possible strategic 
acquisitions or investments and working capital requirements. The Company 
evaluates potential strategic acquisitions or investments, but at the present 
time the Company has no understandings, commitments or agreements with respect 
to any such acquisition or investment. Pending such uses, the Company intends 
to invest the net proceeds from the Offering in United States government 
securities and investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments. The Company has 
made no material commitments or allocations for the net proceeds, and the use 
of the proceeds will depend upon developments and opportunities in the Company's
business and the Internet industry in general. 

The foregoing represents the Company's present intentions based upon its present
plans and business conditions. The occurrence of certain unforeseen events or 
changed business conditions, however, could result in the application of the 
proceeds of the Offering in a manner other than as described in this Prospectus.

The Company intends to use the entire net proceeds from the Offerings to repay 
a portion of the amounts due under the Intercompany Notes. The Intercompany 
Notes were issued prior to the consummation of the Offerings and represent all 
outstanding intercompany borrowings and the payment of dividends by the Company
 to a subsidiary of News Corporation. The Intercompany Notes constitute 
unsecured, general obligations of the Company and mature on June 30, 2003. The 
Intercompany Notes bear interest at a rate equal to the average cost of long-
term debt of News Corporation (currently approximately 8% per annum), adjusted 
annually and payable quarterly. Immediately following consummation of the

determined until the Conversion is completed, the net proceeds are expected to
range from $50,312,500 to $79,166,120. See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The
Conversion--Stock Pricing and Number of Shares to be Issued"" for a discussion of
the assumptions used to estimate those amounts. The proceeds will not be
available unless and until the Conversion is completed.
    The Company will use 50% of the net proceeds from the sale of the Common
Stock to purchase the capital stock of the Bank. Therefore, it is estimated that
the amount paid by the Company to the Bank, before non-cash accounting
adjustments, will range from $25,156,250 to $39,583,060. The Bank intends to
invest its share of the net proceeds in short-term and medium-term,
investment-grade debt securities. The amount received will become part of the
Bank's general funds, which the Bank currently intends to gradually deploy to
increase its levels of one- to four-family real estate lending and, to a lesser
extent, other lending, depending on market conditions as suitable opportunities
arise. The Company expects that initially it will use the net proceeds remaining
in its hands, after funding the loan to the ESOP, to make investments in short
and intermediate term investment-grade debt securities. The Company may also use
the proceeds it retains to purchase stock to fund the PRRP or to satisfy the
exercise of options issued under the Stock Option Plan. Those purchases would
generally not occur for at least six months after the Conversion and generally
not until after stockholders approve the two plans. The Company may also
contribute all or a portion of the net proceeds retained by it to the Bank as
additional capital. See ""Management of the Bank--Benefits--Stock Option Plan""
and ""--Benefits--Personnel Recognition and Retention Program.""
    If depositors with first priority subscription rights purchase all the
Common Stock available in the Conversion, the ESOP will purchase its Common
Stock of the Company in the open market after the Conversion is completed. If
the ESOP purchases 8% of the Common Stock issued in the Conversion, including
Common Stock contributed to the Foundation, at a price of $10.00 per share, the
ESOP loan will be from $4,248,300 to $6,609,850, depending upon the number of
shares sold in the Conversion. If the ESOP must purchase its Common Stock on the
open market when the price of the Company's Common Stock is more than $10.00 per
share, the amount of the ESOP loan will be more than if the ESOP is able to
purchase its Common Stock in the Subscription Offering. The Company estimates
that the term of the ESOP loan will be twenty years. The Company and Bank may
choose to fund the ESOP's stock purchases with a loan by a third party financial
institution. See ""Management of the Bank--Benefits--Employee Stock Ownership
Plan.""
    The Bank and the Company may also use the net proceeds from the Conversion
to support future expansion through, for example, purchasing branches,
establishing new branches, acquiring other financial institutions, or expanding
into other businesses. The Company and the Bank have no current arrangements,
understandings or agreements for any such expansion. The Company, after the
Conversion, will be a bank holding company which, under existing law, may engage
in only limited types of businesses which are closely related to and a proper
incident to banking. See ""Regulation--Holding Company Regulation.""
    After the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company may approve
stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements, and
use a portion of the net proceeds to implement the repurchase plans. The Company
may not repurchase any Common Stock in the first year after the Conversion and,
unless approved by the Superintendent, during the next two years may only
repurchase up to 5% of its outstanding capital stock each year. Further, the
Company may not repurchase any of its Common Stock if the repurchase would cause
the Bank to become ""undercapitalized."" See ""Regulation-- Banking
Regulation--Enforcement."" The Board of Directors may authorize the use of a
portion of the net proceeds to repurchase stock depending upon facts and
circumstances in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include, for
example: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is
trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other
investment alternatives,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the
remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to improve the Company's
return on equity; (ii) avoiding dilution by not having to issue additional
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit
plans; and (iii) capital needs of the Company and the Bank in light of the level
of non-performing loans, current and projected results of operations, the
economic environment and other considerations. If the Company repurchases stock
for more than book value per share, the book value per share for remaining
shares would be reduced. The Company will not repurchase any stock if the
repurchase would cause the Company or the Bank not to satisfy any minimum
regulatory capital ratio requirements."

those shares of Common Stock received by the Selling Shareholders in exchange

use of funds based on the plans and estimates of the Organizers, actual expenses
may vary from the estimates. The Organizers believe that the minimum proceeds of
$5,000,000  from the Offering will satisfy the cash  requirements of the Company
and the Bank for their  respective  first year of operations but there can be no
assurance that this will be the case.  Because the Company and Bank constitute a
new enterprise,  the Organizers cannot predict with any certainty to what extent
the Bank will generate  revenues from  investments and loan  originations.  As a
result,  the Organizers cannot predict precisely what the actual  application of
proceeds  will be.  However,  there is no  assurance  that the  proceeds  of the
Offering  will be  sufficient  to meet the future  capital  requirements  of the
Company without additional financing.

     The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of 500,000 and 600,000 shares
of Common Stock in the Offering are  estimated  at  $5,000,000  and  $6,000,000,
respectively, since the preoperating and Offering expenses estimated at $300,000
are expected to be paid  primarily  from the proceeds of the Private  Placement.
Estimated  preoperating  and Offering  expenses  are the total of the  following
estimated expenses:  preoperating salaries and benefits - $148,000;  marketing -
$10,500; legal - $50,000; accounting - $9,500; consulting -$20,000; printing and
office  supplies  - $10,000;  filing  fees -  $20,000;  and other  miscellaneous
operating expenses - $32,000. As a result of delays in the Offering,  regulatory
comments and other factors,  expenses may be significantly greater. On the basis
of the foregoing assumptions,  gross proceeds,  expenses and net proceeds at the

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $13.7 million
and $18.7 million (or $21.6 million if the Estimated Price Range is increased by
15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion--Stock Pricing"" as to the 
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Company will be unable to 
utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offerings until the consummation of the 
Conversion. 

The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the 
Association to be issued upon Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds
of the Offering. Such proceeds will be added to the Association's general funds 
to be used for general corporate purposes, including investment in loans, 
particularly single-family residential mortgage loans, non-residential real 
estate loans, including commercial real estate loans in the Association's 
primary market area, and construction loans, including home equity loans. The 
Association expects that the level of such lending activity generally will be 
proportionately consistent with its existing lending policies. See ""Business of 
the Association--Lending Activities."" The Association also plans to use such 
proceeds to invest in short- to intermediate-term securities and mortgage-backed
securities and fund the Stock-Based Incentive Plan. In addition, under 
appropriate market conditions, the Company may repay advances from the FHLB-
Cincinnati. The Association has no current arrangements, understandings or 
agreements regarding any such transactions. 

Net proceeds to be retained by the Company after the purchase of the capital 
stock of the Association, and including the loan to the ESOP, are estimated to 
be between $6.9 million and $9.4 million (or $10.8 million if the Estimated 
Price Range is increased by 15%). The net proceeds retained by the Company will 
initially be invested primarily in short- to intermediate-term securities and 
mortgage-backed securities. The Company intends to use a portion of the net 
proceeds to make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8.0%
of the Common Stock issued in the Conversion. Based upon the issuance of 
1,445,000 shares and 1,955,000 shares at the minimum and maximum of the 
Estimated Price Range, the amount of the loan to the ESOP would be $1.2 million 
or $1.6 million, respectively (or $1.8 million if the Estimated Price Range is 
increased by 15%) to be repaid over a 12-year period at the prevailing prime 
rate of interest, which is currently 8.5%. See ""Management of the Association--
Benefits--Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust."" 

The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the future
expansion of operations through the acquisition of other savings associations 
and commercial banks or diversification into other banking related businesses. 
The Company may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund the Stock Programs. 
The Company has no current arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding
 any such transactions. The Company, upon the Conversion, will be a unitary 
savings and loan holding company, which under existing laws would generally not 
be restricted as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, 
provided that the Association continues to be a qualified thrift lender (""QTL"").
See ""Regulation--Holding Company Regulation"" for a description of certain 
regulations and proposed regulations applicable to the Company. 

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company will 
have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, the Company, pursuant to 
OTS regulations, will be prohibited from repurchasing any shares of the Common 
Stock for three years except for (i) an offer to all stockholders on a pro rata
basis, (ii) the repurchase of qualifying shares of a director, or (iii) a 
purchase in the open market by an employee stock benefit plan. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided below, beginning one year 
following completion of the Conversion, the Company may repurchase its Common 
Stock so long as (i) the repurchases within the following two years are part of 
an open-market program not involving greater than 5% of its outstanding capital 
stock during a twelve-month period, (ii) the repurchases do not cause the 
Association to become ""undercapitalized"" within the meaning of the OTS prompt 
corrective action regulation, and (iii) the Company provides to the Regional 
Director of the OTS no later than 10 days prior to the commencement of a 
repurchase program written notice containing a full description of the program 
to be undertaken and such program is not disapproved by the Regional Director. 
See ""Regulation--Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action."" In addition, under 
current OTS policies, repurchases may be allowed in the first year following 
Conversion and in amounts greater than 5% in the second and third years 
following Conversion provided there are valid and compelling business reasons 
for such repurchases and the OTS does not object to such repurchases. 

Based upon facts and circumstances following Conversion and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but 
not be limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which 
the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness 
of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk 
involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or 
earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to 
improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company
and its shareholders. In the event the Company determines to repurchase stock, 
such repurchases may be made at market prices which may be in excess of the 
Purchase Price in the Conversion.
 
Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of 
Directors that both the Company and the Association will be capitalized in 
excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and 
that such capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, 
thelevel of non-performing and other risk assets, the Company's and the
Association's current and projected results of operations and asset/liability 
structure, the economic environment and tax and other considerations. See ""The 
Conversion--Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After 
Conversion."" 

In connection with the Conversion, the Company and the Association have 
committed to the OTS that, during the one-year period following consummation of 
the Conversion, the Company will not take any steps in furtherance of a 
distribution to stockholders that, for federal tax purposes, would be treated as
a return of capital without prior approval of the OTS."

determined until the Offering is completed, it is presently anticipated that the
net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $6.5 million and 
$9.0 million (or $10.4 million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 
15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Reorganization and Offering--Stock Pricing 
and Number of Shares to Be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such 
amounts. The Company will be unable to utilize any of the net proceeds of the 
Offering until the consummation of the Reorganization. 

The Company will contribute 50% of the net proceeds of the Offering to the Bank,
or $3.2 million to $5.2 million at the minimum and adjusted maximum of the 
Estimated Valuation Range, respectively. Such portion of net proceeds received 
by the Bank from the Company will be used by the Bank for general corporate 
purposes, including investments in short- and medium-term investment grade debt 
securities, in mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and to increase the 
origination of mortgage, consumer and commercial business loans. The Bank may 
also use such funds to expand operations through acquisitions of other financial
institutions, branch offices or other financial services companies, although the
Bank and the Company have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements 
regarding any such transactions. To the extent that the stock-based benefit 
programs that the Company intends to adopt subsequent to the Offering are not 
funded with authorized-but-unissued shares of Common Stock, the Company or the 
Bank may use net proceeds from the Offering to fund the purchase of stock to be 
awarded under such stock benefit programs. See ""Risk Factors--Dilutive Effect of
Stock Award Plan and Stock Option Plan"" and ""Management of the Bank--Executive 
Compensation--Stock Option Plan"" and ""--Stock Award Plan."" 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains to make a 
loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase Common Stock equal to 
8% of the Minority Ownership Interest. Based upon the sale of 705,039 shares or 
953,877 shares at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range, 
respectively, the amount of the loan to the ESOP would be $588,900 or $796,750, 
respectively (or $916,000 if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%).
See ""Management of the Bank--Executive Compensation--Employee Stock Ownership 
Plan and Trust."" The remaining net proceeds retained by the Company will 
initially be invested in U.S. government and agency securities, short- and 
medium-term debt obligations, mortgage-backed securities and other marketable 
securities. 

The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the future 
expansion of operations through the acquisition of financial institutions or 
their assets, including those located within the Bank's market area, or 
diversification into other banking related businesses. However, the Company and 
the Bank have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding 
any such transactions. Upon completion of the Reorganization, the Company will 
be a bank holding company, and will be permitted to engage only in those 
activities that are permissible for bank holding companies under the Bank 
Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. See 
""Regulation -- Holding Company Regulation"" for a description of certain 
regulations applicable to the Company. 

Upon completion of the Reorganization, the board of directors of the Company 
will have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory 
and regulatory requirements. Pursuant to New York regulations, and without the 
prior approval of the Department, the Company may not repurchase any Common 
Stock in the first year after the Reorganization, and during each of the next 
two following years, may not repurchase more than 5% of its shares outstanding.
In addition, the FDIC prohibits an insured savings bank that has converted from 
the mutual to stock form of ownership from repurchasing its capital stock within
one year following the date of completion of its stock offering, except that 
stock repurchases of no greater than 5% of a bank's outstanding capital stock 
may be repurchased during this one-year period where compelling and valid 
business reasons are established to the satisfaction of the FDIC. Based upon 
facts and circumstances following completion of the Reorganization and subject
to applicable regulatory requirements, the board of directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but not
be limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the 
stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of 
other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved 
in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per 
share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to improve the 
Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by 
not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or 
to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which
repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
In the event the Company determines to repurchase stock, such repurchases may be
made at market prices which may be in excess of the $10.00 per share purchase 
price in the Offering (the ""Subscription Price""). Any stock repurchases will be 
subject to the determination of the Company's board of directors that both the

payment of expenses incurred in connection with the Conversion, and will use the
balance of the proceeds to purchase all of the capital stock issued by Lincoln 
Federal in connection with the Conversion. A portion of the net proceeds to be 
retained by the Holding Company will be loaned to our ESOP to fund its purchase 
of 8% of the shares of the Holding Company sold in the Conversion and issued to 
the Foundation. On a short-term basis, the balance of the net proceeds retained 
by the Holding Company initially may be invested in cash and short-term 
investments. The Holding Company may also use the proceeds as a source of funds 
to acquire one or more other financial institutions, to acquire assets from 
other financial institutions, to pay dividends, if any, to shareholders or to 
repurchase shares of Common Stock. The Holding Company does not, however, have 
any present plans, negotiations or agreements to acquire another financial 
institution or to acquire assets from another financial institution. Neither 
Lincoln Federal nor the Holding Company will take any action to further the 
payment of a return of capital dividend for one year following the Conversion. 
In the event the Foundation is approved by our members, the Holding Company 
proposes to fund the Foundation with 200,000 shares of the Holding Company's 
Common Stock. 

Lincoln Federal intends to use a portion of the net proceeds that it receives 
from the Holding Company to support its lending activities and possibly to 
acquire loan participations from other financial institutions. Lincoln Federal 
may also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund the purchase of up to 4% of 
the shares for the RRP which we anticipate will be adopted by our Board 
following the Conversion, subject to shareholder approval, and to repay 
approximately $17.0 million in FHLB advances that mature in December, 1998. 
We anticipate that the balance of the proceeds may be used to purchase mortgage-
backed securities in the secondary market or loan participations from other 
financial institutions. On an interim basis, we may use some of the net proceeds
to invest in short- or intermediate-term U.S. government securities and other 
federal agency securities. See ""Business of Lincoln Federal Savings Bank - 
Investments."" 

The following table shows estimated gross and net proceeds based upon shares of 
Common Stock being sold in the Conversion at the minimum, midpoint, maximum and

(1) In calculating estimated net Conversion proceeds, it has been assumed that 
no sales will be made through selected dealers, that all shares are sold in the 
Subscription Offering, that 70% of the shares of Common Stock are acquired by 
residents of Indiana and 30% are acquired by residents of other states, that 
executive officers and directors of Lincoln Federal and their Associates 
purchase 360,000 shares of Common Stock, that the ESOP acquires 8% of the shares
of Common Stock sold in the Conversion and issued to the Foundation, and that 
200,000 shares of Common Stock are issued to the Foundation. 
(2) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares which 
could occur due to an increase in the Estimated Valuation Range of up to 15% to 
reflect changes in market and financial conditions following the commencement of
the Subscription Offering and the Community Offering, if any. 

The actual net proceeds may differ from the estimated net proceeds calculated 
above for various reasons, including variances in the actual amount of legal and
accounting expenses incurred in connection with the Conversion, commissions paid
for sales made through other dealers, and the actual number of shares of Common 
Stock sold in the Conversion. Any variance in the actual net proceeds from the 
estimates provided in the table above is not expected to be material."

determined until the Offering is completed, it is presently anticipated that the
net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $12.0 million and
$16.4 million (or $19.0 million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by
15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Reorganization and Offering-- Stock Pricing 
and Number of Shares to Be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at 
such amounts. The Company will be unable to utilize any of the net proceeds of 
the Offering until the consummation of the Reorganization. The primary reason 
for conducting the Offering at this time is to have the Company and the Bank 
well positioned for future expansion of the Bank's retail banking franchise and 
to expand operations through acquisitions of other financial institutions, 
branch offices or other financial service companies, although the Company and 
the Bank have no specific expansion or acquisition plans at this time. While the
Bank does not have a specific need to raise additional capital at this time, the
Reorganization will establish a structure that will enable the Bank to compete 
and expend more effectively in the financial services marketplace and that will 
enable the Bank's depositors, employees, management and trustees to obtain an 
equity ownership in the Bank. For further information regarding the reasons for 
conducting the Reorganization and Offering, see ""The Reorganization and Offering
--Description and Reasons for the Reorganization."" 

The Company will contribute approximately 50% of the net proceeds of the 
Offering to the Bank, or approximately $6.0 million to $8.2 million at the 
minimum and maximum of the Offering Range, respectively. The Company and the 
Bank do not have any immediate, specific plans for the investment of the net 
proceeds received in the Offering. Furthermore, neither the Company nor the Bank
have specified any allocations for the net proceeds. The portion of net proceeds
received by the Bank from the Company will be used by the Bank for general 
corporate purposes, including investments in short- and medium-term, investment 
grade debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and marketable equity 
securities and to increase the origination of mortgage, consumer and commercial 
business loans. The Bank may also use such funds for the continued expansion of 
its retail banking franchise and to expand operations through acquisitions of 
other financial institutions, branch offices or other financial services 
companies. To the extent that the stock-based benefit programs that the Company 
intends to adopt subsequent to the Offering are not funded with authorized but 
unissued shares of Common Stock, the Company or Bank may use net proceeds from 
the Offering to fund the purchase of stock to be awarded under such stock 
benefit programs. See ""Risk Factors--Dilutive Effect of Stock Award Plan, Stock 
Option Plan and ESOP"" and ""Management of the Bank--Benefit Plans-- Stock Option 
Plan"" and ""--Stock Award Plan."" 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains to make a 
loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase Common Stock equal to 
8% of the Minority Ownership Interest. Based upon the sale of 1,266,588 shares 
or 1,713,620 shares at the minimum and maximum of the Offering and the 
contribution of between 55,730 shares and 75,399 shares to the Charitable 
Foundation, the amount of the loan to the ESOP would be $1.1 million or $1.4 
million, respectively. See ""Management of the Bank--Report of Independent 
Compensation Consultant--Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust."" The remaining
net proceeds retained by the Company, or $5.0 million to $8.0 million at the 
minimum and adjusted maximum of the Offering Range, respectively, will be 
invested initially in U.S. government and agency securities, short- and medium- 
term debt obligations, mortgage-backed securities and other marketable equity 
securities. 

The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the future
expansion of operations through the acquisition of financial institutions or 
their assets, including those located within the Bank's market area, or 
diversification into other banking related businesses. However, the Company and 
the Bank have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding 
any such transactions. Upon completion of the Reorganization, the Company will 
be a bank holding company, and will be permitted to engage only in those 
activities that are permissible for bank holding companies under the Bank 
Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. See 
""Regulation--Holding Company Regulation"" for a description of certain 
regulations applicable to the Company. Because the Company and the Bank do not 
have any immediate or specific plans for the use of the net proceeds, the 
Company's return on equity will initially be below that of other publicly traded
financial institutions. See ""Risk Factors--Reduced Return on Average Equity 
After the Reorganization--Impact on Common Stock Price"". 

Upon completion of the Reorganization and subject to statutory and regulatory 
requirements, the Board of Directors of the Company will have the authority to 
adopt stock repurchase plans. Pursuant to New York regulations, and without the 
prior approval of the Department, the Company may not repurchase any Common 
Stock in the first year after the Reorganization, and during each of the next 
two following years, may not repurchase more than 5% of its shares outstanding.
Based upon facts and circumstances following completion of the Reorganization 
and subject to applicable regulatory requirements, the board of directors may 
determine to repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may 
include but not be limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the 
price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the 
attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return 
and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/

stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund 

employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which 
repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
In the event the Company determines to repurchase stock, such repurchases may be
 made at market prices which may be in excess of the $10.00 per share purchase 
price in the Offering. Any stock repurchases will be subject to the 
determination of the Company's Board of Directors that both the Company and the 
Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements 
after any repurchases and that such capital will be adequate, taking into 
account, among other things, the level of non-performing and other risk assets, 
the Company's and the Bank's current and projected results of operations and 
asset/liability structure, the economic environment, tax and other 
considerations."

the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $9.0 million 
and $12.3 million (or $14.3 million if the Estimated Price Range is increased by
15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion--Stock Pricing"" as to the 
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Company will be unable to 
utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offerings until the consummation of the 
Conversion. 

The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the 
Association to be issued upon Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net 
proceeds, with the remaining net proceeds to be retained by the Company. 
Based on the midpoint of the Estimated Price Range, the Company expects to 
utilize the $5.3 million of net proceeds to purchase the Common Stock of the 
Association. Such portion of net proceeds will be added to the Association's 
general funds which the Association currently intends to utilize for general 
corporate purposes, including investments in loans, mortgage-related and 
investment securities, and the funding of the Stock-Based Incentive Plan. 
The Association may also use such funds for the expansion of its facilities, 
and to expand operations through acquisitions of other financial institutions, 
branch offices or other financial services companies. Additionally, the 
Association may explore expanding the types of lending products it offers. This 
may be accomplished, in part, by the hiring of a commercial lending officer. 
The Association has not yet determined the approximate amount of net proceeds to
be used for any of the purposes mentioned above. 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to make a loan directly
to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of the Common Stock issued in the 
Conversion, including shares issued to the Foundation. The Company and 
Association may alternatively choose to fund the ESOP's stock purchases through 
a loan by a third-party financial institution. The remaining net proceeds 
retained by the Company will initially be invested in mortgage-related 
securities and federal agency obligations. Based upon the sale of 971,550 shares
or 1,314,450 shares at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated Price Range, and
the issuance of shares to the Foundation, the amount of the loan to the ESOP 
would be $816,000 or $1.1 million, respectively (or $1.3 million if the 
Estimated Price Range is increased by 15%), to be repaid over a 12-year period 
at the prevailing prime rate of interest, which currently is 8.5%. 
See ""Management of the Association--Other Benefit Plans--Employee Stock 
Ownership Plan."" 

The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the future 
expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment of branch
offices and the acquisition of other financial institutions or their assets, 
including those located within the Association's market area or diversification 
into other banking related businesses. The Company has no current arrangements, 
understandings or agreements regarding any such opportunities or transactions. 
The Company, upon the Conversion, will be a unitary savings and loan holding 
company, which under existing laws would generally not be restricted as to the 
types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that the 
Association continues to be a qualified thrift lender (""QTL""). See ""Regulation
--Holding Company Regulation"" for a description of certain regulations 
applicable to the Company. 

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company will 
have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, the Company, pursuant to 
OTS regulations, will be prohibited from repurchasing any shares of Common Stock
for three years except (i) for an offer to all stockholders on a pro rata basis,
or (ii) for the repurchase of qualifying shares of a director. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing and except as provided below, beginning one year following 
completion of the Conversion, the OTS regulations permit the Company to 
repurchase its Common Stock so long as: (i) the repurchases within the following
two years are part of an open-market program not involving greater than 5% of 
its outstanding capital stock during a 12-month period; (ii) the repurchases do 
not cause the Association to become ""undercapitalized"" within the meaning of the
OTS prompt corrective action regulation; and (iii) the Company provides to the 
Regional Director of the OTS no later than 10 days prior to the commencement of 
a repurchase program written notice containing a full description of the 
program to be undertaken and such program is not disapproved by the Regional 
Director. See ""Regulation--Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action."" In addition, 
under current OTS policies, repurchases may be allowed in the first year 
following Conversion and in amounts greater than 5% in the second and third 
years following Conversion provided there are valid and compelling business 
reasons for such repurchases and the OTS approves such repurchases. 

Based upon facts and circumstances following Conversion and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but 
are not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which 
the Common Stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the 
attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return 
and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value 
and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the 
opportunity to improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of 
dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the 
exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and 
(iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best 
interests of the Company and its stockholders. Although the Company has no 
current plans to repurchase its stock, in the event the Company does determine 
to repurchase stock, such repurchases may be made at market prices which may be 
in excess of the Purchase Price in the Conversion. 

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of 
Directors that both the Company and the Association will be capitalized in 
excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and 
that such capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, 
the level of non-performing and other risk assets, the Company's and the 
Association's current and projected results of operations and asset/liability 
structure, the economic environment, tax and other considerations. See ""The 
Conversion--Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After 
Conversion."" 

Additionally, in connection with the Conversion, the Company and Association 
have committed to the OTS that during the one-year period following the 
consummation of the Conversion, the Company will not make any distribution to 
stockholders that, for federal tax purposes, would be treated as a return of 
capital without prior approval of the OTS."

The balance 
will be used to purchase all of the capital stock we will issue in connection 
with the conversion. A portion of the net proceeds to be retained by the 
Company will be lent to our ESOP to fund its purchase of 8% of the shares sold 
in the conversion. On a short-term basis, the balance of the net proceeds 
retained by the Company initially will be invested in short-term investments. 
The net proceeds subsequently may be used to fund acquisitions of other 
financial services institutions or to diversify into non-banking activities, 
although we have no current plans or agreements to do so. Subject to applicable 
regulatory restrictions, the net proceeds may also serve as a source of funds 
for the repurchase of shares or for the payment of dividends to stockholders, 
although the Company has not yet adopted a dividend policy. A portion of the 
net proceeds may also be used to fund the purchase of 4.0% of the shares for 
the MRP, which is anticipated to be adopted following the conversion. See ""Pro 
Forma Data."" 
The funds we receive from the sale of our capital stock to the Company will be 
added to our general funds and be used for general corporate purposes including:
 (i) investment in mortgages and other loans, (ii) U.S. Government and federal 
agency securities, (iii) mortgage-backed securities, or (iv) funding loan 
commitments. However, initially, we intend to invest the proceeds in short-term
 investments until we can deploy the proceeds into higher yielding loans. The 
funds added to our capital will further strengthen our capital position. 

Set forth below is our estimate of the net proceeds from the offering along 
with our estimate of the portion of the net proceeds to be retained by the 
Company. The net proceeds may vary because the total expenses of the conversion 
may be more or less than those estimated. We expect our estimated expenses to 
be $350,000.

The net proceeds will also vary if the number of shares to be issued in the 
conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in our estimated pro forma market 
value. Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit 
accounts with us will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by 
us but will result in a reduction of our liabilities and interest expense as 
funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or accounts. 

For a period of one year following the completion of the conversion, we will 
not pay any dividends that would be construed as a return of capital nor take 
any actions to pursue or propose such dividends."

until the Conversion is completed, it is anticipated that net proceeds from the 
sale of the Common Stock will be between $4.5 million to $6.3 million (or $7.3 
million if the Estimated Price Range is increased by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" 
and ""The Conversion--Stock Pricing"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such
amounts. The Company will be unable to utilize any of the net proceeds of the 
Offerings until the consummation of the Conversion. 

The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank to be
issued upon Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the Offerings.
Based on net proceeds of $4.5 million to $6.3 million, the Company expects to 
utilize between $2.2 million and $3.1 million of net proceeds to purchase the 
common stock of the Bank. Such portion of net proceeds received by the Bank from
the Company will be added to the Bank's general funds which the Bank currently 
intends to utilize for general corporate purposes, including investment in loans
and the repayment of FHLB borrowings. Consistent with its expansion strategy, 
the Bank is actively pursuing establishing a de novo branch location. The Bank 
expects to incur capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 million in 
connection with the establishment of a de novo branch office and relocation of 
its administrative and executive offices. Accordingly, the Bank and the Company 
may use a portion of the Conversion proceeds to fund the establishment of such 
branch office. The Bank has entered into an agreement to purchase a building for
$975,000 for this purpose and expects to open the facility in the Spring of 
1999, subject to zoning approvals. To the extent that the Stock-Based Incentive 
Plan which the Company or the Bank intend to adopt subsequent to the Conversion 
is not funded with authorized but unissued common stock of the Company, the 
Company or Bank may use net proceeds from the Conversion to fund the purchase of
stock to be awarded under such program. See ""Risk Factors--Anti-Takeover 
Provisions Which May Discourage Takeover Attempts-- Employment Contracts and 
Change in Control Payments,"" ""--Possible Dilutive Effect of Stock-Based 
Incentive Plan"" and ""Management of the Bank--Other Benefit Plans--Stock-Based 
Incentive Plan."" The Bank has not yet determined the approximate amount of net 
proceeds to be used for any of the purposes mentioned above. 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains (i.e., 50% 
of the net proceeds, which based on net proceeds of $4.5 million to $6.3 million
will be between $2.2 million and $3.1 million) to capitalize the ESOP Loan 
Subsidiary which intends to loan funds to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to 
purchase 8% of the Common Stock issued in the Conversion, including shares 
issued to the Foundation. Based upon the sale of 504,475, 593,500, 682,525, and 
784,904 shares at the minimum, midpoint, maximum and supermaximum of the 
Estimated Price Range, and the issuance of shares to the Foundation, the amount 
of the loan to the ESOP would be $423,760, $498,540 $573,320 or $659,320, 
respectively, with a term of 10 years at the prevailing prime rate of interest, 
which currently is 8.5%. The Company and Bank may alternatively choose to fund 
the ESOP's stock purchases through a loan by a third party financial institution.
 See ""Management of the Bank--Other Benefit Plans--Employee Stock Ownership 
Plan."" The remaining net proceeds retained by the Company will initially be 
invested in a deposit account at the Bank, which such funds will be used by the 
Bank for general business purposes, including investment in loans, investment-
grade debt securities and the repayment of borrowed funds. 

The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the future 
expansion of operations through the acquisition of savings associations and 
commercial banks or their assets, including those located within the Bank's 
market area, or diversification into other banking related businesses. The 
Company and the Bank have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements 
regarding any such transactions. The Company, upon the Conversion, will be a 
unitary savings and loan holding company, which under existing laws would not

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company will 
have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Unless previously approved, the Company, pursuant to 
applicable regulations, may not repurchase any Common Stock in the first year 
after conversion. If approval is obtained to repurchase common stock during the 
first year after conversion, then such repurchase may not be greater than 5% of 
the capital stock issued. Further, the Company may not repurchase any of its 
Common Stock if the repurchases would cause the Bank to become ""undercapitalized""
within the meaning of the FDIC prompt corrective action regulation. The Company 
has no current intention of implementing a stock repurchase program and any 
determination to do so in the future will depend on the financial condition of 
the Company, market conditions and satisfaction of any applicable laws or 
regulations. See ""Regulation and Supervision--Prompt Corrective Regulatory

cannot be determined until the Reorganization and Stock Issuance is completed, 
it is presently anticipated that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares 
of Common Stock will be between $16.2 million and $22.2 million ($25.6 million 
assuming an increase in the Estimated Offering Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma 
Data"" and ""The Reorganization and Stock Issuance - Stock Pricing and Number of 
Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. 

The Company will purchase all of the capital stock of the Bank to be issued in 
the Reorganization in exchange for 50% of the Reorganization proceeds (net of 
Reorganization-related expenses and the loan to be made to the ESOP), and the 
Company will retain the remaining net proceeds. The Company intends to use a 
portion of the net proceeds to make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the 
ESOP to purchase up to 8% of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Offerings. 
Based upon the issuance of 1,712,750 shares of Common Stock and 2,317,250 shares
of Common Stock at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated Offering Range, 
respectively, the loan to the ESOP would be $1.4 million and $1.9 million, 
respectively. See ""Management - Benefits - Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" 
The remaining net proceeds retained by the Company initially may be used to 
invest in U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various maturities, 
mortgage-backed or other securities, deposits in either the Bank or other 
financial institutions, or a combination thereof. The portion of the net 
proceeds retained by the Company may ultimately be used to support the Bank's 
lending activities, to repay borrowings in the ordinary course to support the 
future expansion of operations through the establishment of additional banking 
offices or other customer facilities or through acquisitions of other financial 
institutions or branch offices (although no such acquisition transactions are 
specifically being considered at this time). The net proceeds from the Offerings
may also be used for other business and investment purposes, including the 
payment of regular or special cash dividends, possible repurchases of the Common
Stock or returns of capital (the Company and the Bank have committed not to take
any action to further the payment of any return of capital on the Common Stock 
during the one-year period subsequent to consummation of the Reorganization). 
Management of the Company expects to consider expanding or diversifying, as such
opportunities become available. 

Following the six-month anniversary of the completion of the Reorganization 
(to the extent permitted by the OTS), and based upon then existing facts and 
circumstances, the Company's Board of Directors may determine to repurchase 
some shares of Common Stock, subject to any applicable statutory and regulatory 
requirements. Such facts and circumstances may include but not be limited to 
(i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in the Company's return on 
equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue 
additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee 
stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases 
would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Any stock 
repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Company's Board of 
Directors that the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable 
regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. 

The portion of the net proceeds used by the Company to purchase the capital 
stock of the Bank will be added to the Bank's general funds to be used for 
general corporate purposes, including increased lending activities and purchases
of securities and to fund potential expenditures for improvements in the Bank's 
technological resources. While the amount of net proceeds received by the Bank 
will further strengthen the Bank's capital position, which already substantially
exceeds all regulatory requirements, it should be noted that the Bank is not 
converting primarily to raise capital. After the Reorganization and Stock 
Issuance, the Bank's tangible capital ratio will be approximately 10.1% (based 
upon the maximum of the Estimated Offering Range). As a result, the Bank will 
be a well-capitalized institution. After the Reorganization and Stock Issuance, 
the Bank intends to emphasize capital strength and growth in assets and earnings. 

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the Reorganization and 
Stock Issuance may be more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will 
also vary if the number of shares to be issued in the Reorganization and Stock 
Issuance is adjusted to reflect a change in the estimated pro forma market value
of the Bank. Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit
accounts at the Bank will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment 
by the Bank but will result in a reduction of the Bank's interest expense and 
liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or other
deposit accounts"

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $87.8 million
and $119.4 million (or $137.7 million if the Estimated Price Range is increased 
by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion--Stock Pricing"" as to the 
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Company will be unable to 
utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offerings until the consummation of the 
Conversion. 

The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank to 
be issued upon Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the 
Offerings, with the remaining net proceeds to be retained by the Company. Based 
on net proceeds of $103.6 million, the Company expects to utilize $51.8 million 
of net proceeds to purchase the common stock of the Bank. Such portion of net 
proceeds will be added to the Bank's general funds. Except as provided herein, 
neither the Bank nor Company have specific plans regarding investment of the 
funds. The Bank currently intends to utilize the funds for general corporate 
purposes, including: investment in loans, particularly residential real estate 
loans, non-residential real estate loans, including commercial real estate loans
in the Bank's primary market area, construction and development loans and 
consumer loans, including home equity loans; investment primarily in U.S. 
Treasury and Agency obligations, including short-term adjustable-rate mortgage-
backed securities; the repayment of FHLB advances; funding of stock-based 
benefit plans; and, to a lesser extent, investment in short-term high quality 
investments, such as highly rated corporate bonds and municipal bonds. 
Management intends to invest the proceeds received to the greatest extent 
possible in investments that will help reduce the Bank's exposure to interest 
rate risk. Management also intends to seek means to expand its products and 
market share. A primary goal of the Bank is to seek opportunities to expand its 
products and services and examine opportunities to expand its facilities and 
operations through acquisitions of other financial institutions, including, 
possibly a commercial bank, branch offices or other financial services 
companies; however, the Bank has no specific acquisition plans at this time. 
See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis--Management Strategy."" Although the 
Bank's capital currently exceeds regulatory requirements (see ""Regulatory 
Capital Compliance""), the Bank is pursuing the mutual-to-stock conversion at 
this time to structure itself in the form used by commercial banks, among other 
financial service companies. Fredericksburg is a rapidly expanding market area 
and management believes converting at this time is important to enable the Bank 
to position itself to take advantage of future expansion opportunities and to 
remain competitive with other companies in its market area that are already in 
the stock form with whom the Bank directly competes. See ""Business of the Bank--
Market Area and Competition"" and ""The Conversion--Purposes of Conversion."" 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains to loan 
funds to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of the Common Stock issued 
in the Conversion, including shares issued to the Foundation. Alternatively, 
the Company and Bank may choose to fund the ESOP's stock purchases through a 
loan by a third-party financial institution. The Company anticipates that the 
remaining net proceeds retained by the Company will initially be invested in 
short-term U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations. Based upon the sale of 
8,976,000 shares or 12,144,000 shares at the minimum and maximum of the 
Estimated Price Range and the issuance of shares to the Foundation, the amount 
of the loan to the ESOP would be $7.8 million or $10.5 million, respectively 
(or $12.1 million if the Estimated Price Range is increased by 15%) to be repaid
approximately over a twenty year period at the prevailing prime rate of 
interest, which currently is 8.0%. At the minimum, midpoint and maximum of the 
Estimated Price Range, total shares issued to the Foundation would be 718,080, 
844,800 and 971,520 shares, with a value of $7,180,800, $8,448,000 and 
$9,715,200, respectively, based upon a per share price of $10.00. 
See ""Management of the Bank--Benefits--Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust."" 

The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the future 
expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment of branch
offices and the acquisition of financial institutions or their assets, including
those located within the Bank's market area, or diversification into other 
banking related businesses. The Company has no current arrangements, 
understandings or agreements regarding any such opportunities or transactions. 
The Company, upon the Conversion, will be a unitary savings and loan holding 
company, which under existing laws would generally not be restricted as to the

Company Regulation"" for a description of certain regulations applicable to the

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company will 
have the authority to conduct stock repurchases, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, the Company, pursuant to 
OTS regulations, will be prohibited from repurchasing any shares of the Common 
Stock for three years except (i) for an offer to all stockholders on a pro rata 
basis, or (ii) for the repurchase of qualifying shares of a director. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided below, beginning one year 
following completion of the Conversion, the OTS regulations permit the Company 
to repurchase its Common Stock so long as: (i) the repurchases within the 
following two years are part of an open-market program not involving greater 
than 5% of its outstanding capital stock during a 12-month period; (ii) the 
repurchases do not cause the Bank to become ""undercapitalized"" within the 
Based upon facts and circumstances following the Conversion and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but 
not be limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which 
the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of
other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved 
in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per 
share of the remaining outstanding shares and the opportunity to improve the 
Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by 
not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or 
to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which
repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Although the Company has no current plans to repurchase its stock, in the event 
the Company does determine to repurchase stock, such repurchases may be made at 
market prices which may be in excess of the Purchase Price in the Conversion. 

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of 
Directors that both the Company and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of 
all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that such 
capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, the level of 
non-performing and other risk assets, the Company's and the Bank's current and 
projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic 
environment, tax and other considerations. See ""The Conversion-- Certain

Stock offered hereby are estimated to be $10.2 million ($11.8 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deduction of 
the underwriting discounts, but before deducting estimated offering expenses 
of $265,000. The Underwriters have agreed to limit the underwriting discounts 
to 1.5% of the public offering price for up to 300,000 shares sold by the 
Underwriters to organizers and executive officers of the Bank or their 
immediate families. If such persons purchase at least 300,000 shares, 
underwriting discounts will bereduced by, and proceeds to the Company will be 
increased by, $165,000. Organizers and executive officers of the Bank have 
provided nonbinding expressions of interest to purchase a total of approximately
335,700 shares. 

The Company expects to contribute approximately $8 million of the net proceeds 
of the offering to the Bank by purchasing all of the Bank's authorized common 
stock. This $8 million is expected to consist of approximately $445,000 
representing the Company's cost for the land it purchased for the Bank's main 
office, and the remainder of the $8 million in cash. This purchase of the Bank's
stock is intended to provide the Bank with the capital required by regulators 
to commence operations, and to support asset growth, fund investments in loans 
and securities, construct the main office, and for general corporate purposes, 
including the purchase of furniture, fixtures and equipment and other necessary 
assets for the Bank's operations and the payment of operating expenses. 
The Company estimates that the Bank's cost for constructing the main office and 
related professional services will be approximately $1.7 million, and that the 
Bank's cost for furniture, fixtures and equipment for the main office will be 
approximately $850,000. 

The remaining net proceeds (plus any net proceeds as a result of the exercise of
the Underwriters' over-allotment option) will initially be used by the Company 
to repay loans made to the Company by members of its Board of Directors to 
finance, on an interim basis, the Company's and the Bank's preopening expenses 
(including the acquisition of the land for the Bank's main office), invested by 
the Company in investment grade securities, and otherwise held by the Company as
working capital for general corporate purposes and to pay operating and other 
expenses, as well as for possible future capital contributions to the Bank. As 
of December 10, 1998, approximately $1,138,000 had been loaned to the Company by
members of the Board of Directors to finance propening expenses, including 
approximately $445,000 for the Company's purchase of the land for the Bank's 
main office. The Company does not expect that additional loans from directors 
will be necessary, and expects that these loans will be repaid promptly 
following completion of the offering. The remaining net proceeds may also be 
available to finance possible acquisitions of other branches or expansion into 
other lines of business closely related to banking, although the Company 
presently has no plans to do so. 

The expected sources and uses of the proceeds from the offering are set forth 
below:

(1) It is anticipated that the net cash proceeds received by the Bank will be 
used to support asset growth, fund investments in loans and securities,

($2.6 million at the midpoint of the Offering Range) will be added to the 
general funds of the Bank and used for general corporate purposes, including 
the origination of loans, funding the construction and/or acquisition costs of 
establishing new branch locations and renovating existing facilities, and 
enhancing future access to capital markets. The Bank has recently purchased a 
second location. The estimated acquisition and renovation costs for the 
building are approximately $600,000. The Stock Company will retain the balance 
of the funds for its initial capitalization, with a portion of those funds 
($282,000 at the midpoint of the Offering Range) being loaned to the ESOP to 
fund its purchase of Common Stock in the Offerings following completion of the 
Offering. Subject to applicable limitations, the Stock Company may also use 
available funds to repurchase shares of Common Stock and for the payment of 
dividends. We expect that, in the interim, we will invest all or part of the 
net proceeds in U.S. Government and Agency securities and other short-term 
investments. 

The total number of shares of the Common Stock to be issued in the 
Reorganization cannot be stated with certainty at this time, because it will 
depend upon the estimated pro forma market value of the Common Stock at the 
time of sale. See ""The Offering -- Stock Pricing and Number of Shares to be 
Issued."" However, the net proceeds to the Company would be approximately 
$3.1 million based upon the assumptions that (i) 352,500 shares of Common Stock
 are sold at a purchase price per share of $10.00 for an aggregate of $3.5 
million (the midpoint of the Offering Range) and (ii) the Offering expenses are 
$418,937 in the aggregate."

Joint ventures and strategic alliances. The Company is presently in discussions

e-commerce and Internet banking joint ventures in 1999. If the Company were to 
successfully conclude agreements with each of these parties, the Company would 
allocate up to $2.5 million of the proceeds of this Offering to the purchase of 
minority interests in such joint ventures. To date, the parties have not reached
any understanding or agreement in connection with such joint ventures. There can
be no assurance that either proposed joint venture will be consummated. See 
""Business -- Strategic Alliances and Joint Ventures."" 

Research and development of ALife product line. The Company expects to use 
approximately $2,250,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering to fund the 
continued research and development of its ALife suite of SmartBot products. 

Marketing and sales. The Company expects to use approximately $1,750,000 to 
market and sell its SmartBot products. The Company intends to use such proceeds 
to establish strategic distribution and marketing relationships and to initiate 
marketing campaigns on all common media to establish recognition of the ALife 
brand. See ""Business -- Marketing and Sales.""

$1,250,000 of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, technologies,
services or products that are complementary to those of the Company. The Company
currently has no understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any 
such acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that such agreements will be 
entered into. 

Expansion of facilities. The Company is aware that it will require additional 
office space due to the planned expansion of the Company, and it expects to use 
approximately $500,000 of the net proceeds for lease expenses and leasehold 
improvements. See ""Business -- Facilities."" 

Addition and expansion of hardware, software and information systems. The 
Company expects that it will use approximately $500,000 of the net proceeds to 
fund the expansion of its hardware, software and information systems in order 
to support its planned growth in personnel. 

Addition of personnel. The Company will need to hire additional staff to 
accomplish its business development goals. Accordingly, the Company anticipates 
using approximately $250,000 of the net proceeds to fund the expansion of its 
employee base. See ""Business -- Employees."" 

General corporate and working capital. The balance of approximately $834,250 
will be used by the Company for general corporate purposes, including working 
capital. 

The foregoing represents the Company's estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of the Offering based upon the present status of its current operations
and anticipated business needs. It is possible, however, that the application of
such funds will differ considerably from the estimates set forth herein due to 
a number of factors, including, the amount of future revenues, the amount of 
cash generated or used by the Company's operations, the progress of the 
Company's sales and marketing efforts, the ability of the Company to enter into 
collaborative arrangements, the success of the Company's recruiting efforts, the
status of competitive products and acquisition opportunities presented to the 
Company. Accordingly, the Company may find it necessary or advisable to 
reallocate some of the proceeds within the categories noted above. Pending the 
aforementioned uses of the proceeds, the Company will invest the proceeds in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments. See ""Risk Factors --
Broad Discretion of Management as to Use of Proceeds."" 

The Company currently believes the net proceeds of the Offering, together with 
the Company's existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and other 
cash generated from operations, will enable the Company to maintain its current 
and planned operations at least through July 2000. There can be no assurance, 
however, that this will be the case. See ""Risk Factors -- Need for Additional

will be used by the Company for general corporate purposes, including working 
capital. 

The foregoing represents the Company's estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of the Offering based upon the present status of its current operations
and anticipated business needs. It is possible, however, that the application of
such funds will differ considerably from the estimates set forth herein due to 
a number of factors, including, the amount of future revenues, the amount of 
cash generated or used by the Company's operations, the progress of the 
Company's sales and marketing efforts, the ability of the Company to enter into 
collaborative arrangements, the success of the Company's recruiting efforts, the
status of competitive products and acquisition opportunities presented to the 
Company. Accordingly, the Company may find it necessary or advisable to 
reallocate some of the proceeds within the categories noted above. Pending the 
aforementioned uses of the proceeds, the Company will invest the proceeds in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments. See ""Risk Factors --
Broad Discretion of Management as to Use of Proceeds."" 

The Company currently believes the net proceeds of the Offering, together with 
the Company's existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and other 
cash generated from operations, will enable the Company to maintain its current 
and planned operations at least through July 2000. There can be no assurance, 
however, that this will be the case. See ""Risk Factors -- Need for Additional 
Capital"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."""

Stock are estimated to be approximately $12.3 million (or $14.2 million if the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting the
 estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company.
The net proceeds of the Offering will be used to retire certain indebtedness of
 the Company, and for additional growth capital which will, among other things,
 enable the Company to expand its operations in the Hattiesburg, Mississippi
 market. Approximately $3.6 million of the net proceeds will be used to retire 
indebtedness of the Company. This indebtedness, which was incurred in December 
of 1996, consists of a variable interest rate loan from a commercial bank, with
 a remaining aggregate principal balance of $3.6 million at September 30, 1998.
 This indebtedness bears interest at the rate of New York Prime less 75 basis 
points and the principal is payable in annual installments of $400,000 with the
 final payment due on December 31, 2006. After giving effect to the sale of the
 shares of Common Stock offered hereby and assuming $3.6 million of the net 
proceeds will be used to retire the above described indebtedness of the Company,
 the Company's pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share would have been 
$.61 for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 and $.63 for the year ended
 December 31, 1997. 

The Company expects to use approximately $3.0 million of the proceeds to
 establish two de novo branches in strategic locations within the City of
 Hattiesburg. This estimate includes the cost of buildings, equipment, vault
 cash and other startup expenditures. This estimate may not reflect actual
 costs. The Bank acquired property in June of 1998 for one of these branches. 

The remaining proceeds, approximately $5.7 million, will be used for the 
possible acquisition of other financial institutions or branches and the
 contribution of additional capital to the Bank to support loan growth. The 
Company currently does not have any commitments or agreements or letters of
 intent for any business acquisitions. Pending application of the net proceeds
 of the Offering, the Company plans to invest them in short-term, investment- 
grade securities, certificates of deposit or guaranteed obligations of the
 United States government."
COMMUNITY SAVINGS BANKSHARES INC /DE/,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/community-savings-bankshares-inc-de-54570-10647,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/community-savings-bankshares-inc-de-54570-10647,424B3,11/6/1998,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=433153,"Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock cannot be 
determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the Conversion Stock will be between $47.3 
million and $64.4 million ($74.2 million assuming an increase in the Estimated 
Valuation Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion - Stock 
Pricing, Exchange Ratio and Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the 
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. 
The Company plans to contribute to the Association 50% of the net Conversion 
proceeds (after deducting therefrom the amounts to be loaned to the ESOP and 
contributed to the 1999 Recognition Plan) and retain the remaining 50% of the 
net proceeds. The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to make 
a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase up to 8% of the 
Conversion Stock sold in the Offerings. Based upon the issuance of 4,871,209 
shares or 6,590,357 shares at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range, respectively, the loan to the ESOP would be $3.9 million and 
$5.3 million, respectively. See ""Management - Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" 
The remaining net proceeds retained by the Company initially may be used to 
invest in investment securities, mortgage-backed and related securities, U.S. 
Government and federal agency securities of various maturities, deposits in 
either the Association or other financial institutions, or a combination 
thereof. The portion of the net proceeds retained by the Company may ultimately 
be used to support the Association's lending activities, to support the future 
expansion of operations, and for other business and investment purposes, 
including the payment of regular or special cash dividends, possible 
repurchases of the Common Stock or returns of capital (the Company and the 
Association have committed that no return of capital will be made on the Common 
Stock during the one-year period subsequent to consummation of the Conversion) 
or the development of new branch office locations. The Association has acquired 
or placed deposits for four parcels of real estate which may be used for new 
branch offices over the next three years. Other than as previously disclosed 
herein, neither the Association nor the Company has any specific plans, 
arrangements, or understandings regarding any branch acquisitions or 
diversification of activities at this time. 

Following the completion of the Conversion (to the extent permitted by the OTS),
 and based upon then existing facts and circumstances, the Company's Board of 
Directors may determine to repurchase some shares of Common Stock, subject to 
any applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Such facts and 
circumstances may include but not be limited to: (i) market and economic 
factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in the market, the 
volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms 
of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment, the ability to 
increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding 
shares, and an improvement in the Company's return on equity; (ii) the 
avoidance of dilution to shareholders by not having to issue additional shares 
to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans;
 and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be deemed in the 
best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Any stock repurchases will 
be subject to the determination of the Company's Board of Directors that the 
Association will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory 
requirements after any such repurchases. As of the date hereof, the Company has 
not made my determination with regard to implementation of a stock repurchase 
program subsequent to the Conversion. The payment of dividends or repurchase of 
stock, however, would be prohibited if the Association's net worth would be 
reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account to be established 
for the benefit of Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account 
Holders. As of the date of this Prospectus, the initial balance of the 
liquidation account would be approximately $50.8 million. See ""Dividend Policy,""
 ""The Conversion Liquidation Rights"" and ""The Conversion Certain Restrictions 
on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After the Conversion."" 
The Company will be a unitary savings and loan holding company which, under 
existing laws, would generally not be restricted as to the types of business 
activities in which it may engage, provided that the Association continues to 
be a qualified thrift lender (""QTL""). See ""Regulation - The Company"" for a 
description of certain regulations applicable to the Company. 

The portion of the net proceeds contributed by the Company to the Association 
will be added to the Association's general funds to be used for general 
corporate purposes, including increased lending activities and purchases of 
securities. While the amount of net proceeds received by the Association will 
further strengthen the Association's capital position, which already 
substantially exceeds all regulatory requirements, it should be noted that the 
Association is not converting primarily to raise capital. After the Conversion, 
the Association's tangible capital ratio will be 12.5% (based upon the midpoint 
of the Estimated Valuation Range). As a result, the Association will continue 
to be a well-capitalized institution. After the Conversion, the Association 
intends to emphasize capital strength and growth in assets and earnings. 

THE NET PROCEEDS MAY VARY BECAUSE TOTAL EXPENSES OF THE CONVERSION MAY BE MORE 
OR LESS THAN THOSE ESTIMATED. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of 
shares to be issued in the Conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in the 
estimated pro forma market value of the Common Stock. Payments for shares made 
through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at the Association will not 
result in the receipt of new funds for investment by the Association but will 
result in a reduction of the Association's interest expense and liabilities as 
funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or other deposit 
accounts."

in full), at the initial public offering price of $12.50 and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by the Company. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. The primary purposes of the Offering

activities, approximately $5.0 million for expanded professional services 
capabilities (primarily increased staffing for consulting customer support and 
training services) and approximately $11.0 million to increase its domestic and 
international sales and marketing capabilities. The Company has no other 
specific plans as to the use of the net proceeds from the Offering. The Company 
may also use a portion of the net proceeds for possible acquisitions of 
businesses, products and technologies or the establishment of joint ventures 
that are complementary to the current and future business of the Company. 
Although the Company has not identified any specific businesses, products or 
technologies that it may acquire, and there are no current agreements or 
understandings with respect to any such transactions, the Company does from time
to time evaluate such opportunities. Pending such uses, the net proceeds of the

net proceeds of the Offering. Future events, as well as changes in economic, 
regulatory or competitive conditions or in the Company's business and the 
results of its activities, may make changes in the allocation of funds within 
the described categories or to other purposes necessary or desirable.

($9.8 million if the Underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full),
from which the Company will use approximately $2.6 million to repay debt and
contribute $1 to $2 million immediately to the capital of the Bank. That will
leave approximately $4 to $5 million of net proceeds at the Company level
(assuming $1 to $2 million are initially contributed to the Capital of the
Bank). It is currently anticipated that approximately $600,000 of the net
proceeds from the Offerings will likely be used by the Bank and/or the Company
to fund the cost of acquiring a currently vacant bank branch building and
establishing a new branch for the Bank.

     The Company currently anticipates using the remaining approximately $4 to
$5 million of net proceeds in principally two different ways. First, the Company
will make capital contributions to the Bank from time to time to support further
internal growth and to finance opening new branches, whether by acquisition or
establishment of de novo branches. Other than the aforereferenced branch that
the Bank anticipates spending $600,000 to establish, the Company currently does
not have any agreements in place or definitive plans to open additional
branches. However, the Company has in the past and will continue in the future
to evaluate additional branch locations in Pinellas County, Florida. The
Company's five year business plan contemplates the Bank opening approximately
one new branch each year. However, there can be no assurance that such goal will
be met or not be changed in the future.

     The second use of the remaining proceeds from the Offerings will be to
acquire, make investments in or establish various ancillary businesses. The
Company continuously evaluates opportunities to add to the Company's noninterest
income. In the past, that led to the establishment of United Trust, the
Company's trust business, as well as the acquisition of EPW, the Company's
investment advisory business. The Company currently has no agreements or
definitive plans to expand into any particular ancillary business. However, the
Company recently retained the services of a consultant to explore the
possibility of the Company making a minority investment either in an existing
business or in a new business that would engage in the property casualty
underwriting insurance business in Florida. The consultant's work is ongoing and
it recently recommended to the Company that it consider making a minority
investment in a newly established entity to engage in such a business and seek
third party investors to complete the financing of such business venture. The
consultant suggested that such entity should have at least $6 million of
capital. The Company does not yet know if any such third party investors will be
interested in any such opportunity, or whether the Company will ultimately
determine to pursue such opportunity. The consultant's efforts will be on going.
Other than such consultant, the Company has not retained anyone to engage in any
other exploratory evaluations on behalf of the Company. The Company's efforts to
pursue additional various potential additional sources of non-interest income
will continue into the future. However, the Company currently has no agreements
or definitive plans to expand into any particular ancillary business. If the
Company decides to pursue a specific opportunity, the proceeds from the
offerings will be available to finance such efforts.

     In evaluating whether to go public, the Company considered a variety of
factors, including the costs associated with undertaking and completing a public
offering, the potential need for additional capital in the future for further
branch and other Bank expansion, the number of holders of the Preferred
Securities and Common Stock that are needed to list the securities on NASDAQ's
SmallCap Market and the Company's underwriter's recommendation of the minimum
outstanding amount of Preferred Securities and Common Stock needed to provide
some liquidity for the secondary market. To address those issues, the Company
determined it was appropriate to pursue the specific type and size securities
offerings set forth herein, rather than pursue separate offerings from time to
time in the future when there may be a specific pressing need for capital. As
the amount of capital that will need to be contributed to the Bank over time or
be available to invest in ancillary businesses is not currently known, nor the
timing of the needs for such capital, the Company has determined that it will
leave the remaining net proceeds at the Company level. This will permit the
Company in the future to contribute capital to the Bank from time to time as
needed or invest in existing or future ancillary businesses. Such net proceeds
will initially be invested by the Company in short-term obligations."

William O. Hunt, a director of the Company, and the pledge of all assets of the 
Company. See ""Certain Transactions"" and Notes 4, 5 and 6 of Notes to Financial 
Statements. 

(2) Such funds could be used for a variety of general corporate purposes, 
including, without limitation, further marketing efforts and infrastructure 
improvements. 

The Company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions, and to identify and 
have preliminary discussions with potential acquisition candidates, although 
there are, as of the date of this Prospectus, no agreements, arrangements or 
understandings between the Company and any party relating thereto. 

Pending the above uses of proceeds, the Company intends to invest the net 
proceeds of this Offering in short-term bank deposits or investment-grade 
securities. The foregoing represents the Company's current intentions with 
respect to the allocation of the proceeds of this Offering based upon its
