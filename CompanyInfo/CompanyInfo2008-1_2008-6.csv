approximately $39.2 million, or approximately $45.7 million if the underwriters
exercise their overallotment option in full, after deducting underwriting
discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by us.

      As of the date of this prospectus, we anticipate using the net proceeds
from this offering as follows:

•  approximately $2 million to develop and expand our test preparation solutions
   business;                                                  
    
•  approximately $2 million to license course content from IT vendors to expand 
   our degree major and single course program offerings;         
    
•  approximately $1 million for marketing costs related to enhancing our “ATA” 
   brand; and                                                     
    
•  the balance to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes,
   including incremental costs associated with being a public company, and for 
   acquisitions of or investments in other businesses, products or technologies
   that we believe are complementary to our own business or that otherwise 
   extend our business or brand. We do not currently have any agreements or 
   understandings to make any material acquisitions of, or investments in, other 
   businesses.                

      The industries in which we operate are evolving rapidly which could cause
significant and rapid changes to our strategies and business plans. The
foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering based upon our present plans
and business conditions, but our management will have broad flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds from this offering. The occurrence of
new business opportunities, unforeseen events or changed business conditions may
result in application of the proceeds from this offering in a manner other than
as described in this prospectus.

      To the extent that a certain portion or all of the net proceeds we receive
from this offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend
to invest our net proceeds in short-term, investment grade, debt securities or
to deposit the proceeds into interest-bearing bank accounts. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a PFIC for
U.S. federal income taxpayers, which could result in negative tax consequences
to you."
CASCAL N.V.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cascal-nv-766561-57313,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cascal-nv-766561-57313,424B4,1/29/2008,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=5677854,"We estimate that the proceeds received by us from this offering, after deducting
underwriting discounts and before deducting the estimated offering expenses
payable by us, will be approximately $97.2 million, at the initial public
offering price of $12.00 per share.
 
We will use these proceeds as follows:
 
•  £38.0 million ($77.4 million) for the repayment of debt originally incurred by
   us in June 2006 in connection with Biwater’s acquisition of our shares from   
   Nuon; and                                                                     
  
•  $19.8 million for the acquisition and/or development of projects, for general 
   working capital purposes and for the payment of the estimated balance of      
   expenses from this offering. In addition, Biwater has also agreed to reimburse
   us for its share of the offering expenses based on the number of shares sold  
   by Biwater compared to the total size of this offering.                 

We will therefore have total additional cash available to us from the offering
for the acquisition and/or development of projects and general working capital
purposes in the amount of $20.1 million as shown below (dollars in millions):

The debt to be repaid with the proceeds of this offering is due and payable on
June 20, 2008 and bears interest at rates of U.K. LIBOR plus 2.75% until
December 20, 2007, and U.K. LIBOR plus 3.5% from December 20, 2007 until
maturity.
 
Pending the application of the net proceeds of this offering as described above,
we plan to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing accounts at international
financial institutions.
 
Other than the reimbursement of the offering expenses referred to above, we will
not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
shareholder.
 
Amounts used in this prospectus that are taken or derived from our financial
statements and that have been translated into one currency from another currency
have been translated in the manner described in Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements. Unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires,
all other currency translations in this prospectus have been made using exchange
rates as of September 30, 2007."

approximately $107.5 million, or approximately $116.1 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this
offering for the following purposes:

• approximately $70 million to expand our solar wafer manufacturing facilities 
  and purchase additional equipment for our wafer capacity expansion plan in 
  2008; we believe such amount will cover approximately 75% of the anticipated 
  financing for our 2008 wafer expansion plan;       

• approximately $35 million to invest in polysilicon manufacturing production in 
  2008; we believe that such amount will cover approximately 26% of the 
  anticipated investment amount for polysilicon manufacturing production in 
  2008; and                                                   

• the remaining amount to pay or prepay for raw materials and for other general
  corporate purposes.                                               

The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and allocate the net
proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business conditions.
We believe the net proceeds from this offering together with our anticipated
cash flow from our operations and borrowings from our existing bank facilities
will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for our expansion plans in
2008. Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion
to apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.

Since we are an offshore holding company, we will need to make capital
contributions and loans to our PRC subsidiaries such that the net proceeds of
the offering can be used in the manner described above. Such capital
contributions and loans are subject to a number of limitations and approval
processes under PRC laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that we can
obtain the approvals from the relevant governmental authorities, or complete the
registration and filing procedures required to use our net proceeds as described
above, in each case on a timely basis, or at all. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders."

(1)       A portion of the offering expenses have been pre-funded with the proceeds of a   
          $250,000 note from our sponsor, as described below. This note will be repaid out 
          of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account upon the  
          closing of this offering.                                                        
   
(2)       The underwriters have agreed to defer $25,920,000 of their underwriting

          which equals 3.24% of the gross proceeds of this offering, until consummation of 
          our business combination. Upon consummation of our business combination, the     
          amount of the underwriters’ deferred commissions is reduced pro-ratably by the   
          exercise of stockholder conversion rights and will be paid to the underwriters   
          from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be        
          released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of  
          the business or businesses with which our business combination occurs, general   
          corporate purposes, payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in 
          connection with our business combination, to fund the purchases of other         
          companies or for working capital.                                                
   
(3)       Does not include a portion of the legal fees, $250,000, related to the offering  
          that is being deferred and will be paid, without contingency, from interest      
          income earned from the trust account released to us for working capital purposes.

(5)       Does not include a portion of the estimated printing and engraving expenses,     
          $100,000, related to the offering that is being deferred and is expected to be   
          paid from interest income earned from the trust account released to us for       
          working capital purposes.                                                        
   
(6)       The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $500,000 even if
          the over-allotment option is exercised. In addition, up to $9,500,000 of income  
          earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us to pay   
          for our working capital requirements. For purposes of presentation, the full     
          amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to 
          us immediately following the offering. In addition, amounts required to pay      
          income taxes may be drawn from the trust account prior to the business           
          combination.                                                                     
   
(7)       These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items 
          may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater
          legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with      
          negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of       
          complexity of that business combination. We do not anticipate any change in our  
          intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of
          allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current        
          estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our      
          excess working capital. We do not expect to require more than $10,000,000 to fund
          our working capital requirements prior to our business combination.              
   
(8)       Assumes our stockholders have not approved an extension of the time period in    
          which we may consummate a business combination from 24 to up to 30 months as     
          described in this prospectus. If our stockholders approve such an extension, we  
          could incur up to $300,000 ($10,000 per month for up to 30 months) for the       
          administrative fee payable to Trian Fund Management, L.P.                        

Of the net proceeds of this offering, $752,700,000 (or $865,800,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $10,000,000 from
the purchase of sponsor warrants, for an aggregate of $762,700,000 (or
$875,800,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
will be placed in a trust account maintained by Wilmington Trust Company, as
trustee. In addition, $25,920,000 (or $29,808,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ deferred discount will be deposited into such trustee account for
a total amount in trust of $788,620,000 (or $905,608,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full). The proceeds will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of a business
combination or as part of any liquidation of our trust account. To the extent
the trust account earns income or we are deemed to have earned income in
connection therewith, we will be permitted to seek disbursements from the trust
account to pay any federal, state or local income taxes, franchise taxes or
other tax obligations in respect of the trust account. The proceeds held in the
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we consummate a business combination (net of taxes and
amounts disbursed to us for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of
the underwriters’ deferred discount held in trust, less any amounts payable to
stockholders exercising conversion rights). Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business will be used to finance our
operations, which may include the target business(es) we acquired on the
consummation of the business combination, for maintenance or expansion of
operations of a target business(es), the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in consummating our business combination, to effect other
acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board of directors at
that time. We may use any remaining proceeds held in the trust account for
working capital, including director and officer compensation, change-in-control
payments or payments to affiliates, to pay finder’s fees, finance the operations
of the target business, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategy.
All amounts held in the trust account that are not converted to cash or released
to us as income, net of income taxes, will be released on closing of our
business combination with a target having a fair market value of at least 80% of
our net assets held in trust (net of taxes and up to $9,500,000 disbursed to us
for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of the underwriters’
deferred discount held in trust) at the time of such business combination. The
ability of a larger number of our stockholders to exercise their conversion
rights may not allow us to consummate the most desirable business combination or
optimize our capital structure.

We intend to use the $500,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust for
due diligence, legal and accounting fees and expenses of the acquisition
including investment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring and
negotiating a business combination, as well as a possible down payment, “reverse
break-up fee” (a payment to the target business under a merger agreement if the
financing for an acquisition is not obtained), to fund a lock-up or “no-shop”
provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses
from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more
favorable to such target businesses) and, if necessary, to bear the costs of
liquidation in the event we are unable to consummate a business combination
within 24 months from the date of this prospectus. While we do not have any
current intention to use these funds as a down payment or reverse break-up fee 
or to fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular proposed business
combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we paid for 
the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would
be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined 
based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our 
available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result 
of our breach or for other reasons), if the amount were large enough and we had 
already used up the other funds available to us, could result in our not having 
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with 
respect to, potential target businesses. In such case, if we were unable to 
secure additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business 
combination in the allotted time and be forced to liquidate. In addition to the 
use of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay 
fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business.

We believe that the income earned on the trust account will be sufficient to
cover the foregoing expenses. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due
diligence will most likely be undertaken only after we have negotiated and
signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the
terms of our business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our business combination is
less than the actual amount of such costs, we may be required to raise
additional funds, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. To the extent that such expenses exceed the amounts not held in
the trust account and the income of up to $9,500,000 that may be released to us
from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by
us unless we consummate a business combination. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no current ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to present management after
our business combination. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such
combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of the out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed prior to the
consummation of the business combination. If the target business’s owners do not
agree to such repayment, this could cause our officers and directors to view
such potential business combination unfavorably and result in a conflict of
interest. We have adopted a policy that, prior to the consummation of a business
combination, none of our existing officers, directors or sponsor, or any entity
with which they are affiliated, will be paid, either by us or a target business,
any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation for any services they
render in order to effectuate the consummation of a business combination, other
than (i) the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, (ii) the monthly fee of
$10,000 payable to Trian Fund Management, L.P. and (iii) by virtue of their
ownership of sponsor units, sponsor warrants or any securities included in or
issuable upon exercise of such securities.

With respect to finder’s fees, we do not currently anticipate that we would
enter into any arrangement that would require us to pay a finder’s fee prior to
the consummation of a business combination. If such a business combination is
consummated, it is possible that a portion of the funds held in trust, once
released, will be utilized to pay such finder’s fees. Even if such a business
combination is not consummated, it is possible that we would incur an obligation
to an individual or an entity to pay them either a finder’s fee and/or to
reimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provide to us. We
would anticipate such fees or expenses being paid from the funds held outside of
the trust account (including up to $9,500,000 of income earned on the amounts
held in trust disbursed to us for working capital purposes). If we are unable to
consummate a business combination and we liquidate, Trian Fund Management, L.P.
will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced
if we did not obtain a waiver from vendors, service providers, or other entities
that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products
sold to us, as well as any prospective target businesses for fees and expenses
of third parties that we agree in writing to pay in the event we do not
consummate a combination with such target business. Consequently, if we incur an
obligation to an individual or an entity to pay them either a finder’s fee
and/or to reimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provide
to us, such an individual or entity has not signed a waiver of their right to
obtain funds from the trust account, we do not ultimately consummate a business
combination and we do not have sufficient funds to pay such fees or expenses
from the funds held outside of the trust account or that may be released from 
the trust account, Trian Fund Management, L.P. will be liable for such fees and 
expenses.

To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or in
part as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event that
indebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as consideration
to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account that
are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third party
indebtedness is used as consideration, none of our officers or directors or our
sponsor would be personally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is
less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the
consideration with our capital stock or debt. In such event, the proceeds held
in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used
to finance our operations, which may include the target business(es) that we
acquire in the business combination, for maintenance or expansion of operations
of a target business(es), the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in consummating our business combination, to effect other
acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our management or board
of directors at that time. We may use these funds, among other things, for
director and officer compensation, change-in-control payments or payments to
affiliates, to finance the operations of the target business, to make other
acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy.

Our sponsor has made a $250,000 loan to us to fund a portion of the offering
expenses owed by us to third parties. The loan bears no interest and the
principal balance is repayable on the earlier of (i) the date of the
consummation of this offering and (ii) September 30, 2008. The principal balance
is prepayable without penalty at any time in whole or in part. The proceeds from
the loan have been used to pay organizational and offering expenses.

The proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in United
States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act. Although the rate of interest to be earned on the trust
account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust account, and although
we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will take to consummate a
business combination, we anticipate the interest that will accrue on the trust
account during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an
acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. By
restricting the holdings in the trust account to these instruments, we believe
that we will not be deemed an investment company within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act. Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to
comply with the requirements of the Investment Company Act, we will not
liquidate and distribute the trust account to holders of our common stock
included in the units being sold in this offering until after our existence
terminates by operation of law on 24 months (or up to 30 months if extended
pursuant to a stockholder vote as described in this prospectus) from the date of
this prospectus and, consequently, we may be deemed to be an investment company
and thus required to comply with such act. The income derived from the holdings
in the trust account during this period that is not otherwise returned to public
stockholders who vote against a business combination will be used to defray our
general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is consummated. We do not believe that the fees and
expenses for due diligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, down payment,
lock-up, reverse break-up fee or other activities related to this offering or
our business combination will exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate, comprised of
$500,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust plus up to $9,500,000 of
income earned on the amounts held in trust and disbursed to us for working
capital purposes. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will
have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months (or
up to 30 months if extended pursuant to a stockholder vote as described in this
prospectus), assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that
time.

We intend to pay Trian Fund Management, L.P., a company affiliated with our
sponsor, a monthly fee of $10,000 for general and administrative services
including office space and administrative, technology and secretarial services.
This arrangement is expected to be agreed to by Trian Fund Management, L.P. for
our benefit and is not intended to provide our officers or directors
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on fees for similar services
in the New York metropolitan area, that the fee expected to be charged by Trian
Fund Management, L.P. is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon consummation of our
business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
stockholders on a pro rata basis.

A public stockholder (but not our sponsor, our officers and directors, our other
current stockholders or their permitted transferees with respect to the common
stock included in the sponsor units) will be entitled to receive funds from the
trust account (including income earned on such stockholder’s portion of the
trust account, net of taxes payable and amounts disbursed to us for working
capital purposes) only in the event of our liquidation of the trust account as
part of our liquidation upon our failure to consummate a business combination,
or if such public stockholder exercises his conversion rights in connection with
a business combination that the public stockholder voted against and that we
actually consummate or an extension of the time period within which we must
consummate our business combination that the public stockholder voted against
and that was approved. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Our sponsor, our
officers and directors, our other current stockholders and their permitted
transferees are not entitled to convert any of their shares of common stock
acquired prior to this offering into a pro rata share of the trust account.

Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ deferred discount held in trust excluding any income earned
thereon, net of the pro rata amount of the underwriters’ deferred discount paid
to stockholders who properly exercise their conversion rights. In the event that
we are unable to consummate a business combination and the trustee is forced to
liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed that the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ deferred discount will be distributed on a pro
rata basis among the public stockholders along with any income earned thereon
(net of taxes thereon)."

(1)   Approximately $125,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC          
      registration fee, the FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the   
      American Stock Exchange filing fee, and a portion of the legal and audit    
      fees, have been or will be paid from the funds we received from             
      Messrs. Hauslein and Burman described below. These funds will be repaid out 
      of the proceeds of this offering available to us and the interest on such   
      proceeds available to us.                                                   
   
(2)   No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
      insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts  
      are reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation 
      of the offering. An additional $8,955,000, or $10,298,250 if the 
      over-allotment option is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited 
      in trust following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the 
      underwriters only if and when we consummate a business combination.     
   
(3)   The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $150,000   
      even if the over-allotment option is exercised. In addition, $3,500,000 of  
      interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be     
      available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of
      presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount  
      of net proceeds available to us immediately following this offering.        
   
(4)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these  
      items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may   
      incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in   
      connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based    
      upon the level of complexity of that business combination. In addition, we  
      may encounter expenses that do not fit precisely within one of these        
      categories. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
      other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
      which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
      specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working    
      capital.                                                                    
 
In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, James N. Hauslein,
Gaurav V. Burman, Sir Peter Burt, Michael T. Biddulph, Michael W. Burt, and
Promethean plc have committed to purchase, using their own funds or through
wholly owned entities, the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of
$5,800,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a private placement
basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will not pay any
discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider warrants.
All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in the trust
account described below.
 
$194,200,000, or $223,443,250 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of the proceeds from this offering, plus the $5,800,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Bank of
America, maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts
and commissions potentially payable to the underwriters in this offering. The
underwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we
consummate a business combination and have waived their right to receive such
payment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business
combination. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) interest
earned on the funds in the trust account up to $3,500,000 to fund expenses
related to investigating and selecting a target business and our other working
capital requirements and (ii) interest earned on the funds in the trust account
for any amounts we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations, the
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.
 
The payment to Hauslein & Company, an affiliate of James N. Hauslein, our
chairman of the board and chief executive officer, of a monthly fee of $10,000
is for certain administrative, technology, and secretarial services, as well as
the use of certain limited office space. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Hauslein & Company for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Hauslein
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services, that the fee charged by Hauslein & Company is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the
$10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s,
consulting, or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers,
directors, stockholders, special advisors, or any of their affiliates, prior to,
or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as searching for 
and identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
potential target businesses and business combinations, as well as traveling to
and from the offices, plants, or similar locations of prospective target
businesses to examine their operations or meet with their representatives or
owners. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not
held in trust and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting, and other
third-party expenses attendant to the search for target businesses and to the
due diligence investigation, structuring, and negotiation of a business
combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses by our officers,
directors, and existing stockholders,” and “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation
obligations, and reserves.” There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket
expenses that could be incurred. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.
 
Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be $150,000. In addition, (i) interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account, up to $3,500,000, plus (ii) interest earned on
the funds in the trust account for any amounts needed to pay our income or other
tax obligations, may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements.
We will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to
use the excess working capital (approximately $710,000) for director and officer
liability insurance premiums (approximately $200,000), with the balance of
$590,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting,
and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed
our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the
funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to
consultants to assist us with our search for a target business, or as a down
payment, “reverse break-up fee” (a provision in a merger agreement which
requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition is
not obtained), or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of
intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” for transactions with
other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect
to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any
current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid
for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that
would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds, whether
as a result of our breach or otherwise, could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, potential target businesses.
 
The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above-described categories.
 
We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. Additionally, while we are not obligated
to engage any of the underwriters to assist us with locating a target business
following this offering, we are not restricted from doing so. If we did, we may
pay a fee to them for their services for assisting us in locating a target
business. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account that are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed
to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not
expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions, and for marketing, research, and development of existing or new
products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or
finders’ fees that we incur prior to the completion of our business combination 
if the funds available to us outside of the trust account are insufficient to
cover such expenses.
 
To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, James N. Hauslein and Gaurav V. Burman have
agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to
seek repayment of such expenses.
 
James N. Hauslein, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and
Promethean Investments LLP have each advanced to us $75,000 (for a total of
$150,000) which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee,
the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, and a
portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans will be payable, at
5% interest per year, within 60 days of the consummation of this offering. The
loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for
payment of offering expenses.
 
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds, including amounts that may be released to us from the trust
account, to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination
is not consummated during that time.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account,
including interest earned on his, her, or its portion of the trust account, only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts its
shares into cash in connection with a business combination that the public
stockholder voted against and that we consummate. In no other circumstances will
a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.
 
Upon the consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters will
be entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust account
attributable to the underwriting discounts and commissions held in the trust
account excluding any accrued interest thereon. In the event that we are unable
to consummate a business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the
trust account, the underwriters have agreed that: (i) they will forfeit any
rights or claims to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon, and (ii) the
proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ discount will be distributed on a
pro-rata basis among the public stockholders along with any accrued interest
thereon."

the 3,300,000 shares of common stock offered by us in this offering, based upon
an initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

•   to repay $14.1 million of our debt outstanding under our Comerica Facility,
    $2.5 million of which was outstanding on September 30, 2007; and           

•   the balance for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of

Since August 1, 2006, we borrowed $15.2 million of debt under our Comerica
Facility, which was used to finance the acquisitions of physician practices,
related earn-out payments, and for general corporate purposes. Of this amount,
$11.6 million was borrowed from October 1, 2007 to January 11, 2008. Borrowings
under the Comerica Facility bear interest at a rate, based on either LIBOR plus
1.5% to 2.0%, or the lender’s prime rate plus 0% to 0.25%, as selected by us for
each advance. Outstanding amounts advanced to us are repayable on or before the
revolving maturity date of April 1, 2008. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling
stockholders. To the extent the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option, we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of over-allotment

the Fund, through the Master Fund, to engage in the trading of exchange-traded
futures on the Index Commodities with a view to reflecting the performance of
the Index over time, less the expenses of the operations of the Fund and the
Master Fund. The Master Fund’s portfolio also will include United States
Treasury securities for deposit with the Master Fund’s Commodity Broker as
margin and other high credit quality short-term fixed income securities.

   To the extent that the Master Fund trades in futures contracts on United
States exchanges, the assets deposited by the Master Fund with its Commodity
Broker as margin must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC.
Such segregated funds may be invested only in a limited range of instruments —
principally U.S. government obligations.

   Although the percentages set forth below may vary substantially over time, as
of the date of this Prospectus, the Master Fund estimates:

   (i) up to approximately 10% of the net asset value of the Master Fund will be
placed in segregated accounts in the name of the Master Fund with the Commodity
Broker (or another eligible financial institution, as applicable) in the form of
cash or United States Treasury bills to margin commodity positions. Such funds
will be segregated pursuant to CFTC rules;

   (ii) approximately 90% of the net asset value of the Master Fund will be
maintained in segregated accounts in the name of the Master Fund in bank
deposits or United States Treasury and United States Government Agencies issues.

     Meridian Interstate Bancorp intends to invest the proceeds it retains from
the offering in short-term, liquid investments, such as U.S. treasury and
government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and cash and cash
equivalents, in order to supplement the interest income of East Boston Savings
Bank and increase consolidated interest income. The actual amounts to be
invested in different instruments will depend on the interest rate environment
and Meridian Interstate Bancorp’s liquidity requirements. In the future,
Meridian Interstate Bancorp may sell some or all of its investments and use the
proceeds of those sales:
                                                                                  
• to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory restrictions;

     Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks regulations restrict stock repurchases
by Meridian Interstate Bancorp within three years of the offering unless the
repurchase: (i) is part of a general repurchase made on a pro rata basis
pursuant to an offering approved by the Commissioner of the Banks and made to 
all stockholders of Meridian Interstate Bancorp (other than Meridian Financial 
Services with the approval of the Commissioner of Banks); (ii) is limited to the 
repurchase of qualifying shares of a director; (iii) is purchased in the open 
market by a tax-qualified or nontax-qualified employee stock benefit plan of 
Meridian Interstate Bancorp or East Boston Savings Bank in an amount
reasonable and appropriate to fund the plan; or (iv) is limited to stock
repurchases of no greater than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of Meridian
Interstate Bancorp where compelling and valid business reasons are established
to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Banks. In addition, pursuant to
Federal Reserve Board approval conditions imposed in connection with the
formation of Meridian Interstate Bancorp, Meridian Interstate Bancorp has
committed (i) to seek the Federal Reserve Board’s prior approval before
repurchasing any equity securities from Meridian Financial Services and (ii)
that any repurchases of equity securities from stockholders other than Meridian
Financial Services will be at the current market price. Meridian Interstate
Bancorp will also be subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s notice provisions
for stock repurchases.

     East Boston Savings Bank initially intends to invest the proceeds it
receives from the offering, which is shown in the table above as the amount
contributed to East Boston Savings Bank, in short-term, liquid investments. Over
time, East Boston Savings Bank may use the proceeds that it receives from the
offering:

          developing new branch locations; and

     Meridian Interstate Bancorp intends to invest the proceeds it retains from
the offering in short-term, liquid investments, such as U.S. treasury and
government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and cash and cash
equivalents, in order to supplement the interest income of East Boston Savings
Bank and increase consolidated interest income. The actual amounts to be
invested in different instruments will depend on the interest rate environment
and Meridian Interstate Bancorp’s liquidity requirements. In the future,
Meridian Interstate Bancorp may sell some or all of its investments and use the
proceeds of those sales:
                                                                                  
• to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory restrictions;                                                           
                                                                                  
• to finance the possible acquisition of financial service companies or their 
  assets; and                                                       
                                                                                  
• for general corporate purposes.                                         


     Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks regulations restrict stock repurchases
by Meridian Interstate Bancorp within three years of the offering unless the
repurchase: (i) is part of a general repurchase made on a pro rata basis
pursuant to an offering approved by the Commissioner of the Banks and made to 
all stockholders of Meridian Interstate Bancorp (other than Meridian Financial 
Services with the approval of the Commissioner of Banks); (ii) is limited to the 
repurchase of qualifying shares of a director; (iii) is purchased in the open 
market by a tax-qualified or nontax-qualified employee stock benefit plan of 
Meridian Interstate Bancorp or East Boston Savings Bank in an amount
reasonable and appropriate to fund the plan; or (iv) is limited to stock
repurchases of no greater than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of Meridian
Interstate Bancorp where compelling and valid business reasons are established
to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Banks. In addition, pursuant to
Federal Reserve Board approval conditions imposed in connection with the
formation of Meridian Interstate Bancorp, Meridian Interstate Bancorp has
committed (i) to seek the Federal Reserve Board’s prior approval before
repurchasing any equity securities from Meridian Financial Services and (ii)
that any repurchases of equity securities from stockholders other than Meridian
Financial Services will be at the current market price. Meridian Interstate
Bancorp will also be subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s notice provisions
for stock repurchases.

     •    to finance the possible expansion of its business activities, including 
          developing new branch locations; and                                    
                                                                                  
     •    for general corporate purposes.                                         


     We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed

     Meridian Interstate Bancorp intends to invest the proceeds it retains from
the offering in short-term, liquid investments, such as U.S. treasury and
government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and cash and cash
equivalents, in order to supplement the interest income of East Boston Savings
Bank and increase consolidated interest income. The actual amounts to be
invested in different instruments will depend on the interest rate environment
and Meridian Interstate Bancorp’s liquidity requirements. In the future,
Meridian Interstate Bancorp may sell some or all of its investments and use the
proceeds of those sales:
                                                                                  
• to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory restrictions;

  assets; and

     Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks regulations restrict stock repurchases
by Meridian Interstate Bancorp within three years of the offering unless the
repurchase: (i) is part of a general repurchase made on a pro rata basis
pursuant to an offering approved by the Commissioner of the Banks and made to 
all stockholders of Meridian Interstate Bancorp (other than Meridian Financial 
Services with the approval of the Commissioner of Banks); (ii) is limited to the 
repurchase of qualifying shares of a director; (iii) is purchased in the open 
market by a tax-qualified or nontax-qualified employee stock benefit plan of 
Meridian Interstate Bancorp or East Boston Savings Bank in an amount
reasonable and appropriate to fund the plan; or (iv) is limited to stock
repurchases of no greater than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of Meridian
Interstate Bancorp where compelling and valid business reasons are established
to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Banks. In addition, pursuant to
Federal Reserve Board approval conditions imposed in connection with the
formation of Meridian Interstate Bancorp, Meridian Interstate Bancorp has
committed (i) to seek the Federal Reserve Board’s prior approval before
repurchasing any equity securities from Meridian Financial Services and (ii)
that any repurchases of equity securities from stockholders other than Meridian
Financial Services will be at the current market price. Meridian Interstate
Bancorp will also be subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s notice provisions
for stock repurchases.

     East Boston Savings Bank initially intends to invest the proceeds it
receives from the offering, which is shown in the table above as the amount

     •    to finance the possible expansion of its business activities, including 
          developing new branch locations; and                                    
                                                                                  
     •    for general corporate purposes.                                         


     We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses will be pre-funded with the proceeds of a
      $100,000 note from Lazard, as described below. This note, plus interest,    
      will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the 
      trust account upon the closing of this offering.                            

(2)   No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
      insider warrants or on the sale of the 5,000,000 units that Lazard may      
      purchase directly from the underwriter in this offering.                    

(3)   The underwriter has agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and     
      until we consummate an initial business combination and has waived its right
      to receive such payment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete an
      initial business combination.                                               

(4)   The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $125,000   
      even if the over-allotment option is exercised. In addition, up to          
      $6,000,000 of interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust       
      account will be available to us to pay for our working capital requirements.
      For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as   
      the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the  
      offering. In addition, amounts required to pay income taxes may be drawn    
      from the trust account prior to the initial business combination.           

(5)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these  
      items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may   
      incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in   
      connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based    
      upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not        
      anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than           
      fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
      fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
      category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital. We 
      do not expect to exceed $6,125,000 in funding our working capital           
      requirements.                                                               

(6)   Assumes our stockholders have not approved an extension of the time period  
      in which we may consummate a business combination from 24 to up to 36 months
      as described in this prospectus. If our stockholders approve such an        
      extension, we could incur up to $540,000 ($15,000 per month for up to 36    
      months) for the administrative fee payable to Lazard.                       

We estimate that approximately $799,650,000, or $917,838,000 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering,
including the $12,500,000 we will receive from the sale of the insider warrants,
will be placed in a trust account maintained by Mellon Bank, N.A., New York, New
York, as account agent. This amount of proceeds from this offering also includes
$31,800,000 (or $36,888,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to
the underwriter in this offering. The underwriter has agreed that such amount
will not be paid unless and until we consummate a business combination and has
waived its right to receive such payment upon our liquidation if we are unable
to complete a business combination. Our agreement with the account agent
requires the account agent, upon our written instruction, to invest and reinvest
the proceeds in the trust account in (a) a Mellon Bank, N.A. money market
deposit account or (b) one or more money market funds we select for which The
Dreyfus Corporation, an affiliate of the account agent, or any subsidiary or
affiliate thereof serves as investment advisor, administrator, shareholder
servicing agent, custodian or subcustodian and (c) upon our written request, the
account agent shall be required to (x) invest such requested amount directly in
United States treasury bonds, bills or notes identified by us and (y) sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of treasuries identified by us, provided, that the
amount of treasuries held at any time may not exceed $10 million. Such money
market funds must invest principally either in short-term securities issued or
guaranteed by the United States having a rating in the highest investment
category granted thereby by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
acquisition or in tax exempt municipal bonds issued by governmental entities
located within the United States. Except with respect to (1) interest income
that may be released to us of (i) up to $6,000,000 to fund expenses related to
investigating and selecting a target business or businesses and our other
working capital requirements and (ii) any additional amounts we may need to pay
our income or other tax obligations and (2) funds to be used to make payments to
stockholders who exercise their conversion right in connection with an extension
of our corporate existence that is effected, the proceeds will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business
combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be
used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business or businesses with
which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration
to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the
target business.

The payment to Lazard of a monthly fee of $15,000 is for certain services, as
well as the use of certain limited office space, including a conference room, in
New York City. We believe that the fees charged by Lazard for these services are
at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third
party. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination
or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. 
Reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lazard and its 
affiliates, as well as our officers, directors and any of their affiliates, in 
connection with activities on our behalf, such as searching for and identifying 
potential target businesses as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants
or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their 
operations or meet with their representatives or owners, will be paid by us out 
of the funds not held in trust and the $6,000,000 of interest earned on the 
trust account available to us and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and 
other third-party expenses attendant to the search for target businesses and to
the due diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation of a business 
combination,” and “Working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O 
insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation obligations and reserves.” 
Except as set forth under “The Offering—Limited payments to insiders,” our audit 
committee will review and approve reimbursements, payments and fees made in 
excess of $300,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal quarter to our stockholders, 
any member of our management team or Lazard and any such reimbursements, 
payments or fees made to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and 
approved by our board of directors, with the interested director or directors 
abstaining from such review and approval. Since the role of present management 
after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $125,000. In addition, interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $6,000,000, may be released
to us to fund our working capital requirements. We will also be entitled to have
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any
tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $1,125,000) in part for director and officer liability insurance
premiums (approximately $400,000), and if the balance of $5,000,000 being held
for due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lazard in connection
with activities on our behalf as described below. We believe these funds will be
sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use
a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for
financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
business or businesses or as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a
provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from
“shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable
to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business
combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we
entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business or businesses, the amount that would be used
as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on
the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available
funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our
breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue
searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target
businesses and, therefore, our liquidation.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business or
businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. Additionally, while we are
not obligated to engage the underwriter or Lazard to assist us with locating a
target business or businesses following this offering, we are not restricted
from doing so. If we did, we may pay a fee to them for their services for
assisting us in locating a target business or businesses. Any such engagement of
Lazard would require the approval of our audit committee, which is comprised of
independent directors. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or
in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in
the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will
be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new 
products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or
finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business 
combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust account were 
insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Lazard has agreed to advance us the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
approximately $100,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

On October 1, 2007, Lazard loaned us, in the form of a note, $100,000 for
payment of offering expenses on our behalf. The note bears interest at a rate of
3.60% per year and will be payable on the earlier of April 1, 2008 or the
closing of this offering. The note will be repaid out of the proceeds of this
offering not being placed in trust.

We believe that, following the closing of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months (or up to 36 months if extended
pursuant to a stockholder vote as described in this prospectus), assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if a public stockholder, other than Lazard or
our directors, converts such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination or an extension of our corporate existence which such public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate or effect. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Upon the consummation of the initial business combination, the underwriter will
be entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust account
comprised of the underwriter’s discounts and commissions held in the trust
account. If we do not complete an initial business combination and the account
agent must therefore distribute the balance in the trust account, the
underwriter has agreed (i) on our liquidation to forfeit any rights or claims to
the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions then in the trust account,
and (ii) that the account agent is authorized to distribute the deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions to the public stockholders on a pro rata
basis."

(1)   $257,500 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, FINRA
      filing fee and AMEX listing fee, have been paid from the $200,000 loan from 
      Medallion, as further described below, and the $57,500 paid by our founding 
      stockholders in our initial capitalization. These expenses will be repaid   
      out of the net proceeds of this offering not being deposited in the trust   
      account upon consummation of this offering.                                 

(2)   Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this    
      offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including      
      4.3125%, or $8,625,000 to be held in trust ($9,918,750 if the underwriter’s 
      over-allotment option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business
      combination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, such deferred 
      discount, net of amounts paid to stockholders who both vote against the     
      business combination and exercise their conversion rights, shall be released
      to the underwriters out of the gross proceeds of this offering held in a trust       
      account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as    
      trustee. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the 
      deferred discount.                                                            

(3)   Reduced by the $500,000 of offering expenses for which the underwriters have
      agreed to reimburse us.                                                     

(4)   The amount of proceeds not held in trust, excluding disbursements from the  
      trust account of interest income, net of related taxes, will remain constant
      at $175,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. We currently estimate  
      that we would require up to $50,000 should our corporate existence cease to 
      exist on January 17, 2010 to liquidate the company in the event we do not   
      consummate a business combination. We will be permitted to seek             
      disbursements from the trust account of interest income, net of taxes       
      payable on all interest income earned on the trust account, up to an        
      aggregate of $2,250,000 for working capital purposes.                       

Of the net proceeds of this offering, $185,375,000 (or $213,275,000 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $6,000,000 from the purchase of
founder warrants, for an aggregate of $191,375,000 (or $219,275,000 if the
over-allotment is exercised in full) will be placed in a trust account
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. Additionally, $8,625,000 (or $9,918,750 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount will be deposited into such trustee account for a total
amount in trust of $200,000,000 (or $229,193,750 if the over-allotment is
exercised in full). The proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or as part of any
liquidation of our trust account. To the extent the trust account earns interest
or we are deemed to have earned income in connection therewith, we will be
permitted to seek disbursements from the trust account to pay any federal, state
or local tax obligations related thereto or any franchise tax obligations. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target acquisition with which we complete a business combination
(excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the
underwriters’ discount). Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business will be used to finance our operations, which may include
the target business(es) we acquired on the consummation of the business
combination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined
by our board of directors at that time. All amounts held in the trust account
that are not converted to cash or released to us as interest income, net of
income taxes, will be released on closing of our initial business combination
with a target acquisition having a fair market value of at least 80% of our net
assets (excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of
the underwriter’s discount) at the time of such business combination, subject to
a majority of our public stockholders voting in favor of the business
combination and less than 30% of the public stockholders voting against the
business combination and electing their conversion rights. Our threshold for
conversion rights has been established at 30% although historically blank check
companies have used a 20% threshold. We have set the threshold at 30% in order
to reduce the likelihood that a small group of investors holding a block of our
outstanding shares of common stock will be able to stop us from completing a
business combination that is otherwise approved by a large majority of our
public stockholders. This structural change is consistent with many other blank
check companies that have recently filed registration statements with the SEC
and it will increase the likelihood of an approval of any proposed business
combination by making it easier for us to consummate a business combination with
which public stockholders may not agree. However, the 30% threshold entails
certain risks, such as, if our business combination requires us to use
substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not
know how many stockholders may exercise such conversion rights, we may either
need to reserve a larger part of the trust account for possible payment upon
such conversion, or we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund
our business combination in case a larger percentage of stockholders exercise
their conversion rights than we expect. These risks are more fully described
under the headings, “Risk Factors—Although historically blank check companies
have used a 20% threshold for conversion rights, we allow up to approximately
29.99% of our public stockholders to exercise their conversion rights. This

with which you may not agree, and you may not receive the full amount of your
original investment upon exercise of your conversion rights” and “—The ability

We have agreed to pay Medallion a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and
administrative services, including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. The office space will consist of an undivided portion of Medallion’s
existing offices, the utilities will be those attributable to our use of that
space and the secretarial and administrative support will be provided by
existing Medallion personnel who are located at Medallion’s existing office
space. The terms of this arrangement were negotiated by Medallion and us and are
not intended to be compensation paid to Medallion. We believe that, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the area surrounding our offices in New
York City, the fee charged by Medallion is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated third party. We believe that this office
space and these services will be adequate for our needs.

We intend to use the $175,000 of net proceeds not held in trust and up to
$2,250,000 of net interest income earned on the trust account for due diligence,
legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition including investment
banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring and negotiating business
combination, as well as a possible down payment, reverse break up fees (a
provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to the target company
if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up or “no-shop”
provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target acquisitions
from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more
favorable to such target acquisitions), if necessary, to bear the costs of
liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a business combination by
January 17, 2010. While we do not have any current intention to use these funds
as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent
where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition,
the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision
would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and
the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, potential target acquisitions. In addition to the use of funds
described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to
consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition. We believe
that the interest income will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses.

To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or in
part as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event that
indebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as consideration
to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which
are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third party
indebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors would not be
personally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is
less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event, the
proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance our operations, which may include the target
business(es) that we acquire on the business combination, to effect other
acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board of directors at
that time. We may use these funds, among other things, for director and officer
compensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to finance
the operations of the target acquisition, to make other acquisitions and to
pursue our growth strategy.

In the event that third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering, Medallion would be personally liable for the
repayment of such indebtedness. Medallion has advanced to us a total of
approximately $352,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fees, FINRA
registration fees, AMEX application and listing fees, blue sky filing fees and
legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on
the earlier of September 4, 2008, or the consummation of this offering. The loan
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not held in trust.

The proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in United
States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. Although the rate of interest to be earned on
the trust account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust account, and
although we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will take to
complete a business combination, we anticipate the interest that will accrue on
the trust account, even at an interest rate of 4% (up to $2,250,000 interest
income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the trust
account), during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an
acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. While
we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this rate, we believe such
rate is representative of that which we may receive. By restricting the
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed
an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the
requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distribute the trust account
to holders of our common stock sold in this offering until after our existence
terminates by operation of law on January 17, 2010 and, consequently, we may be
deemed to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such act.
The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this
period that is not otherwise returned to public stockholders who vote against a
business combination will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed. We do not believe that the fees and expenses for due
diligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, down payment, lock-up or other
activities related to this offering or our business combination will exceed
$2,425,000 in the aggregate, comprised of $175,000 of net proceeds not held in
trust plus up to $2,250,000 of net interest income. Based upon the experience of
the members of our board and consultation with them regarding a reasonable
budget for consummating a transaction of this kind and nature, and a review of
budgets publicly disclosed by blank-check companies, we determined that this was
an appropriate approximation of the expenses. If costs are higher than expected
we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due
diligence with respect to, any potential target acquisitions. In such case, we
would need to obtain additional funds from our founding stockholders or another
source to continue operations. We believe that, upon consummation of this
offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the
next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during
that time.

We will pay Medallion a fee of $7,500 per month for office space and
administrative services. Our Chief Executive Officer, Tony Tavares, is the
President and Chief Executive Officer of ProEminent Sports, LLC. Pursuant to a
consulting agreement between ProEminent Sports, LLC and Medallion Financial
Corp., Mr. Tavares acts as a consultant to Medallion Financial Corp. for sports
related investments and, included within the scope of his duties is his service
to us. Pursuant to the consulting agreement, Mr. Tavares has, among other
things, agreed to serve as our Chief Executive Officer, review and comment on
this prospectus and help define our scope of business. Following consummation of
this offering, Mr. Tavares has agreed to help us identify a target business in
the sports, entertainment and leisure industries, perform due diligence on the
proposed target and negotiate and consummate a business combination with such a
target business. Following a business combination, in the event Mr. Tavares is
not offered employment with us as our Chief Executive Officer or a board
position with us, Medallion has agreed to continue Mr. Tavares’ consulting
arrangement for at least an additional twelve months. For the services rendered
by ProEminent Sports, LLC to Medallion, Medallion pays ProEminent Sports a
monthly fee of $20,000. Our advisors, Robert Caporale and Randel Vataha, are
Chairman and President, respectively, and each own 50% of the membership
interests, of Game Plan LLC. Medallion Financial Corp. is party to an agreement
with Game Plan LLC pursuant to which Game Plan LLC will provide certain
consulting services to Medallion and to us, including advising us in identifying
a target business in the sports, entertainment and leisure industries. Following
consummation of this offering, Mr. Caporale and Mr. Vataha have agreed to help
us identify a target business in the sports, entertainment and leisure
industries, perform due diligence on the proposed target and negotiate and
consummate a business combination with such a target business. For the services
rendered by Game Plan to Medallion, Medallion pays Game Plan a monthly fee of
$10,000. The fees paid by Medallion pursuant to the consulting agreements are
solely borne by Medallion and will not be reimbursed by us from the proceeds of 
this offering. We may separately engage Game Plan LLC in the future to provide 
consulting services to us in connection with identifying a target business in 
the sports, entertainment and leisure industries and consummating a business 
combination with such a target business. The services to be rendered and the fees 
to be paid to Game Plan under any future engagement will be the subject of 
negotiation between the parties prior to such engagement and approved by a majority
of our directors who are disinterested in such engagement. Our Vice Chairman and 
Secretary, Andrew M. Murstein, also serves as the President and member of the 
Board of Directors of Medallion Financial Corp. Our Chief Financial Officer, 
Larry D. Hall, also serves as the Chief Financial Officer of Medallion Financial 
Corp. Other than the fees under these agreements and under any future agreement 
with Game Plan LLC into which we may enter and the compensation paid by Medallion 
Financial Corp. to these officers and advisors, no compensation of any kind 
(including finders, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our
existing officers, directors or stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior 
to, or for any services that they render in order to effectuate, or in connection 
with the consummation of the business combination. However, such persons will 
receive reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target acquisitions, performing business due diligence on
suitable target acquisitions and business combinations, as well as traveling to
and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target
acquisitions to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will
be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated in the
above table to “Legal, accounting and other expenses,” “Due diligence of
prospective target acquisitions” and “Working capital.” Additionally, there is
no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses that could be incurred and
there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other
than our board of directors, which would include persons who may seek
reimbursement, or a court of competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is
challenged. Since the role of present management after a business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder (but not our founding stockholders with respect to any
shares of our common stock owned by each of them immediately before this
offering) will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including
interest earned on such stockholder’s portion of the trust account, net of taxes
payable and amounts disbursed for working capital purposes) only in the event of
our liquidation of the trust account as part of our liquidation upon our failure
to complete a business combination, or if such public stockholder converts his
shares of common stock into cash in connection with a business combination that
the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account. Our founding stockholders, directors and
officers are not entitled to convert any of their shares of common stock
acquired prior to this offering, in this offering or after this offering into a
pro rata share of the trust account.

Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount held in trust excluding any accrued interest thereon, net
of amounts paid to stockholders who both vote against the business combination
and exercise their conversion rights. In the event that we are unable to
consummate a business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the
trust account, the underwriters have agreed that: (i) they will forfeit any
rights or claims to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon; and (ii) the
proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ discount will be distributed on a
pro-rata basis among the public stockholders along with any accrued interest
thereon."

of 16,250,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting
structuring fees to be paid to Lehman Brothers Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. and estimated underwriting discounts of $20.7 million, but before paying
estimated offering expenses and related formation transaction expenses. We base
this amount on the initial public offering price of $20.00 per common unit.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to:
 
•  pay $300.9 million to purchase a 15.9% general partnership interest in     
   Northwest; and

   formation transactions.                                                    
 
Following the closing, Northwest will distribute $300.9 million to a subsidiary
of Williams as a reimbursement for capital expenditures incurred with respect to
Northwest’s assets.
 
If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units is exercised in
full, we will use the net proceeds of approximately $45.6 million from the sale
of these additional common units to redeem from our general partner the number
of common units equal to the number of common units issued upon exercise of the
underwriters’ option."

      to fund our working capital.                                  

  (2) Represents $3,000,000 (or $3,450,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment    
      option is exercised in full) of the underwriters’ discount, which the       
      underwriters have agreed to deposit into the trust account and forfeit if we
      do not consummate a business combination.                                   

  (3) As indicated, the above table is an estimate of the use of the net proceeds 
      of the offering and the sale of the insider warrants. The “Miscellaneous”   
      line item is intended to cover any accounting, legal, printing or other     
      ancillary costs associated with the offering and the sale of the insider    
      warrants which are more costly than estimated.                              

  (4) We expect the estimated amount of the net interest earned on the trust      
      account that may be released to us to cover our operating expenses will be  
      approximately $2,000,000.                                                   

  (5) In the event the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,  
      to the extent the funds in trust are less than $10.00 per share, the first  
      $750,000 in interest earned on the amount held in the trust account (net of 
      taxes payable) will be used to cover such shortfall to bring the amount held
      in trust for the benefit of the public shareholders to an aggregate of      
      $115,000,000 ($10.00 per share).                                            

A total of $100,000,000 ($114,300,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full), of the proceeds of the offering and the proceeds from the
sale of the insider warrants will be placed in a trust account at J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as
trustee. In the event the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in
full, to the extent the funds in trust are less than $10.00 per share, the first
$750,000 in interest earned on the amount held in the trust account (net of
taxes payable) will be used to cover such shortfall to bring the amount held in
trust for the benefit of the public shareholders to an aggregate of $115,000,000
($10.00 per share). Of the amount held in the trust account, up to $3,000,000
($3,450,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
will be paid to the underwriters as deferred fees in connection with this
offering, if and only if a business combination is consummated, leaving us with
$97,000,000 with which to consummate a business combination. Other than interest
income which may be released to us as described in the table above, the proceeds
held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of a business combination or our dissolution and liquidation to
our public shareholders of our trust account in the event of our automatic
dissolution and liquidation, net of any taxes paid or payable. The proceeds held
in the trust account (exclusive of any funds held for the benefit of the
underwriters or used to pay public shareholders who have exercised their
redemption rights in accordance with the instructions set forth in the proxy
materials to be mailed to our shareholders.) may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business 
combination or, if funds not held in trust are insufficient, to pay other 
expenses relating to such transaction such as reimbursement to insiders for 
out-of-pocket expenses, third party due diligence expenses or potential finders 
fees, in each case only upon the consummation of a business combination. Any 
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business, to effect other acquisitions,
or for any other corporate use as our board of directors may determine at such 
time, including, but not limited to, continuing or expanding the target 
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the 
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of 
the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.

We have reserved $7,500 per month for general and administrative services,
including but not limited to receptionist, secretarial and general office
services. This amount will be paid to, and such services will be provided by, an
unaffiliated third party.

We have estimated the costs to identify and research prospective target
businesses and the costs related to the business combination, including legal
and accounting expenses to structure the transaction, prepare the transaction
documents and file the related proxy statement, will be approximately
$1,550,000. We intend to fund such costs from up to $2,000,000 of the interest
earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account, less interest earned on
the trust account held back in the trust account to ensure a $10.00 per share
liquidation price to public shareholders (if applicable). Although the rate of
interest to be earned on the trust account will fluctuate through the duration
of the trust account, and although we are unable to state the exact amount of
time it will take to complete a business combination, we anticipate the interest
that will accrue on the trust account, even at an interest rate of 5% per annum
(which would generate approximately $10,000,000 of interest on the trust account
during the 24-month period following the completion of the offering, or
$11,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is fully exercised) will
be sufficient to identify a target, complete an acquisition and to fund our
working capital requirements. While we cannot assure you the trust account will
yield this rate, we believe such rate is representative of that which we may
receive.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of our officers and directors, and may include engaging market
research firms and/or third party consultants, including legal and accounting
professionals. Our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for
any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with
such due diligence activities.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds and a portion of the interest
earned on the funds in the trust account which is released to us allocated to
working capital and for director and officer liability insurance premiums. We
intend to fund our working capital needs as well as amounts that may exceed our
current estimates, from the interest earned on the proceeds being held in the
trust account (less any interest amounts held in trust to cover any shortfalls
if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), with the balance being held
for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described below. Up to $2,000,000 of interest earned on the trust account in
excess of the amount necessary to have a $10.00 per share liquidation price to
the public shareholders will be released to us to fund our working capital
requirements pending consummation of a business combination. Interest will be
payable to public shareholders redeeming in connection with a business
combination, pro rata, net of amounts previously released to us and taxes
payable.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of such working capital to make
a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit
such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such
payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital
available outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other
expenses related to finding another suitable business combination without
securing additional financing. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the
allotted time and would be forced to dissolve and liquidate under our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is
less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event, the
proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be released to us and used to finance the operations of the target
businesses, which may include subsequent acquisitions.

As of the date of this prospectus, Ho Capital Management LLC, our Sponsor, has
agreed to make available to us a line of credit of up to $500,000, which will be
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering, such as SEC registration
fees, FINRA registration fees, and certain legal and accounting fees and
expenses. These loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of January
31, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of
the net proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account and not
from the $2,000,000 to be released to us from interest earned in the trust
account to fund our working capital.

In seeking a business combination, we intend to utilize cash derived from the
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the insider warrants, as well as our
capital stock or debt, or a combination of cash, capital stock and debt, and
there is no limit on the issuance of capital stock or incurrence of debt we may
undertake in effecting a business combination. In the event a business
combination is consummated, all sums remaining in the trust account will be
released to us immediately thereafter, and there will be no restriction on our
use of such funds.

The net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the insider warrants not held
in the trust account and not immediately required for the purposes set forth
above will be invested only in United States “government securities,” defined as
any Treasury Bill issued by the United States having a maturity of one hundred
and eighty days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. By
restricting the investment of the proceeds of this offering, and the sale of the
insider warrants to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the
requirements of such act, we may be considered to be an investment company and
thus required to comply with such act. As disclosed in the table above, the
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, and all costs associated with the consummation of
a business combination, until a business combination is completed. We believe
that, upon consummation of this offering and the sale of the insider warrants,
interest income generated by the funds held in trust, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be
paid by us or any person or entity to any of our existing shareholders, or any
of their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with
the consummation of the business combination. However, our existing
shareholders, officers and directors will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. After the consummation of a
business combination, if any, to the extent our management remains as officers
of the resulting business, we anticipate that they may enter into employment or
consulting agreements, the terms of which shall be negotiated and which we
expect to be comparable to employment or consulting agreements with other
similarly-situated companies in the industry in which we consummate a business
combination. Further, after the consummation of a business combination, if any,
to the extent our directors remain as directors of the resulting business, we
anticipate that they will receive compensation comparable to directors at other
similarly-situated companies in the industry in which we consummate a business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, if
any, less the amount of taxes paid or payable, if any, on interest earned but
previously released to us) only in the event of our automatic dissolution and
the liquidation of our trust account to our public shareholders upon our failure
to complete a business combination. If that public shareholder were to seek to
redeem such shares for cash in connection with a business combination which the
public shareholder voted against and which we actually consummate, such public
shareholder would be entitled to receive $10.00 per share. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account plus interest, net of taxes payable and interest
released to us. The term public shareholders means the holders of ordinary
shares sold as part of the units in this offering or acquired in the open
market, but excludes all of our officers and directors with respect to the
shares owned by them prior to this offering and the shares included in the
insider warrants to be purchased by our Sponsor immediately prior to the date of
this prospectus, since they have waived their redemption rights to any
liquidation amounts with respect to these shares upon our dissolution."

  (1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
      FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange 
      filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been or will be  
      paid from the funds we received from Trivergance, LLC described below. These
      funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.  

  (2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
      insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts  
      are reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of
      the offering. An additional $6,750,000, or $7,762,500 if the over-allotment 
      option is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in trust        
      following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the underwriters  
      only if and when we consummate a business combination.                      

  (3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $100,000   
      even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, $1,800,000 of interest
      income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to 
      us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of             
      presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount  
      of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.         

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our initial
stockholders have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate
purchase price of $4,500,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.
We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the
insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be
placed in the trust fund described below.

$145,500,000, or $167,437,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering before payment of deferred underwriting fees,
plus the $4,500,000 we will receive from the sale of the insider warrants, will
be placed in a trust account at Smith Barney, a division of Citigroup Global
Markets, Inc., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting
discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The
underwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we
consummate a business combination and have waived their right to receive such
payment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business
combination. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest income
that may be released to us of (i) up to $1,800,000 to fund expenses related to
investigating and selecting a target business and our other working capital
requirements and (ii) any additional amounts we may need to pay our income or
other tax obligations, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Trivergance, LLC, an affiliate of each of Marc V. Byron, Lowell
D. Kraff, David Palmer and Jerry Stone, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Trivergance, LLC for
our benefit and is not intended to provide Messrs. Byron, Kraff, Palmer and
Stone compensation in lieu of a salary. Our management believes, based on our
review of rents and fees for similar services in the New Jersey metropolitan
area, that the fee charged by Trivergance is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of a business combination or the distribution of the trust account to
our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to
“Legal, accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the due diligence
investigation, structuring and negotiation of a business combination,” “Due
diligence of prospective target businesses by our officers, directors or
existing stockholders” and “Working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O
insurance, general corporate purposes and reserves.” Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $100,000. In addition, interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $1,800,000, may be released
to us to fund our working capital requirements. These funds will be used by us
for director and officer liability insurance premiums, due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our
behalf as described above. We will also be entitled to have interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any tax obligations
that we may owe. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could also use a portion of these
funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
business or to use as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a
provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from
“shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable
to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business
combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we
entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right of exclusivity from
a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a
“no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific
business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our
forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could
result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or
conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders’ fees that we had incurred prior to the
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of
the trust fund were insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate our initial business combination, we
will pay the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust
account. If such funds are insufficient, our initial stockholders have agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to
seek repayment of such expenses.

Trivergance, LLC has advanced to us a total of $100,000 which was used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for
SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the
American Stock Exchange listing fee, and a portion of the legal and audit fees
and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the earlier of July
12, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of
the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

  (1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
      FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange 
      filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been or will be  
      paid from the funds we received from Trivergance, LLC described below. These
      funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.  

  (2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
      insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts  
      are reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of
      the offering. An additional $6,750,000, or $7,762,500 if the over-allotment 
      option is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in trust        
      following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the underwriters  
      only if and when we consummate a business combination.                      

  (3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $100,000   
      even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, $1,800,000 of interest
      income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to 
      us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of             
      presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount  
      of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.         

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our initial
stockholders have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate
purchase price of $4,500,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.
We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the
insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be
placed in the trust fund described below.

$145,500,000, or $167,437,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering before payment of deferred underwriting fees,
plus the $4,500,000 we will receive from the sale of the insider warrants, will
be placed in a trust account at Smith Barney, a division of Citigroup Global
Markets, Inc., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting
discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The
underwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we
consummate a business combination and have waived their right to receive such
payment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business
combination. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest income
that may be released to us of (i) up to $1,800,000 to fund expenses related to
investigating and selecting a target business and our other working capital
requirements and (ii) any additional amounts we may need to pay our income or
other tax obligations, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Trivergance, LLC, an affiliate of each of Marc V. Byron, Lowell
D. Kraff, David Palmer and Jerry Stone, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Trivergance, LLC for
our benefit and is not intended to provide Messrs. Byron, Kraff, Palmer and
Stone compensation in lieu of a salary. Our management believes, based on our
review of rents and fees for similar services in the New Jersey metropolitan
area, that the fee charged by Trivergance is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of a business combination or the distribution of the trust account to
our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as

    The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the offering
may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase
if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not
purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering. Payments for
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result
in the receipt of new funds for investment but will result in a reduction of
Danversbank's deposits. In all instances, Danversbank will receive at least 50%
of the net proceeds of the offering.

    We are undertaking the offering at this time to increase our capital to
expand and diversify our business. The offering proceeds will increase our 
capital resources and the amount of funds available for lending and investment 
purposes. The proceeds will also give us greater flexibility to diversify 
operations and expand the products and services we offer to our customers.

    Danvers Bancorp may use the proceeds it retains from the conversion:

        º to deposit funds in Danversbank;

        º to invest in securities;

        º to finance the purchase of common stock in the offering by
          Danversbank's employee stock ownership plan;

        º to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches and
          other financial services businesses as opportunities arise;

        º to pay down the trust preferred securities of Danvers Capital Trust II
          in February 2009;

        º to pay the debt service on Danvers Bancorp's trust preferred
          securities;

        º to pay dividends to its stockholders;

        º to repurchase shares of its common stock; and

        º for general corporate purposes.

    During the first year following the conversion, we may be prohibited from
repurchasing shares of our common stock, except to fund benefit plans. The loan
that will be used to fund the purchases by the employee stock ownership plan
will accrue interest.

    Danversbank may use the proceeds it receives from the conversion:

        º to expand its retail banking franchise by establishing de novo
          branches in Massachusetts;

        º to fund new loans;

        º to expand its sources of non-interest income by acquiring other
          financial services businesses, as opportunities arise;

        º to make necessary capital investments in facilities and technology;

        º to repay borrowings;

        º to invest in securities; and

        º for general corporate purposes.

    The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on changes in
interest rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial
services industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall
market conditions."

      connection with our business combination. If a business combination is 
      not consummated and we are liquidated, such amounts will be disbursed 
      among our public shareholders.                                     

  (4) The amount available to us for expenses and working capital will be the same
      regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised.               

  (5) These amounts are expected to be paid to legal, accounting and other outside
      professional firms to assist in negotiating, structuring and documenting a  
      business combination and the preparation and filing of the related proxy    
      statement.                                                                  

$34,030,000 or $39,241,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, of
net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,430,000 we will receive from the sale
of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at HSBC Bank USA,
National Association, maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting
discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The
underwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we
consummate a business combination and have waived their right to receive such
payment upon our automatic dissolution and voluntary liquidation if we are
unable to complete a business combination. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180
days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with
respect to $1,050,000 of interest income that may be released to us from time to
time, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our voluntary
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination.

The payment to Live ABC Interactive Co., Ltd. Beijing, an affiliate of James
Sha, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative services
including office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is
being agreed to by Live ABC Interactive Co., Ltd. Beijing for our benefit and is
not intended to provide our officers and directors compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the Beijing
area, that the fee charged by Live ABC Interactive Co., Ltd. Beijing is at least
as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public shareholders. Other than the
$7,500 per month administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, shareholders, special advisors or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the
consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to
“Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the due diligence
investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business combination,” “Due
diligence of prospective target businesses” and “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, taxes and reserves.” Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will initially be approximately $150,000. We intend to use
the excess working capital (approximately $1,050,000) for director and officer
liability insurance premiums, tax payments and in the event due diligence,
taxes, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our founding shareholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described above. In addition to the foregoing,
interest earned on the funds in the trust account of up to $1,050,000 may be
released to us from trust to fund our working capital requirements. We believe
that the total working capital available to us will be sufficient to cover our
expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the funds available
to us to pay to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business.
We could also use a portion of the funds available to us as a down payment or to 
fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep 
target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies 
on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular 
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to 
do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to 
receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a 
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the 
terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds
at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching 
for, conducting due diligence with respect to, or completing a business 
combination with, a potential target business.

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, we will not pay fees of any kind (including finder’s and
consulting fees) to any of our officers and directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our officers and directors
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There
are no limitations on the amount of expenses for which they can seek
reimbursement, provided such expenses were incurred for our benefit. Our board
of directors will have the responsibility of reviewing and approving all expense
reimbursements made to our directors, with the interested director or directors
abstaining from such review and approval. To the extent that such expenses
exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest
income that is released to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination. These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination
business and would be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable
of the combined business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such
combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States “government
securities” so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

The allocation of net proceeds not held in trust represents our best estimate of
the intended uses of these funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be
inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described
categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. While we are not obligated to engage any
of the underwriters, including EarlyBirdCapital, to assist us with locating a
target business following this offering, we are not restricted from doing so. If
we did, we may pay a fee to them for their services for assisting us in locating
a target business. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in
part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the
trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or
finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business
combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust fund were
insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of automatic dissolution and voluntary liquidation from our remaining
assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, James Sha 
and Diana Liu have agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such 
liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and
have agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.

James Sha, Diana Liu, and William Yu, each a director of ours, have advanced to
us a total of $100,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above related to the SEC registration fee,
FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The
loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of June 30, 2008 or the
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering available to us.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts we can receive from the trust account)
to operate for the next 30 months, assuming the period in which we need to
consummate a business combination has been extended, as provided in our
memorandum and articles of association and that a business combination is not
consummated during that time.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our automatic dissolution, voluntary liquidation or if that
public shareholder converts such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public shareholder voted against and which we consummate.
In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from advances we received  
    from our sponsors described below. These advances will be repaid out of the  
    proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account upon         
    consummation of this offering.                                               

(2) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
    these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.                  
                                      
(3) The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in the trust account  
    will remain constant at $100,000 even if the underwriters’ over-allotment is 
    exercised. In addition, $4,000,000, subject to adjustment, of interest income
    earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us to   
    pay for our working capital requirements. If the underwriters elect to       
    exercise the over-allotment option, it will result in a proportionate        
    increase in the amount of interest we may withdraw from the trust account.   
    For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the
    total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the       
    offering.                                                                    

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these   
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may    
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in    
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not   
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     

A total of approximately $348,650,000 (or approximately $399,785,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the sponsors’ warrants described in this
prospectus, including $15,400,000 (or $17,710,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions will be placed in the trust account maintained by Mellon Bank,
N.A., as account agent. Except for a portion of the interest income that may be
released to us, or used to pay taxes, the proceeds held in trust will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our
initial business combination or our liquidation. All amounts held in the trust
account that are not paid to public stockholders who elect to exercise their
conversion rights, released to us as interest income or used to pay taxes, will
be released promptly after closing of our initial business combination with one
or more target businesses which collectively have a fair market value of at
least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting
discounts and commissions of $15,400,000 (or $17,710,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the time of the signing of a
definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We
will proceed with our initial business combination only if (i) a majority of the
shares of common stock voted by the public stockholders are voted in favor of
the business combination, (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock are voted in favor of an amendment to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to provide for our perpetual existence and
(iii) public stockholders owning less than 35% of our shares of common stock
sold in this offering, on a cumulative basis, including the shares as to which
conversion rights were exercised in connection with the stockholder vote, if
any, required to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation to provide for an extension of the time period within which we
must complete our initial business combination and the stockholder vote required
to approve our initial business combination both vote against the business
combination and/or extended period, as applicable, and exercise their conversion
rights. In the event we structure our initial business combination to acquire
less than 100% of the equity interests of the target business, we will only
consummate such initial business combination if we become the controlling
stockholder of the target. The key factor that we will rely on in determining
controlling stockholder status will be our acquisition of at least 50.1% of the
voting equity interests of the target company. We will not consider any such
equity transaction that does not meet such criteria. Upon release of funds from
the trust account and after payment of the conversion price to any public
stockholders who exercise their conversion rights, the underwriters will receive
their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, and the remaining funds
will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase
price of the business or businesses with which our initial combination occurs.
If the business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, we may
apply the cash released to us from the trust account to general corporate
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired
business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness
incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase
of other companies, or for working capital.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of the members of our management team and may include engaging
market research firms and/or third party consultants. Members of our management
team, or their affiliates or associates, will not receive, earn or be paid or
awarded any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities. Our
audit committee will review and approve all individual reimbursements above
$10,000 made to any member of our management team, or their affiliates or
associates, and any expense reimbursements payable to members of our audit
committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the
interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account as well as (i) the
interest income earned on the trust account balance released to us to pay any
tax obligations and (ii) interest income of up to $4.0 million, subject to
adjustment, earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us (so
long as we have sufficient funds available to us to pay our tax obligations on
such interest income) will, in the aggregate, be sufficient to pay the costs and
expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact
that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken only after we have negotiated and
signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the
terms of our initial business combination. Although we do not know the rate of
interest to be earned on the trust account and are unable to predict an exact
amount of time it will take to complete any initial business combination, we
anticipate that the interest that will accrue on the trust account during the
time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be
sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. Given the limited amount of
time it will take to generate $4.0 million, subject to adjustment, of interest
on the trust account, we anticipate receiving such interest income generally
shortly after we incur working capital expenses. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or if interest
payments are not available to fund expenses at the time we incur them, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently not ascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us. To the extent that our expenses exceed the
amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income of up to
$4.0 million, subject to adjustment, that may be released to us from the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate an initial business combination. Our officers and directors may, as
part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of the
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed by us
prior to the closing of our initial business combination. If the owners of the
target business do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our officers
and directors to view such potential initial business combination unfavorably
and result in a potential conflict of interest.

If we complete our initial business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by members of our management team prior to the business combination’s
closing will become an obligation of the post-combination business, assuming
these out-of-pocket expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing.
These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would
be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined
business. Members of our management team may, as part of any such combination,
negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the target
business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our management
team to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in a
conflict of interest.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect our initial business combination, the proceeds held in
the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to
finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could
be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of
the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsors have advanced to us an aggregate
of $250,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA
registration fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange fee
and accounting and legal fees and expenses. These advances are non-interest
bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of October 31, 2008 or the 
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in the trust account.

The net proceeds of this offering held in the trust account and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in U.S.
‘‘government securities,’’ defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 that only invest in such ‘‘government securities’’ having a maturity of
180 days or less, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. Interest income earned on the trust account
balance released to us to pay any tax obligations and, in addition, interest
income of up to $4.0 million, subject to adjustment, earned on the trust account
balance may be released to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our
working capital requirements (so long as we have sufficient funds available to
us to pay our tax obligations on such interest income).

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be
paid or awarded by us or a target business to, or earned by, members of our
management team or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to
or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination.
However, members of our management team will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that such expenses
exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest
income of up to $4.0 million, subject to adjustment, that is released to us from
the trust account (so long as we have sufficient funds available to us to pay
our tax obligations on such interest income or otherwise then due at that time),
such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us prior to our
consummation of our initial business combination. In the event our initial
business combination is consummated by us and irrespective of whether such
persons remain associated with us, our audit committee and/or our board of
directors may determine to reimburse such persons for such expenses. There is no
limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us to such persons. A
public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only
in the event of our liquidation if we fail to complete our initial business
combination within the allotted time or if the public stockholder seeks to
convert such shares into cash in connection with our initial business
combination that the public stockholder voted against and that we actually
complete. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or
interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust account.

On completion of our initial business combination, the underwriters will receive
the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust account,
reduced pro rata by the exercise of any conversion rights described in this
prospectus. If we do not complete an initial business combination and the
account agent must therefore distribute the balance in the trust account, the
underwriters have agreed (i) on our liquidation to forfeit any rights or claims
to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued
interest thereon, then in the trust account, and (ii) that the account agent is
authorized to distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions,
together with any accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such
interest, to the public stockholders on a pro rata basis."

   •  we estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common     
      stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and          
      commissions and estimated offering costs of approximately $4.3 million      
      payable by us, will be approximately $1.5 million (or $2.3 million if the   
      underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full);                 
  
   •  we expect to generate approximately $4.6 million of cash proceeds from this 
      offering (or $5.4 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
      in full), which is approximately $3.1 million greater than the estimated net
      proceeds of this offering due to our prior payment of $3.1 million of       
      various offering expenses.                                                  

    We intend to use the cash proceeds of this offering to fund the growth of
our business, including:

   •  approximately $3.1 million to commence full scale enrollment in the MARVEL  
      Trial;                                                                      
  
   •  approximately $900,000 for the repayment of a portion of principal and      
      accrued interest on the BlueCrest Loan; and                                 
  
   •  approximately $150,000 for projected payments pursuant to our license       
      agreements.                                                                 

    We intend to use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
    The $3.1 million listed above, when aggregated with approximately
$3.5 million of cash currently held, is expected to be sufficient to fund
enrollment, randomization and treatment of approximately 130 of the 330 patients
in the MARVEL Trial. We believe we will need to raise, in addition to the cash
proceeds of this offering, at least $9.7 million to finance the completion of
the MARVEL Trial.

    The enumerated uses of the proceeds of this offering described above include
all the offering proceeds we expect to utilize to make payments under our
existing license agreements, collaborative agreements, partnerships and joint
ventures. We do not have any agreements or understandings relating to the
acquisition of technologies or businesses or the establishment of new
partnerships or joint ventures with respect to which we anticipate using the
proceeds of this offering.

    The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
from our expectations depending upon numerous factors, including our results of
operation, financial condition and capital requirements. Accordingly, we will
retain the discretion to allocate the cash proceeds of this offering among the
identified uses described above, and we reserve the right to change the
allocation of the net proceeds among the uses described above. Pending their
use, we intend to invest the cash proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities.

    The proceeds of the $5 million BlueCrest Loan, which bears interest at the
rate of 12.85% and which is scheduled to mature in May 2010, are anticipated to
be used for general corporate purposes. The BlueCrest Loan is secured by a first
priority security interest in all of our assets, excluding our intellectual
property but including the proceeds from any sale of our intellectual property."

1) Assumes that 1,247,500 units will be sold through the directed unit program  
    described in this prospectus. No underwriting discounts or commissions will  
    be paid on such units. The amount of underwriting discount held in the trust 
    account, approximately 4.2% of offering gross proceeds or approximately      
    $16.4 million (or approximately $18.9 million if the over-allotment option is
    exercised in full), less pro-rata reductions resulting from the exercise of  
    stockholder conversion rights as described in this prospectus, will be paid  
    to the underwriters upon consummation of the initial business combination and
    will not be available to us. In the event that we do not consummate our      
    initial business combination within the required time period, the            
    underwriters will forfeit any right to that amount, which will be included in
    the liquidation distribution to our public stockholders.                     

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from an advance we received
    from Greenhill as described below. This advance (and any accrued interest    
    thereon) will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed
    in the trust account upon consummation of this offering.                     

(3) The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in the trust account  
    will remain constant at $225,000 even if the underwriters’ over-allotment    
    option is exercised.                                                         

(4) $5.0 million of interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust      
    account will be available to us to pay any additional offering expenses and  
    to pay for our working capital requirements. If the underwriters determine   
    that the size of this offering should be increased or the underwriters elect 
    to exercise the over-allotment option, the amount of interest income earned  
    on the trust account that can be released to us to fund our working capital  
    will be increased proportionately. For purposes of presentation, the full    
    amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available
    to us immediately following the offering.                                    

A total of approximately $400,000,000 (or approximately $458,931,682 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including
$383,648,500 of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants (or $440,048,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full) and approximately $16.4 million (or approximately
$18.9 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions will be placed in a trust
account at Wachovia Securities, LLC, with American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company as trustee. Except for a portion of the interest income to be released
to us, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation. If we consummate an initial business combination, all amounts held
in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions
of approximately $16.4 million (or approximately $18.9 million if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full), less pro-rata reductions resulting
from the exercise of stockholder conversion rights as described below, which
will be paid to the underwriters) that are not (i) paid to public stockholders
exercising their conversion rights or (ii) previously released to us as
described below to pay income taxes or as working capital, will be released to
us upon the closing of our initial business combination, which must involve one
or more target businesses with a fair market value of at least 80% of the
balance in the trust account at the time of such business combination. The funds
released to us may be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of our
initial business combination. We may apply any funds released to us from the
trust account not used to pay the purchase price – for example, because we paid
all or a portion of the purchase price for our initial business combination
using stock or debt securities – for general corporate purposes, including for
maintenance or expansion of operations of an acquired business or businesses,
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in
consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other
companies, or for working capital.

We have allocated $225,000 of the offering proceeds to pay any additional
offering expenses and to fund a portion of our working capital. We intend to
fund the majority of our working capital requirements from a portion of the
interest earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account. Under the terms
of the investment management trust agreement, up to $5.0 million of interest,
subject to adjustment, may be released to us in such amounts and at such
intervals as we request, subject to availability and to the maximum cap of 
$5.0 million, subject to adjustment. Although we do not know the rate of 
interest to be earned on the trust account and are unable to predict an exact 
amount of time it will take to complete an initial business combination, we 
believe that following the completion of this offering, it will take some time 
to find a prospective target and take all of the steps necessary to complete an
initial business combination. We anticipate that, even at an interest rate of 
2% per annum, the interest that will accrue on the trust account during the time 
it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient 
to fund our working capital requirements. However, if interest payments are not 
sufficient to fund these requirements, or are not available to fund the expenses
at the time we incur them, we may be required to seek loans or additional 
investments from our founding stockholder, executive officers or directors or 
from third parties. However, none of our founding stockholder, officers or 
directors or any third party is under any obligation to advance funds to us or
to invest in us in such circumstances.

If the underwriters determine the size of this offering should be increased or
they elect to exercise the over-allotment option, the amount of interest we may
withdraw from the trust account to fund our working capital will be increased
proportionately. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the amount per share held in trust reduces from $10.00 to $9.98. In
addition, assuming a 20% increase in the size of this offering, the per-share
conversion or liquidation price could decrease by as much as approximately
$0.03.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of our officers and directors and Greenhill employees, and also
that it may include engaging an accounting firm or other third-party
consultants. No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) will be paid to any of our officers or directors, or any of our or their
affiliates, for services rendered to us before or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination, including in connection with
such due diligence activities. However, our executive officers and directors,
founding stockholder and employees of Greenhill will receive reimbursement for
any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on a suitable initial business
combination, and Greenhill will be entitled to receive payments of an aggregate
of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services.
Our audit committee will review and approve all payments made to our founding
stockholder, our officers and directors and our or their affiliates, other than
the $10,000 per month payment described above, and any payments made to members
of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors,
with the interested director or directors abstaining from such review and
approval.

In addition, it is also possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in
the trust account to pay finder’s fees, consulting fees or other similar
compensation, or make a deposit, down payment or fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision
with respect to a particular proposed initial business combination, although we
do not have any current intention to do so. If we were ultimately required to
forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating
to such payment or otherwise), if the amount were large enough and we had
already used up the other funds available to us, we could be left with
insufficient funds to continue searching for other potential target businesses
or otherwise fund our business. In such case, if we were unable to secure
additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate an initial
business combination in the allotted time and be forced to liquidate.

We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income of up
to $5.0 million, subject to adjustment, earned on the trust account balance that
may be released to us will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses for which
such proceeds have been allocated. This belief is based on the fact that
in-depth due diligence will most likely be undertaken only after we have
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that
addresses the terms of our initial business combination. However, if our
estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our
initial business combination is less than the actual amount of such costs, we
may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost
of which is currently unascertainable. To the extent that such expenses exceed
the amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income of up to
$5.0 million, subject to adjustment, that may be released to us from the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate an initial business combination. While we do not expect that present
management will remain after our initial business combination, their role at 
such time, if any, is uncertain. Therefore, we have no current ability to 
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to present management after 
our initial business combination. Our executive officers and directors may, as 
part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of the 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed before the
initial business combination’s closing. If the target business’s owners did not
agree to such repayment, this could cause our executive officers and directors 
to view such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in a
conflict of interest.

On November 19, 2007, we issued a promissory note in the aggregate principal
amount of $250,000 to Greenhill. The note accrues interest at the rate of 8.5%
per annum, is unsecured and is due at the earlier of December 30, 2008, or the
consummation of this offering. The note (and any accrued interest thereon) will
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust
account.

We have agreed to pay Greenhill a total of $10,000 per month for office space,
administrative services and secretarial support. We believe that such fees are
at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.

To the extent that our capital stock or debt financing is used in whole or in
part as consideration to effect our initial business combination, any proceeds
held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be
used to finance the operations of the combined business.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
U.S. ‘‘government securities’’ (as such term is defined in the Investment
Company Act) and one or more money market funds, selected by us, which meet
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act,
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only (x) in the event of our liquidation if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the allotted time or (y) if the public stockholder
converts such shares into cash in connection with an initial business
combination that the public stockholder voted against that we consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind in or to funds in the trust account. The funds a public stockholder will be
entitled to receive from the trust account would include interest earned on his,
her or its portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable with respect to
such interest, and less interest income released to us from the trust account in
the manner described above and, in the event of our liquidation for failure to
consummate an initial business combination within the allotted time, interest of
up to $100,000 that may be released to us should we have no or insufficient
working capital to fund the costs and expenses of our dissolution and
liquidation.

On completion of an initial business combination, the underwriters will receive
the deferred underwriter’s discounts and commissions held in the trust account,
less pro-rata reductions resulting from the exercise of stockholder conversion
rights as described in this prospectus. If we do not complete an initial
business combination and the trustee must therefore distribute the balance in
the trust account on our liquidation, the underwriters have agreed (i) to
forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions, together with any accrued interest thereon, in the trust account,
and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to distribute the deferred underwriting
discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interest thereon, net of
income taxes payable on such interest and net of franchise taxes, on a pro rata
basis to the public stockholders."

the 5,100,000 shares of common stock in the offering. Our net proceeds from the
offering represent the amount we expect to receive after paying the underwriting
discounts and commissions and other expenses of the offering payable by us. We
will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholder.
 
We currently intend to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:
 
•  approximately $14.0 million – $20.0 million for the expansion of our sales 
   and marketing activities;                                                  
   
•  approximately $12.0 million – $18.0 million for continuation of our research
   and development activities;                                       
   
•  approximately $4.0 million payment to IBM, as required upon the initial    
   public offering of our common stock under the terms of our licensing 
   agreement with IBM; and                                                    
   
•  the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes.
 
We may also use a portion of the proceeds for acquisitions of products and
technologies that are complementary to our business, although we have no current
understandings, commitments or agreements to do so.
 
This expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts we
actually expend in these areas and the timing of our expenditures may vary
significantly from our current intentions and will depend upon a number of
factors, including the success of research and product development efforts for
version 2.0 of our TGS, our modular implants and other products, FDA clearance
for such products, changes in the number of sales and marketing personnel
necessary to achieve sales targets, future sales growth generally, cash
generated from future operations and actual expenses to operate our business. As
of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering.
Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
U.S. government securities and other short-term, investment-grade,
interest-bearing instruments or high-grade corporate notes."

offering will be approximately $46.3 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $9.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts

not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling
stockholders. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares to cover
over allotments is exercised in full, our net proceeds from this offering would
increase by approximately $7.5 million, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 
 
The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, obtain additional capital, facilitate our future access to the
public equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential
customers and improve our competitive position. We intend to use the net
proceeds to us from this offering for working capital and other general
corporate purposes. Additionally, we may choose to expand our current business
through acquisitions of or investments in other complementary businesses,
products or technologies, using cash or shares of our common stock. However, we
have no negotiations, agreements or commitments with respect to any such
acquisitions or investments at this time.
 
Pending use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds in
a variety of short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities. Our

  (1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
      FINRA filing fee, the blue sky filing fees and expenses and a portion of the
      legal and accounting fees, have been or will be paid from the funds we      
      received from our existing shareholders described below. These funds will be
      repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.                

  (2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
      founder warrants. $1,260,000, or $1,449,000 if the over-allotment option is 
      exercised in full, of the underwriting discounts and commissions will be    
      deposited in the trust account following the consummation of the offering   
      and is payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a business
      combination. In the event that a business combination is not consummated 
      within the required time period, that amount will be included in the 
      liquidating distribution to our public shareholders on a pro rata basis.                                            

  (3) The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in the trust account 
      will remain constant at $100,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In
      addition, $1,150,000 of interest income earned (net of taxes) on the amounts
      held in the trust account will be available to us to pay for our working    
      capital requirements. For purposes of presentation, the full amount         
      available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us
      immediately following the offering and the maximum amount of interest       
      released to us.                                                             

  (4) The miscellaneous fees and expenses may include, without limitation,        
      finders’ fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation, potential     
      deposits, down payments or funding of a “no-shop” provision with respect to 
      a particular business combination, D&O insurance, trustee’s fees in the     
      amount of a $1,000 initial acceptance fee and $3,000 in annual fees, and    
      dissolution obligations and reserves, if any.                               

Of the proceeds from this offering and the private placement, $36,000,000, or
$41,400,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of
which $1,260,000 (or $1,449,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) is attributable to the deferred underwriters’ discounts and
commissions, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. The
funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United States
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, in order to comply with certain exemptions under
the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest income (net of
taxes) that may be released to us of (i) up to $1,150,000 to fund expenses
related to investigating and selecting a target business and our other working
capital requirements, (ii) any additional amounts we may need to pay our income
tax obligations and (iii) amounts to be paid to converting shareholders voting
against the extended period, if any, upon approval by our shareholders, the
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The amounts held in the
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.

We have agreed to pay Bantry Bay Ventures-Asia, LLC a monthly fee of $7,500 for
general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement was agreed to by Bantry Bay Ventures-Asia,
LLC, an affiliate of Messrs. Zachs, Lee and Madame Quynh Anh, for our benefit,
and is not intended to provide such individuals compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe that, based on rents and fees for similar services in the
Hanoi, Vietnam area (and in Hartford, Connecticut with respect to certain
services), the fee charged by Bantry Bay Ventures-Asia, LLC is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party. Upon
completion of a business combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be
required to pay these monthly fees. Other than the $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting
or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our officers, directors, existing
shareholders or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination
(regardless of the form of such transaction). However, these persons will
receive reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us outside of the trust account for our
search for a business combination will be approximately $100,000. In addition,
interest earned (net of taxes) on the funds held in the trust account, up to
$1,150,000 may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements. These
funds will be used by us for director and officer liability insurance premiums,
due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred. We will also be entitled to have interest
earned (net of taxes) on the funds held in the trust account released to us to
pay any income tax obligations that we may owe. We believe these funds will be
sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use
a portion of the funds not being placed in the trust account to pay fees to 
consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down 
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent 
designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with
other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect 
to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any 
current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid 
for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that 
would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be 
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the 
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds 
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having 
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with 
respect to, potential target businesses.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire, or acquire control
of, a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent
that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a
business combination, the amounts held in the trust account which are not used
to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company
and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing,
research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be
used to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred
prior to the completion of our business combination if the funds available to us
outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Messrs. Zachs and Lee have agreed to advance us
the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no
more than approximately $75,000 to $125,000) and have agreed not to seek or
accept repayment of such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, Eric M. Zachs has advanced to us $200,100,
which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in
the line items above for the SEC registration fee, the FINRA registration fee
and legal and accounting fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without
interest and will be payable on the earlier of September 20, 2008 and the
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in the trust account.

The net proceeds of this offering which are not held in the trust account and
not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only
in United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued
by the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 36 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less interest income
released to us from the trust account in the manner described above) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we fail to complete a business combination
within the allotted time or (ii) if the public shareholder seeks to have us
convert such shares for cash in connection with (a) the proposal for the
extended period that the shareholder voted against and was actually approved by
our shareholders and/or (b) a business combination that the public shareholder
voted against and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will a
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust
account."

(1) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares of common  
    stock outstanding after the stock offering which could occur due to an       
    increase in the maximum of the independent valuation as a result of          
    regulatory considerations, demand for the shares, or changes in market       
    conditions or general economic conditions following the commencement of the

The net offering proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the
offering may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would
increase if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common
stock not purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering.

Initially, Cape Bancorp intends to invest the net offering proceeds not used to
acquire Boardwalk Bancorp in short-term liquid investments.

We are undertaking the offering at this time in order to increase our capital
and have the capital resources available to expand our business. For further
information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations of Cape Bancorp—Business Strategy.” The offering
proceeds will increase our capital resources and the amount of funds available
to us for lending and investment purposes. The proceeds will also give us
greater flexibility to expand our branch network and expand the products and
services we offer to our customers.

Cape Bancorp may use the proceeds it retains from the offering:

•  to finance the purchase of shares of common stock in the offering by the  
   employee stock ownership plan;                                            

•  to invest in securities;

•  to deposit funds in Cape Savings Bank;

•  to repurchase its shares of common stock;

•  to pay dividends to our stockholders;

•  to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches and other   
   financial services businesses, although there are no specific plans to do 
   so at this time, other than our acquisition of Boardwalk Bancorp; and     

•  for general corporate purposes.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations as applied by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, we may not repurchase shares of our common stock
during the first year following the offering, except when extraordinary
circumstances exist and with prior regulatory approval. The loan that will be
used to fund the purchases by the employee stock ownership plan will accrue
interest.

Cape Savings Bank intends to contribute up to $1.2 million in cash to The
CapeBank Charitable Foundation, and invest the remaining proceeds it receives
from the offering initially in short-term, liquid investments. Over time, Cape
Savings Bank may use the proceeds that it receives from the stock offering as
follows:

• to fund new loans, with an emphasis on commercial mortgage loans;

• to support new products and services;

• to expand its retail banking franchise by establishing de novo branches, by 
  acquiring existing branches, or by acquiring other financial institutions or 
  other financial services companies, although we have no specific plans to do 
  so at this time other than the acquisition of Boardwalk Bancorp;                                                        

• to invest in securities; and

• for general corporate purposes.

The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on changes in interest
rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial services
industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall
market conditions. We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to our
performance in recent years until we are able to utilize effectively the
additional capital raised in the stock offering. Until we can increase our net
interest income and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity to
remain below the industry average, which may negatively affect the value of our
common stock. A low return on equity may negatively affect the trading price of
our common stock.

Except as described above, neither Cape Bancorp nor Cape Savings Bank has any
specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this offering, and has not
allocated a specific portion of the proceeds to any particular use."

(1) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares of common  
    stock outstanding after the stock offering which could occur due to an       
    increase in the maximum of the independent valuation as a result of          
    regulatory considerations, demand for the shares, or changes in market       
    conditions or general economic conditions following the commencement of the  
    stock offering.                                                              

The net offering proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the
offering may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would
increase if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common
stock not purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering.

Initially, Cape Bancorp intends to invest the net offering proceeds not used to
acquire Boardwalk Bancorp in short-term liquid investments.

We are undertaking the offering at this time in order to increase our capital
and have the capital resources available to expand our business. For further
information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations of Cape Bancorp—Business Strategy.” The offering
proceeds will increase our capital resources and the amount of funds available
to us for lending and investment purposes. The proceeds will also give us
greater flexibility to expand our branch network and expand the products and
services we offer to our customers.

Cape Bancorp may use the proceeds it retains from the offering:

•  to finance the purchase of shares of common stock in the offering by the  
   employee stock ownership plan;                                            

•  to invest in securities;

•  to deposit funds in Cape Savings Bank;

•  to repurchase its shares of common stock;

•  to pay dividends to our stockholders;

•  to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches and other   
   financial services businesses, although there are no specific plans to do 
   so at this time, other than our acquisition of Boardwalk Bancorp; and     

•  for general corporate purposes.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations as applied by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, we may not repurchase shares of our common stock
during the first year following the offering, except when extraordinary
circumstances exist and with prior regulatory approval. The loan that will be
used to fund the purchases by the employee stock ownership plan will accrue
interest.

Cape Savings Bank intends to contribute up to $1.2 million in cash to The
CapeBank Charitable Foundation, and invest the remaining proceeds it receives
from the offering initially in short-term, liquid investments. Over time, Cape
Savings Bank may use the proceeds that it receives from the stock offering as
follows:

• to fund new loans, with an emphasis on commercial mortgage loans;

• to support new products and services;

• to expand its retail banking franchise by establishing de novo branches, by 
  acquiring existing branches, or by acquiring other financial institutions or 
  other financial services companies, although we have no specific plans to do 
  so at this time other than the acquisition of Boardwalk Bancorp;                                                        

• to invest in securities; and

• for general corporate purposes.

The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on changes in interest
rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial services
industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall
market conditions. We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to our
performance in recent years until we are able to utilize effectively the
additional capital raised in the stock offering. Until we can increase our net
interest income and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity to
remain below the industry average, which may negatively affect the value of our
common stock. A low return on equity may negatively affect the trading price of
our common stock.

Except as described above, neither Cape Bancorp nor Cape Savings Bank has any
specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this offering, and has not
allocated a specific portion of the proceeds to any particular use."

their common stock. If the selling stockholders exercise any warrants, we will
receive the amount of the exercise price. Based on the present exercise price of
$1.30 per share, if warrants to purchase a total of 1,612,500 shares of common
stock were to be exercised, we would receive gross proceeds of approximately
$2.1 million. We cannot assure you that any of the warrants will be exercised.
 
Further, the warrants include cashless exercise provisions that, if exercised,
would result in the issuance of shares of common stock equal to the value the
appreciation of the warrants without payment of any cash consideration. The
cashless exercise rights may not be exercised prior to September 12, 2008, and
thereafter can only be exercised if the underlying shares are not registered
under the Securities Act of 1933. We are only registering 1,612,500 shares of
common stock for issuance upon exercise of the warrants. Since we are not
registering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of all of
the warrants, the holders of those warrants for which we have not registered the
underlying shares, which cover the right to purchase 9,887,500 shares of common
stock, could have cashless exercise rights with respect to the underlying
shares."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the $175,000 advance  
    we received from John F.W. Hunt and Marc J. Blazer described below. This     
    advance will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed 
    in trust upon consummation of this offering.                                 

(2) The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain  
    constant at $50,000 even if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is       
    exercised. In addition, $1,80 million of interest income earned on the       
    amounts held in the trust account will be available to us to pay for our     
    working capital requirements potentially including the items described above.
    For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the
    total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the       
    offering.

    proposed initial business combination, director and officer liability        
    insurance premiums, brokers’ retainer fees, consulting fees, finders’ fees   
    and fees payable to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, for serving as  
    trustee and our transfer agent, rent and administrative expenses, and other  
    expenses not yet identified.                                                 

A total of approximately $150.5 million (or approximately $172.6 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the sponsors’ warrants described in this
prospectus, including $7.5 million (or approximately $8.63 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions will be placed in a trust account at
JPMorgan Chase Bank with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee.
Except for a portion of the interest income that may be released to us, or used
to pay taxes, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination
or our liquidation. All amounts held in the trust account that are not redeemed
for cash or released to us as interest income, or used to pay taxes, will be
released promptly after closing of our initial business combination with one or
more target businesses which collectively have a fair market value of at least
80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting
discounts and commissions of $7.5 million or approximately $8.63 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the time of such
business combination, subject to a majority of our public shareholders voting in
favor of the initial business combination and holders of less than 30% of the
shares sold in this offering electing to exercise their shareholder redemption
rights and subject to such deferred underwriting discounts and commissions
having been paid to the underwriters. We will only consummate a business
combination in which we become the controlling shareholder of the target. The
key factor that we will rely on in determining controlling shareholder status
would be our acquisition of at least 51% of the voting equity interests of the
target company. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such
criteria. Upon release of funds from the trust account and after payment of the
shareholder redemption price to any public shareholders who exercise their
shareholder redemption rights, the underwriters will receive their deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, and the remaining funds will be released
to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
business or businesses with which our initial combination occurs. If the initial
business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, we may apply
the cash released to us from the trust account to general corporate purposes,
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired business or
businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in
consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other
companies, or for working capital.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of the members of our management team and may include engaging
market research firms and/or third party consultants. No compensation of any
kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid to any of our initial
shareholders, sponsors, officers, directors, or special advisors or to any of
their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection
with the consummation of an initial business combination. However, these
individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our
audit committee will review and approve all expense reimbursements made to our
initial shareholders, sponsors, officers, directors or special advisors and our
and their respective affiliates and any payments made to members of our audit
committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the
interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval.

We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income of up
to $1.80 million earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us
subject to the tax holdback (as described in more detail below) will be 
sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. 
This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken 
only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary 
agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business combination. Although 
we do not know the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account and are 
unable to predict an exact amount of time it will take to complete any initial 
business combination, we believe that following the completion of this offering,
it will take a significant amount of time to find a prospective target business 
and take all of the steps necessary to complete an initial business combination.
We anticipate that, even at an interest rate of 3% per annum, the interest that
will accrue on the trust account during the time it will take to identify a 
target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working 
capital requirements. Given the limited amount of time it will take to generate
$1.80 million of interest on the trust account, we anticipate receiving such 
interest income generally shortly after we incur working capital expenses. 
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and 
negotiating an initial business combination is less than the actual amount 
necessary to do so, or if interest payments are not available to fund the 
expenses at the time we incur them, we may be required to raise additional 
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through 
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such 
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us. To the extent that our expenses exceed the amounts not held in 
the trust account and the interest income of up to $1.80 million that may be 
released to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be
reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. Since the 
role of our officers and directors after an initial business combination is 
uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any, 
will be paid to current officers and directors after our initial business 
combination. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such combination, 
negotiate the repayment of some or all of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by 
them that have not been reimbursed by us prior to the closing of our initial 
business combination. If the owners of the target business do not agree to such
repayment, this could cause our officers and directors to view such potential 
initial business combination unfavorably and result in a potential conflict of 
interest.

To the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect an initial business combination, the proceeds held in
the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to
finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could
be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of
the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, John F.W. Hunt and Marc J. Blazer advanced to
us a total of $175,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA
registration fee, American Stock Exchange fee and accounting and legal fees.
These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of
October 1, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid

this offering will be approximately $47.0 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We will not receive
any of the proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholder.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets.

    We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering as follows:

        º approximately $2.8 million of the proceeds from this offering will be
          used to repay in full a term loan with Silicon Valley Bank and to pay
          a success fee that we owe to Silicon Valley Bank in connection with
          this offering;

        º $5.0 million of the proceeds from this offering will be paid to former
          stockholders of PDSHeart holding certificates of subordinated
          contingent payment interest to fully extinguish our obligations under
          such certificates;

        º a portion of proceeds from this offering will be used for research and
          development, to build our inventory of future generations of our
          CardioNet System, increase our sales and marketing capabilities for
          our CardioNet System, hire additional personnel, invest in
          infrastructure and pursue new markets and geographies; and

        º a portion of the proceeds from this offering may be used to acquire or
          license products, technologies or businesses, but we currently have no
          agreements or commitments relating to material acquisitions or
          licenses.

    We anticipate using the remaining net proceeds to us from this offering for
working capital and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, our management will
have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds of this offering to
us, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding
the application of these proceeds.

    Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds to us from this
offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government.

    We believe that the net proceeds to us from this offering, together with
interest thereon, our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the forseeable
future."

this offering will be $17.3 billion, or $19.1 billion if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

We intend to deposit $3.0 billion into an escrow account from which settlements
of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable.

Following the completion of this offering, we intend to use $11.9 billion of the
net proceeds to redeem 132,989,608 shares of class B common stock and
144,217,005 shares of class C common stock, assuming no exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares.

We will use the balance of net proceeds for general corporate purposes. These
purposes may include funding the $1.146 billion aggregate redemption price for
all of the class C (series II) common stock, which we intend to redeem in
October 2008, and the $1.4 billion redemption price for 31,853,182 shares of
class C (series III) common stock, which we will be required to redeem in
October 2008 pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

In the event the underwriters exercise all or a portion of their option to
purchase an additional 40,600,000 shares of class A common stock, we intend to
redeem additional shares of class B common stock and class C (series I) common
stock following such exercise, in which case we would also redeem additional
shares of class C (series III) common stock in October 2008. The number of
shares of class B common stock, class C (series I) common stock and class C
(series III) common stock that would be redeemed would depend upon the number of
additional shares of class A common stock issued pursuant to any such exercise,
and would be proportional to the number of shares of the applicable class being
redeemed in the absence of any such exercise."

  (1) The offering expenses will be primarily funded from the proceeds of this    
      offering. All of the offering expenses to date have been paid from amounts  
      received pursuant to a revolving credit line from Robert Eu, our Chairman,  
      Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, as described below. These advances   
      will be repaid within 15 days after the consummation of this offering. The  
      advances will be paid from the proceeds of the offering and will not reduce 
      our working capital after the completion of this offering.                  

  (2) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
      of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.              

  (3) Indicates an offering expense partially or fully paid for by the revolving  
      credit line described in footnote 1. Currently, the following expenses have 
      been paid: $109,756 of legal fees; $30,000 of accounting fees; all of the   
      SEC and FINRA registration fees (an aggregate of $8,865); $16,031 of        
      printing and engraving expenses; and $11,488 of miscellaneous expenses      
      (which includes start-up costs, bank fees, printers and other expenses      
      related to background checks).                                              

  (4) Assumes that no additional interest earned on monies held in trust are      
      released during the extended period. Interest earned on monies held in trust
      and released to fund our working capital requirements are net of taxes paid 
      or payable.                                                                 

  (5) Although we would continue to pay administrative services fees through the  
      extended period if the extended period were approved, since the extended    
      period is subject to shareholder approval, the table only reflects the      
      amounts we would be required to pay in the event that shareholder approval  
      was not requested or obtained.                                              

A total of approximately $31.7 million (or approximately $36.3 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants described in
this prospectus, including $1,120,000 (or approximately $1,288,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, will be placed in a trust account at
HSBC with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company as trustee. We believe the
$339,135 funds initially available to us outside of the trust account, together
with the interest income on the balance of the trust account (up to a maximum of
$700,000, net of taxes paid or payable) to be released to us to fund our working
capital requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the
next 24 months, assuming a business combination is not completed during that
time.

Except for the interest income earned on the balance in the trust account to be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements and any amounts paid to
redeeming shareholders voting against the extended period upon approval by our
shareholders, the proceeds held in the trust account will not be released from
the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of a business
combination or our liquidation. All amounts held in the trust account that are
not:

 • distributed to public shareholders who exercise redemption rights;

 • released to us to pay taxes;

 • released to us as interest income; or

 • payable to the underwriters for deferred discounts and commissions, will be 
   released to us on closing of our initial business combination.

Our initial business combination will be with one or more target businesses that
have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account
(excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $1,120,000 or
approximately $1,288,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised
in full and taxes payable) at the time of such business combination, subject to:

•  a majority of our public shareholders voting in favor of the business      
   combination and one share less than 30.0% of the public shareholders electing 
   to exercise their redemption rights (on a cumulative basis); and  

•  such deferred underwriting discount and commission (less the portion of    
   such deferred underwriting discount and commissions paid to redeeming      
   shareholders) having been paid to the underwriters.                        

If our initial business combination involves a transaction in which we acquire
less than a 100% interest in the target company, the value of that interest that
we acquire will be equal to at least 80% of the sum of the balance in the trust
account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes
payable). In all instances, we would be the controlling shareholder of the
target company. The key factors that we will rely on in determining controlling
shareholder status would be our acquisition of at least 51% of the voting equity
interests of the target company and control of the majority of any governing
body of the target company. We will not consider any transaction that does not
meet such criteria.

We intend to acquire an operating business through a stock exchange, asset
acquisition or other similar business combination; however, there are a number
of industries in China in which direct foreign investment is restricted
(including telecommunications services, online commerce and advertising).
Therefore, if our target business is an industry that is subject to these
requirements we may seek to acquire control of our target business through
contractual arrangements with licensed companies operating in China and their
owners. We may enter into a business combination in which we, our subsidiaries
and/or affiliates, and the target business and its shareholders enter into a
series of contracts that are designed to secure for us economic benefits and to
assume by us the risks of losses that are substantially similar to full
ownership. These contracts could, for example, result in a structure where, in
exchange for our payment of the acquisition consideration, the target business
would be owned 100% by Chinese residents whom we designate, and the target
business would continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its
business. We may also establish a new subsidiary in China which would provide
technology, technical support, consulting and related services to the target
business in exchange for fees, which are designed to transfer to us
substantially all of the economic benefits of ownership of the target business.

On release of funds from the trust account and after payment of the redemption
price to any public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, the
underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions
(less the portion of such deferred underwriting discount or commissions paid to
redeeming shareholders), and the remaining funds will be released to us and can
be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
businesses with which our initial combination occurs. If the business
combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, we may apply the cash
released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of the acquired business or
businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in
consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other
companies, or for working capital.

We have agreed to pay to Hambrecht Eu Capital Management LLC, an affiliate of
Robert Eu, one of our founders and our Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and
Secretary, and Elizabeth Hambrecht, Mr. Eu’s wife, a total of $7,500 per month
for office space, administrative services and secretarial support beginning on
November 15, 2007 and continuing until the earlier of our consummation of a
business combination or our liquidation. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Hambrecht Eu Capital Management LLC for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Mr. Eu compensation in lieu of a management fee or other remuneration
because it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid by to Hambrecht Eu
Capital Management LLC will approximate the monthly reimbursement. We believe
that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. Upon consummation of a business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income
that may be released to us (up to a maximum of $700,000, net of taxes paid or
payable) will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds
are allocated for 24 months. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due
diligence will be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter
of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
our founders or our directors. None of such founders, or our directors is under
any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Robert Eu, our Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, provided us with
a $290,000 revolving credit line to pay the expenses of this offering referenced
in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA registration fee,
blue sky legal and filing fees and accounting and legal fees and expenses. As of
December 31, 2007, there was $281,661 outstanding under this revolving credit
line. These advances bear interest at a rate of 4% per year, are unsecured and
are due within 15 days following the consummation of this offering.

The net proceeds of this offering not immediately required for the purposes set
forth above will be invested only in United States “government securities” (as
such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) and one or more 
money market funds, selected by us, which invest principally in either 
short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United States having a rating 
in the highest investment category granted thereby by a recognized credit rating 
agency at the time of acquisition or short-term tax exempt municipal bonds 
issued by governmental entities located within the United States, so that we are
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The 
interest income on the trust account balance (up to $700,000, plus up to an 
additional $350,000 during the extended period if approved by shareholders, net
of taxes paid or payable) is releasable to us from the trust account from time
to time to fund a portion of our working capital and general corporate 
requirements.

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, we will not pay fees of any kind (including finder’s and
consulting fees) to any of our officers and directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our officers and directors
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There
are no limitations on the amount of expenses for which they can seek
reimbursement, provided such expenses were incurred for our benefit. We expect
that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be monitored or
performed by John Wang, Robert Eu and Stephen N. Cannon. Additionally, we may
engage market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our board of
directors will have the responsibility of reviewing and approving all expense
reimbursements made to our directors, with the interested director or directors
abstaining from such review and approval. To the extent that such expenses
exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest
income that is released to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination. These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination
business and would be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable
of the combined business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such
combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the
target business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our
directors to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in
a conflict of interest. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

A shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of income and franchise taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less
interest income released to us from the trust account in the manner described
above) only in the event of (i) our liquidation if we fail to complete a
business combination within the allotted time or (ii) if the public shareholder
seeks to have us redeem such shares for cash in connection with (a) the proposal
for the extended period that the shareholder voted against and was actually
approved by our shareholders and/or (b) a business combination that the public
shareholder voted against and that we actually complete. In no other
circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to
funds in the trust account.

On consummation of an initial business combination, the underwriters will
receive the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions held in the trust
account less the portion of such deferred underwriting discounts and commissions
paid to redeeming shareholders. If we do not complete an initial business
combination and the trustee must therefore distribute the balance in the trust
account on our liquidation, the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any
rights or claims to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions,

  (1) The offering expenses will be primarily funded from the proceeds of this    
      offering. All of the offering expenses to date have been paid from amounts  
      received pursuant to a revolving credit line from Robert Eu, our Chairman,  
      Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, as described below. These advances   
      will be repaid within 15 days after the consummation of this offering. The  
      advances will be paid from the proceeds of the offering and will not reduce 
      our working capital after the completion of this offering.                  

  (2) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
      of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.              

  (3) Indicates an offering expense partially or fully paid for by the revolving  
      credit line described in footnote 1. Currently, the following expenses have 
      been paid: $109,756 of legal fees; $30,000 of accounting fees; all of the   
      SEC and FINRA registration fees (an aggregate of $8,865); $16,031 of        
      printing and engraving expenses; and $11,488 of miscellaneous expenses      
      (which includes start-up costs, bank fees, printers and other expenses      
      related to background checks).                                              

  (4) Assumes that no additional interest earned on monies held in trust are      
      released during the extended period. Interest earned on monies held in trust
      and released to fund our working capital requirements are net of taxes paid 
      or payable.                                                                 

  (5) Although we would continue to pay administrative services fees through the  
      extended period if the extended period were approved, since the extended    
      period is subject to shareholder approval, the table only reflects the      
      amounts we would be required to pay in the event that shareholder approval  
      was not requested or obtained.                                              

A total of approximately $31.7 million (or approximately $36.3 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants described in
this prospectus, including $1,120,000 (or approximately $1,288,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, will be placed in a trust account at
HSBC with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company as trustee. We believe the
$339,135 funds initially available to us outside of the trust account, together
with the interest income on the balance of the trust account (up to a maximum of
$700,000, net of taxes paid or payable) to be released to us to fund our working
capital requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the
next 24 months, assuming a business combination is not completed during that
time.

Except for the interest income earned on the balance in the trust account to be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements and any amounts paid to
redeeming shareholders voting against the extended period upon approval by our
shareholders, the proceeds held in the trust account will not be released from
the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of a business
combination or our liquidation. All amounts held in the trust account that are
not:

 • distributed to public shareholders who exercise redemption rights;

 • released to us to pay taxes;

 • released to us as interest income; or

 • payable to the underwriters for deferred discounts and commissions, will be 
   released to us on closing of our initial business combination.

Our initial business combination will be with one or more target businesses that
have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account
(excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $1,120,000 or
approximately $1,288,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised
in full and taxes payable) at the time of such business combination, subject to:

•  a majority of our public shareholders voting in favor of the business      
   combination and one share less than 30.0% of the public shareholders electing 
   to exercise their redemption rights (on a cumulative basis); and  

•  such deferred underwriting discount and commission (less the portion of    
   such deferred underwriting discount and commissions paid to redeeming      
   shareholders) having been paid to the underwriters.                        

If our initial business combination involves a transaction in which we acquire
less than a 100% interest in the target company, the value of that interest that
we acquire will be equal to at least 80% of the sum of the balance in the trust
account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes
payable). In all instances, we would be the controlling shareholder of the
target company. The key factors that we will rely on in determining controlling
shareholder status would be our acquisition of at least 51% of the voting equity
interests of the target company and control of the majority of any governing
body of the target company. We will not consider any transaction that does not
meet such criteria.

We intend to acquire an operating business through a stock exchange, asset
acquisition or other similar business combination; however, there are a number
of industries in China in which direct foreign investment is restricted
(including telecommunications services, online commerce and advertising).
Therefore, if our target business is an industry that is subject to these
requirements we may seek to acquire control of our target business through
contractual arrangements with licensed companies operating in China and their
owners. We may enter into a business combination in which we, our subsidiaries
and/or affiliates, and the target business and its shareholders enter into a
series of contracts that are designed to secure for us economic benefits and to
assume by us the risks of losses that are substantially similar to full
ownership. These contracts could, for example, result in a structure where, in
exchange for our payment of the acquisition consideration, the target business
would be owned 100% by Chinese residents whom we designate, and the target
business would continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its
business. We may also establish a new subsidiary in China which would provide
technology, technical support, consulting and related services to the target
business in exchange for fees, which are designed to transfer to us
substantially all of the economic benefits of ownership of the target business.

On release of funds from the trust account and after payment of the redemption
price to any public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, the
underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions
(less the portion of such deferred underwriting discount or commissions paid to
redeeming shareholders), and the remaining funds will be released to us and can
be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
businesses with which our initial combination occurs. If the business
combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, we may apply the cash
released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of the acquired business or
businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in
consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other
companies, or for working capital.

We have agreed to pay to Hambrecht Eu Capital Management LLC, an affiliate of
Robert Eu, one of our founders and our Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and
Secretary, and Elizabeth Hambrecht, Mr. Eu’s wife, a total of $7,500 per month
for office space, administrative services and secretarial support beginning on
November 15, 2007 and continuing until the earlier of our consummation of a
business combination or our liquidation. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Hambrecht Eu Capital Management LLC for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Mr. Eu compensation in lieu of a management fee or other remuneration
because it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid by to Hambrecht Eu
Capital Management LLC will approximate the monthly reimbursement. We believe
that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. Upon consummation of a business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income
that may be released to us (up to a maximum of $700,000, net of taxes paid or
payable) will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds
are allocated for 24 months. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due
diligence will be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter
of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
our founders or our directors. None of such founders, or our directors is under
any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Robert Eu, our Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, provided us with
a $290,000 revolving credit line to pay the expenses of this offering referenced
in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA registration fee,
blue sky legal and filing fees and accounting and legal fees and expenses. As of
December 31, 2007, there was $281,661 outstanding under this revolving credit
line. These advances bear interest at a rate of 4% per year, are unsecured and
are due within 15 days following the consummation of this offering.

The net proceeds of this offering not immediately required for the purposes set
forth above will be invested only in United States “government securities” (as
such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) and one or more 
money market funds, selected by us, which invest principally in either 
short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United States having a rating 
in the highest investment category granted thereby by a recognized credit rating 
agency at the time of acquisition or short-term tax exempt municipal bonds 
issued by governmental entities located within the United States, so that we are
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The 
interest income on the trust account balance (up to $700,000, plus up to an 
additional $350,000 during the extended period if approved by shareholders, net
of taxes paid or payable) is releasable to us from the trust account from time
to time to fund a portion of our working capital and general corporate 
requirements.

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, we will not pay fees of any kind (including finder’s and
consulting fees) to any of our officers and directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our officers and directors
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There
are no limitations on the amount of expenses for which they can seek
reimbursement, provided such expenses were incurred for our benefit. We expect
that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be monitored or
performed by John Wang, Robert Eu and Stephen N. Cannon. Additionally, we may
engage market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our board of
directors will have the responsibility of reviewing and approving all expense
reimbursements made to our directors, with the interested director or directors
abstaining from such review and approval. To the extent that such expenses
exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest
income that is released to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination. These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination
business and would be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable
of the combined business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such
combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the
target business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our
directors to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in
a conflict of interest. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

A shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of income and franchise taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less
interest income released to us from the trust account in the manner described
above) only in the event of (i) our liquidation if we fail to complete a
business combination within the allotted time or (ii) if the public shareholder
seeks to have us redeem such shares for cash in connection with (a) the proposal
for the extended period that the shareholder voted against and was actually
approved by our shareholders and/or (b) a business combination that the public
shareholder voted against and that we actually complete. In no other
circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to
funds in the trust account.

On consummation of an initial business combination, the underwriters will
receive the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions held in the trust
account less the portion of such deferred underwriting discounts and commissions
paid to redeeming shareholders. If we do not complete an initial business
combination and the trustee must therefore distribute the balance in the trust
account on our liquidation, the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any
rights or claims to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions,
together with any accrued interest thereon, in the trust account and (ii) that
the trustee is authorized to distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions, together with any accrued interest thereon, net of income and
franchise taxes payable on such interest, to the public shareholders on a pro
rata basis."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $222.2 million
(or approximately $255.7 million if the underwriters fully exercise the
over-allotment option) after deducting the underwriting discount of
approximately $16.8 million (or approximately $19.3 million if the underwriters
fully exercise the over-allotment option), and estimated offering expenses of
approximately $1.0 million payable by us.

We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering to acquire agency securities
that are three-year, five-year and seven-year hybrid ARMs and currently intend
to invest the proceeds in a targeted mix of 15% to 30% three-year hybrid ARMs,
40% to 60% five-year hybrid ARMs and 15% to 30% seven-year hybrid ARMs. We
expect then to borrow against the agency securities through repurchase
agreements and use the proceeds of the borrowings to acquire additional agency
securities in accordance with the same targeted allocation. We reserve the right
to change our targeted allocation depending on prevailing market conditions,
including, among others, the pricing and supply of agency securities, the
performance of our portfolio and the availability and terms of financing.

Pending these uses, we intend to maintain the net offering proceeds in
interest-bearing, short-term, marketable investment grade securities or money
market accounts or (interest or non-interest bearing) checking (or escrow
accounts) that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. These
investments may include, for example, government securities other than agency
securities, certificates of deposit and interest-bearing bank deposits.

Although we do not intend to use any of the net proceeds from this offering to
fund distributions to our stockholders, to the extent we use these net proceeds
to fund distributions, these payments may be treated as a return of capital to
our stockholders."

expenses which were paid in 2007. For purposes of estimating our net proceeds,
we have assumed no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares of common stock.

We expect to apply the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

† approximately $757.4 million (approximately 84.4% of the net proceeds from
  this offering) will be paid to Intrepid Mining (together with 40,339,000  
  shares of our common stock) in exchange for all of Intrepid Mining’s assets 
  other than cash;                                                   

† based on outstanding amounts as of December 31, 2007, approximately $82.5 
  million (approximately 9.2% of the net proceeds from this offering) will be 
  used by us for repayment of debt assumed from Intrepid Mining pursuant to the
  exchange agreement, leaving us with no outstanding debt; and       

† the remainder of the net proceeds, $59.5 million of cash in the December 31, 
  2007 pro forma combined as adjusted balance sheet, will be used to fund 
  production expansions and other growth opportunities and for general corporate 
  purposes.                                               

We will assume (i) all amounts in excess of $18.9 million of Intrepid Mining’s
liability under its existing senior credit facility and (ii) all other
liabilities and obligations of Intrepid Mining, as described in the exchange
agreement discussed under “The Formation Transactions”. As of December 31, 2007,
the total debt outstanding under the existing senior credit facility was $101.4
million, which bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 6.62%. As of
March 31, 2008, Intrepid Mining had $101.9 million outstanding under the
existing senior credit facility. The $125.0 million revolving portion of the
existing senior credit facility matures on March 9, 2012, and the $50.0 million
term loan portion matures on March 9, 2014, with required payments of $1.25
million due quarterly until maturity. As of the date of this prospectus, we have
received approval to further amend the facility to accommodate the repayment and
cancellation of the term loan. With the repayment of the term loan, we will have
full availability under our $125 million revolving senior credit facility. The
existing senior credit facility was refinanced on March 9, 2007 to permit the
redemption by Intrepid Mining of the membership interests of Long Canyon, LLC
and to provide available credit for our capital spending program. The net
proceeds we receive from the exercise of the option to purchase additional
shares will be used to pay the formation distribution to Intrepid Mining. Any
amount of the formation distribution that is not paid in cash will be paid in
shares of our common stock.

After the completion of this offering, Intrepid Mining will liquidate and
distribute its remaining assets, including the cash and common stock received
pursuant to the exchange agreement and the right to receive the formation
distribution, to the current members of Intrepid Mining."

Futures Contracts and Other Heating Oil-Related Investments Treasuries, cash and
cash equivalents. The General Partner has sole authority to determine the
percentage of assets that will be:

 • held on deposit with the futures commission merchant or other custodian,

 • used for other investments, and

 • held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

The General Partner expects to deposit most of USHO’s net assets with the
Custodian or other custodian for trading. When USHO purchases a Futures Contract
and certain exchange traded Other Heating Oil-Related Investments, USHO is
required to deposit with the futures commission merchant on behalf of the
exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to
ensure payment for the obligation under Heating Oil Interests at maturity. This
deposit is known as “margin.” USHO will invest the remainder of its assets equal
to the difference between the margin deposited and the face value of the Futures
Contract in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.

The General Partner expects that all entities that will hold or trade USHO’s
assets will be based in the United States and will be subject to United States
regulations.

The General Partner believes that 5% to 10% of USHO’s assets will normally be
committed as margin for commodity futures contracts. However, from time to time,
the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less,
than such range. The General Partner intends to invest the balance of USHO’s
assets not invested in Heating Oil Interests or held in margin as reserves to be
available for changes in margin. All interest income will be used for USHO’s
benefit.

The futures commission merchant, a government agency or a commodity exchange
could increase margins applicable to USHO to hold trading positions at any time.
Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit
or loss potential for any positions taken.

     Malvern Federal Bancorp intends to invest 100% of the proceeds it retains
from the offering initially in short-term, liquid investments. Although there
can be no assurance that Malvern Federal Bancorp will invest the net proceeds in
anything other than short-term, liquid investments, over time, Malvern Federal
Bancorp may use the proceeds it retains from the offering:

                                                                                  
     •    to invest in investment securities;                                     
                                                                                  
     •    to fund the payment of cash dividends to stockholders;                  
                                                                                  
     •    to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory         
          restrictions;                                                           
                                                                                  
     •    to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions or other  
          businesses related to banking, although we have no specific plans       
          regarding any acquisitions at this time; and                            
                                                                                  
     •    for general corporate purposes.                                         


     Under current applicable regulations, Malvern Federal Bancorp may not
repurchase shares of its common stock during the first year following the
reorganization, except to fund equity benefit plans or, with prior regulatory
approval, when extraordinary circumstances exist. We do not anticipate making
any stock repurchases during the first year after our reorganization except to
fund our recognition and retention plan upon approval by our shareholders.

     We believe it is the right time for us to reorganize and issue stock in the
offering as we believe that there continues to be opportunities for us to grow
our loan portfolio, particularly commercial real estate and construction and
development loans, and the net proceeds from the offering will further
strengthen our capital position and enhance our ability to originate additional
new loans. The increased capital from the offering proceeds also will enable us 
to make larger loans than we have been able to in the past, and we believe that
this will help us in our efforts to be more competitive and to solicit new loans
in our market area. In recent periods we have added personnel in our lending, 
accounting and administrative functions in anticipation of growth. We believe 
the net proceeds will facilitate our growth in accordance with our plans. 
Finally, as a result of the consolidation in the banking industry and the 
potential effect of the continuing market competition, we believe that we may 
have opportunities to acquire other financial institutions in the future, and 
the proceeds from the offering as well as our reorganization to the mutual 
holding company form will facilitate our ability to consider acquisitions in the
future (although we have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements 
regarding any acquisition).

     Malvern Federal Savings Bank intends to initially use the net proceeds it
receives to fund loans and make short-term investments. In the future, Malvern
Federal Savings Bank may use the proceeds that it receives from the offering,
which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to Malvern Federal
Savings Bank:
                                                                                  
• to fund new loans;                                                      
                                                                                  
• to finance the possible expansion of its network of financial center offices;
  and                                                            
                                                                                  
• for general corporate purposes.                                         

We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed
above.

     Except as described above, neither Malvern Federal Bancorp nor Malvern
Federal Savings Bank has any specific plans for the investment of the net
proceeds of this offering and has not allocated a specific portion of the
proceeds to any particular use."

     Under current applicable regulations, Malvern Federal Bancorp may not
repurchase shares of its common stock during the first year following the
reorganization, except to fund equity benefit plans or, with prior regulatory
approval, when extraordinary circumstances exist. We do not anticipate making
any stock repurchases during the first year after our reorganization except to
fund our recognition and retention plan upon approval by our shareholders.

     We believe it is the right time for us to reorganize and issue stock in the
offering as we believe that there continues to be opportunities for us to grow
our loan portfolio, particularly commercial real estate and construction and
development loans, and the net proceeds from the offering will further
strengthen our capital position and enhance our ability to originate additional
new loans. The increased capital from the offering proceeds also will enable us 
to make larger loans than we have been able to in the past, and we believe that
this will help us in our efforts to be more competitive and to solicit new loans
in our market area. In recent periods we have added personnel in our lending, 
accounting and administrative functions in anticipation of growth. We believe 
the net proceeds will facilitate our growth in accordance with our plans. 
Finally, as a result of the consolidation in the banking industry and the 
potential effect of the continuing market competition, we believe that we may 
have opportunities to acquire other financial institutions in the future, and 
the proceeds from the offering as well as our reorganization to the mutual 
holding company form will facilitate our ability to consider acquisitions in the
future (although we have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements 
regarding any acquisition).

     Malvern Federal Savings Bank intends to initially use the net proceeds it
receives to fund loans and make short-term investments. In the future, Malvern
Federal Savings Bank may use the proceeds that it receives from the offering,
which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to Malvern Federal
Savings Bank:
                                                                                  
• to fund new loans;                                                      
                                                                                  
• to finance the possible expansion of its network of financial center offices;
  and

above.

Federal Savings Bank has any specific plans for the investment of the net

     Malvern Federal Bancorp intends to invest 100% of the proceeds it retains
from the offering initially in short-term, liquid investments. Although there
can be no assurance that Malvern Federal Bancorp will invest the net proceeds in
anything other than short-term, liquid investments, over time, Malvern Federal
Bancorp may use the proceeds it retains from the offering:

                                                                                  
     •    to invest in investment securities;                                     
                                                                                  
     •    to fund the payment of cash dividends to stockholders;                  
                                                                                  
     •    to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory         
          restrictions;                                                           
                                                                                  
     •    to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions or other  
          businesses related to banking, although we have no specific plans       
          regarding any acquisitions at this time; and                            
                                                                                  
     •    for general corporate purposes.                                         


     Under current applicable regulations, Malvern Federal Bancorp may not
repurchase shares of its common stock during the first year following the
reorganization, except to fund equity benefit plans or, with prior regulatory
approval, when extraordinary circumstances exist. We do not anticipate making
any stock repurchases during the first year after our reorganization except to
fund our recognition and retention plan upon approval by our shareholders.

     We believe it is the right time for us to reorganize and issue stock in the
offering as we believe that there continues to be opportunities for us to grow
our loan portfolio, particularly commercial real estate and construction and
development loans, and the net proceeds from the offering will further
strengthen our capital position and enhance our ability to originate additional
new loans. The increased capital from the offering proceeds also will enable us 
to make larger loans than we have been able to in the past, and we believe that
this will help us in our efforts to be more competitive and to solicit new loans
in our market area. In recent periods we have added personnel in our lending, 
accounting and administrative functions in anticipation of growth. We believe 
the net proceeds will facilitate our growth in accordance with our plans. 
Finally, as a result of the consolidation in the banking industry and the 
potential effect of the continuing market competition, we believe that we may 
have opportunities to acquire other financial institutions in the future, and 
the proceeds from the offering as well as our reorganization to the mutual 
holding company form will facilitate our ability to consider acquisitions in the
future (although we have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements 
regarding any acquisition).

     Malvern Federal Savings Bank intends to initially use the net proceeds it
receives to fund loans and make short-term investments. In the future, Malvern
Federal Savings Bank may use the proceeds that it receives from the offering,
which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to Malvern Federal
Savings Bank:
                                                                                  
• to fund new loans;                                                      
                                                                                  
• to finance the possible expansion of its network of financial center offices;
  and                                                            
                                                                                  
• for general corporate purposes.                                         

We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed
above.

     Except as described above, neither Malvern Federal Bancorp nor Malvern
Federal Savings Bank has any specific plans for the investment of the net
proceeds of this offering and has not allocated a specific portion of the
proceeds to any particular use."

  (1) The offering expenses will be primarily funded from the proceeds of this    
      offering. All of the offering expenses to date have been paid from advances 
      we received from our founders as described below. Pursuant to promissory    
      notes between us and our founders, we will repay $30,000 of these advances  
      upon the earlier of (i) consummation of this offering or (ii) May 15, 2008  
      and we will repay $40,000 of these advances upon the earlier to occur of (i)
      the consummation of this offering and (ii) July 15, 2008.                   

  (2) If the underwriters determine that the size of this offering should be      
      increased or decreased, or the underwriters exercise their over-allotment   
      option, the amount of interest income earned on the trust account that can
      be released to us to fund our working capital will be proportionately 
      adjusted. The amount of interest income permitted to be released from the
      trust account may be increased by up to $to be advised to the extent the 
      over-allotment is exercised in full.                          

  (3) Represents 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the units in this    
      offering that will be paid to the underwriters’ only upon consummation of a 
      business combination. If a business combination is not consummated and we   
      are liquidated, such amounts will be disbursed among our public             
      shareholders.                                                               

A total of approximately $30.0 million (or approximately $34.3 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants described in
this prospectus, and $1,050,000 (or $1,207,500 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions, will be placed in a trust account at the London branch of
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company. We believe the $150,000 of funds initially available to us outside the
trust account, together with the interest income, net of taxes, on the balance
of the trust account to be released to us to fund our working capital and
general corporate requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at
least the next 36 months, assuming a business combination is not completed
during that time. If the underwriters determine the size of this offering should
be increased, or the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, it could
also result in a proportionate increase in the amount of interest we may
withdraw from the trust account.

Except for up to an aggregate of $0.85 million of the interest income, subject
to adjustment, net of taxes, earned on the balance in the trust account to be
released to us to fund our working capital and general corporate requirements
and any amounts paid to redeeming shareholders voting against the extended
period, if any, upon approval by our shareholders, the proceeds held in the
trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. If the
underwriters determine that the size of this offering should be increased, the
amount of interest income earned on the trust account that can be released to us
to fund our working capital will be increased proportionately. All amounts held
in the trust account that are not:

 • distributed to public shareholders who exercise redemption rights,


 • released to us to pay taxes;


 • released to us as interest income, or


 • payable to the underwriters for deferred discounts and commissions,
will be released to us on closing of our initial business combination.

Our initial business combination will be with one or more target businesses that
have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account
(excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $1,050,000 or
$1,207,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) both
at the time of the execution of definitive documentation with respect to a
proposed business combination and immediately prior to the consummation of the
business combination, subject to:

   •   approval of a majority of our ordinary shares voted by our public          
       shareholders (including our existing shareholders with respect to shares   
       purchased in this offering or otherwise acquired in the public markets by  
       them) and public shareholders holding less than 35.0% of the ordinary      
       shares sold in this offering electing to exercise their redemption rights  
       (on a cumulative basis in connection with the extended period and the      
       business combination); and                                                 

   •   such deferred underwriting discount and commission having been paid to the 
       underwriters.                                                              

If our initial business combination involves a transaction in which we acquire
less than a 100% interest in the target company, the value of that interest that
we acquire will be equal to at least 80% of the sum of the balance in the trust
account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions). In all
instances, we would be the controlling shareholder of the target company. The
key factors that we will rely on in determining controlling shareholder status
would be our acquisition of at least 51% of the voting equity interests of the
target company and control of the majority of any governing body of the target
company. Except as described in the following paragraph, we will not consider
any transaction that does not meet such criteria.

We intend to acquire an operating business in the PRC through a stock exchange,
asset acquisition or other similar business combination. Our efforts in
identifying a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular
industry. However, there are a number of industries in China in which direct
foreign investment is restricted (including telecommunications services, online
commerce and advertising). Therefore, if our target business is an industry that
is subject to these requirements we may seek to acquire control of our target
business through contractual arrangements with licensed companies operating in
China and their owners. We may enter into a business combination in which we,
our subsidiaries and/or affiliates, and the target business and its shareholders
enter into a series of contracts that are designed to secure for us economic
benefits and to assume by us the risks of losses that are substantially similar
to full ownership, although we would not be allowed to own the assets or obtain
direct control of an operating company in a restricted industry in China. These
contracts could, for example, result in a structure where, in exchange for our
payment of the acquisition consideration, the target business would be owned
100% by Chinese residents whom we designate, and the target business would
continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its business. We
may also establish a new subsidiary in China which would provide technology,
technical support, consulting and related services to the target business in
exchange for fees, which are designed to transfer to us substantially all of the
economic benefits of ownership of the target business.

On release of funds from the trust account and after payment of the redemption
price to any public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, the
underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions,
and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a
portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our
initial combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for using stock
or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account
for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of
operations of the acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital.

We have agreed to pay Olympic Spring Limited, a company jointly and equally
owned by Chun Yi Hao and Hope Ni, a total of $7,500 per month for office space,
administrative services and secretarial support for a period commencing on the
date of this prospectus and ending on our consummation of a business
combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by Olympic Spring Limited for
our benefit and is not intended to provide Olympic Spring Limited compensation
in lieu of a management fee or other remuneration because it is anticipated that
the expenses to be paid by Olympic Spring Limited will approximate the monthly
reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon consummation of a business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income
that may be released to us (as described in more detail below) will be
sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated.
This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken
only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary
agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our
estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a
business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may
be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of
which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from our founders. None of our
founders is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Our founders have provided us with $70,000 in loans to pay the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA
registration fee and certain accounting and legal fees and expenses. Advances
under the loans are non-interest bearing and unsecured. Of these advances,
$30,000 is due upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of this offering or (ii)
May 15, 2008, and $40,000 is due upon the earlier to occur of (i) the
consummation of this offering or (ii) July 15, 2008. The loans will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering not placed in the trust account.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
U.S. “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
that only invest in government securities having a maturity of 180 days or less
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment 
Company Act. Up to an aggregate of $0.85 million, subject to adjustment, of the
interest income, net of taxes, on the trust account balance is releasable to us 
from the trust account to fund a portion of our working capital and general 
corporate requirements.

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) will be paid to Chun Yi Hao and Hope Ni or our other directors, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our officers and directors
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be monitored or
performed by Mr. Hao and Ms. Ni. Additionally, we may engage market research
firms and/or third party consultants. Our board of directors will have the
responsibility of reviewing and approving all expense reimbursements made to our
officers and directors. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest income that is released
to us from the trust account, Mr. Hao and Ms. Ni have agreed in writing in
letter agreements to satisfy any such shortfall. Such out-of-pocket expenses by
Mr. Hao and Ms. Ni would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination. These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination
business and would be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable
of the combined business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such
combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the
target business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our
directors to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in
a conflict of interest. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

A shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less interest income
released to us from the trust account in the manner described above) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we fail to complete a business combination
within the allotted time or (ii) if the public shareholder seeks to have us
redeem such shares for cash in connection with (a) the proposal for the extended
period that the shareholder voted against and was actually approved by our
shareholders and/or (b) a business combination that the public shareholder voted
against and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will a
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust
account.

On consummation of an initial business combination, the underwriters will
receive the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust
account. If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee
must therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation,
the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interest
thereon, in the trust account and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to
distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with
any accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, to
the public shareholders on a pro rata basis."

  (1) The offering expenses will be primarily funded from the proceeds of this    
      offering. All of the offering expenses to date have been paid from advances 
      we received from our founders as described below. Pursuant to promissory    
      notes between us and our founders, we will repay $30,000 of these advances  
      upon the earlier of (i) consummation of this offering or (ii) May 15, 2008  
      and we will repay $40,000 of these advances upon the earlier to occur of (i)
      the consummation of this offering and (ii) July 15, 2008.                   

  (2) If the underwriters determine that the size of this offering should be      
      increased or decreased, or the underwriters exercise their over-allotment   
      option, the amount of interest income earned on the trust account that can
      be released to us to fund our working capital will be proportionately 
      adjusted. The amount of interest income permitted to be released from the
      trust account may be increased by up to $to be advised to the extent the 
      over-allotment is exercised in full.                          

  (3) Represents 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the units in this    
      offering that will be paid to the underwriters’ only upon consummation of a 
      business combination. If a business combination is not consummated and we   
      are liquidated, such amounts will be disbursed among our public             
      shareholders.                                                               

A total of approximately $30.0 million (or approximately $34.3 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants described in
this prospectus, and $1,050,000 (or $1,207,500 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions, will be placed in a trust account at the London branch of
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company. We believe the $150,000 of funds initially available to us outside the
trust account, together with the interest income, net of taxes, on the balance
of the trust account to be released to us to fund our working capital and
general corporate requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at
least the next 36 months, assuming a business combination is not completed
during that time. If the underwriters determine the size of this offering should
be increased, or the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, it could
also result in a proportionate increase in the amount of interest we may
withdraw from the trust account.

Except for up to an aggregate of $0.85 million of the interest income, subject
to adjustment, net of taxes, earned on the balance in the trust account to be
released to us to fund our working capital and general corporate requirements
and any amounts paid to redeeming shareholders voting against the extended
period, if any, upon approval by our shareholders, the proceeds held in the
trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. If the
underwriters determine that the size of this offering should be increased, the
amount of interest income earned on the trust account that can be released to us
to fund our working capital will be increased proportionately. All amounts held
in the trust account that are not:

 • distributed to public shareholders who exercise redemption rights,


 • released to us to pay taxes;


 • released to us as interest income, or


 • payable to the underwriters for deferred discounts and commissions,
will be released to us on closing of our initial business combination.

Our initial business combination will be with one or more target businesses that
have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account
(excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $1,050,000 or
$1,207,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) both
at the time of the execution of definitive documentation with respect to a
proposed business combination and immediately prior to the consummation of the
business combination, subject to:

   •   approval of a majority of our ordinary shares voted by our public          
       shareholders (including our existing shareholders with respect to shares   
       purchased in this offering or otherwise acquired in the public markets by  
       them) and public shareholders holding less than 35.0% of the ordinary      
       shares sold in this offering electing to exercise their redemption rights  
       (on a cumulative basis in connection with the extended period and the      
       business combination); and                                                 

   •   such deferred underwriting discount and commission having been paid to the 
       underwriters.                                                              

If our initial business combination involves a transaction in which we acquire
less than a 100% interest in the target company, the value of that interest that
we acquire will be equal to at least 80% of the sum of the balance in the trust
account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions). In all
instances, we would be the controlling shareholder of the target company. The
key factors that we will rely on in determining controlling shareholder status
would be our acquisition of at least 51% of the voting equity interests of the
target company and control of the majority of any governing body of the target
company. Except as described in the following paragraph, we will not consider
any transaction that does not meet such criteria.

We intend to acquire an operating business in the PRC through a stock exchange,
asset acquisition or other similar business combination. Our efforts in
identifying a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular
industry. However, there are a number of industries in China in which direct
foreign investment is restricted (including telecommunications services, online
commerce and advertising). Therefore, if our target business is an industry that
is subject to these requirements we may seek to acquire control of our target
business through contractual arrangements with licensed companies operating in
China and their owners. We may enter into a business combination in which we,
our subsidiaries and/or affiliates, and the target business and its shareholders
enter into a series of contracts that are designed to secure for us economic
benefits and to assume by us the risks of losses that are substantially similar
to full ownership, although we would not be allowed to own the assets or obtain
direct control of an operating company in a restricted industry in China. These
contracts could, for example, result in a structure where, in exchange for our
payment of the acquisition consideration, the target business would be owned
100% by Chinese residents whom we designate, and the target business would
continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its business. We
may also establish a new subsidiary in China which would provide technology,
technical support, consulting and related services to the target business in
exchange for fees, which are designed to transfer to us substantially all of the
economic benefits of ownership of the target business.

On release of funds from the trust account and after payment of the redemption
price to any public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, the
underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions,
and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a
portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our
initial combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for using stock
or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account
for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of
operations of the acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital.

We have agreed to pay Olympic Spring Limited, a company jointly and equally
owned by Chun Yi Hao and Hope Ni, a total of $7,500 per month for office space,
administrative services and secretarial support for a period commencing on the
date of this prospectus and ending on our consummation of a business
combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by Olympic Spring Limited for
our benefit and is not intended to provide Olympic Spring Limited compensation
in lieu of a management fee or other remuneration because it is anticipated that
the expenses to be paid by Olympic Spring Limited will approximate the monthly
reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon consummation of a business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income
that may be released to us (as described in more detail below) will be
sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated.
This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken
only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary
agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our
estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a
business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may
be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of
which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from our founders. None of our
founders is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Our founders have provided us with $70,000 in loans to pay the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA
registration fee and certain accounting and legal fees and expenses. Advances
under the loans are non-interest bearing and unsecured. Of these advances,
$30,000 is due upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of this offering or (ii)
May 15, 2008, and $40,000 is due upon the earlier to occur of (i) the
consummation of this offering or (ii) July 15, 2008. The loans will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering not placed in the trust account.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
U.S. “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
that only invest in government securities having a maturity of 180 days or less
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment 
Company Act. Up to an aggregate of $0.85 million, subject to adjustment, of the
interest income, net of taxes, on the trust account balance is releasable to us 
from the trust account to fund a portion of our working capital and general 
corporate requirements.

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) will be paid to Chun Yi Hao and Hope Ni or our other directors, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our officers and directors
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be monitored or
performed by Mr. Hao and Ms. Ni. Additionally, we may engage market research
firms and/or third party consultants. Our board of directors will have the
responsibility of reviewing and approving all expense reimbursements made to our
officers and directors. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest income that is released
to us from the trust account, Mr. Hao and Ms. Ni have agreed in writing in
letter agreements to satisfy any such shortfall. Such out-of-pocket expenses by
Mr. Hao and Ms. Ni would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination. These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination
business and would be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable
of the combined business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such
combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the
target business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our
directors to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in
a conflict of interest. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

A shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less interest income
released to us from the trust account in the manner described above) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we fail to complete a business combination
within the allotted time or (ii) if the public shareholder seeks to have us
redeem such shares for cash in connection with (a) the proposal for the extended
period that the shareholder voted against and was actually approved by our
shareholders and/or (b) a business combination that the public shareholder voted
against and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will a
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust
account.

On consummation of an initial business combination, the underwriters will
receive the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust
account. If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee
must therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation,
the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interest
thereon, in the trust account and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to
distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with
any accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, to
the public shareholders on a pro rata basis."
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/agnc-investment-corp-770217-57657,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/agnc-investment-corp-770217-57657,424B4,5/16/2008,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=5942357,"We are offering 10,000,000 shares of our common stock at the initial public
offering price of $20.00 per share. Concurrently, we are selling American
Capital $100 million of our common stock, at the initial public offering price,
in a private placement. We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from
selling common stock in this offering and the concurrent private placement to
American Capital will be approximately $286.2 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of
approximately $13.8 million (or, if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, approximately $314.3 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of
approximately $15.7 million).

We plan to use all the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement to American Capital in conjunction with borrowings under our
master repurchase agreements consistent with our leverage threshold to build a
leveraged investment portfolio comprised exclusively of agency securities. We
currently expect that at least 75% of our initial leveraged investment portfolio
will consist of fixed-rate pass-through certificates and the remaining 25% will
consist of a combination of (i) additional fixed-rate pass-through certificates,
(ii) ARM or hybrid ARM pass-through certificates, and (iii) CMOs.

We expect to deploy the net proceeds on a leveraged basis within 90 days of the
closing of this offering. Depending on the economic environment and our outlook
for the mortgage market at the time we ultimately deploy the net proceeds on a
leveraged basis, the percentage allocations of agency securities, including
fixed rate, ARM and hybrid ARM pass-through certificates and CMOs, within our
initial leveraged investment portfolio may differ from the currently expected
allocations described above. 

Depending on the availability of our targeted investments in agency securities
within the 90 days following the closing of this offering, we may temporarily
invest the net proceeds in readily marketable, short-term, interest-bearing
investments, including money market accounts, that are consistent with our
intention to qualify as a REIT. These temporary investments are expected to

and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $153.3 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay $137.9 million 
of the $250.0 million outstanding under the senior unsecured term loan facility 
of Verso Paper Finance Holdings LLC, and the $1.4 million prepayment penalty 
related thereto. The net proceeds from the incurrence of the senior unsecured 
term loan facility by Verso Paper Finance Holdings LLC were distributed to our 
equity holders. The senior unsecured term loan facility matures on February 1, 
2013, and accrues interest at rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, 
or “LIBOR,” plus 6.25%. Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC, an affiliate of Credit 
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, and J.P. Morgan Whitefriars Inc., an affiliate of 
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., are lenders under the Verso Paper Finance Holdings 
LLC senior unsecured term loan facility in the amounts of $17.5 million and $10.0
million, respectively, and therefore will receive proceeds from this offering.

We intend to use $14.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to repay the
outstanding $4.0 million under the revolving credit facility and $10.0 million 
senior secured term loan of our subsidiary, Verso Fiber Farm LLC. The revolving 
credit facility and senior secured term loan of Verso Fiber Farm LLC each mature 
on August 1, 2010, and accrue interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.00%. One 
or more affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC are lenders under these 
facilities and therefore will receive proceeds from this offering. 

Any additional amounts raised as a result of additional shares sold by us in 
connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 
additional shares from us will be used to repay amounts outstanding under the 
senior unsecured term loan facility of our subsidiary, Verso Paper Finance 
Holdings LLC, including the 1.0% prepayment penalty related thereto."

these proceeds to (i) make a loan of $260.0 million to Anadarko in exchange for
a 30-year note bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.5%, (ii) reimburse
Anadarko for $14.3 million of capital expenditures it incurred with respect to

commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately
$49.1 million, or approximately $56.7 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option, based upon the initial public offering price of $10.00
per share.

We will use approximately $19.8 million of the net proceeds to repay amounts
owed to Gaiam for costs to acquire and expand our business. We have no formal
written loan agreement with Gaiam regarding our intercompany payable, and it has
no maturity date. Gaiam historically did not charge us interest on this
intercompany payable. We expect to use approximately $2.1 million of the net
proceeds to pay expenses related to this offering. While we do not currently
have a specific plan for the use of the balance of the net proceeds, our
principal reason for this offering is to provide adequate funds for our working
capital needs and general corporate purposes, which may include future
acquisitions of businesses. We currently have no agreements or commitments to
complete any such transaction and are not involved in any negotiations to do so.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, such as our ability to attract new solar energy customers, market
acceptance of our product offerings, the cost of ongoing upgrades to our product
offerings, our level of expenditures for sales and marketing, our level of
investment in support systems and facilities, the availability of market
expansion opportunities and other market conditions.

Pending any use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
investment-grade, short-term interest-bearing securities."

the 7,825,947 shares of common stock sold by us in the offering (or
approximately $153.3 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option in full). Our estimated net proceeds from the offering represent the
amount we expect to receive after the underwriting discount and our payment of
the other expenses of the offering payable by us. We estimate that the selling
stockholders will receive $174.8 million in proceeds from their sale of
10,924,053 shares of common stock in the offering. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. For purposes of
estimating our net proceeds, we have assumed that the initial public offering
price of the common stock will be $16.00, which is the midpoint of the price
range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. The total number of shares
being offered by us and the selling stockholders is 18,750,000, assuming no
exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option. While the total number of
shares being offered will not change, the number of shares shown as being
offered by us (7,825,947) and the selling stockholders (10,924,053) is an
estimate and may change based on the initial per share offering price. The
estimated number of shares of common stock shown as being offered by us and the
selling stockholders is based upon an assumed offering price of $16.00 per
share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus. The number of shares offered by the selling stockholders represents
all of the common stock into which the preferred stock held by them will convert
upon consummation of the offering. This number of shares is calculated pursuant
to the conversion formula specified in our existing Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation. The number of shares to be sold by the selling
stockholders is determined by dividing $174.8 million (the original issue price
of the preferred stock) by the initial per share offering price. The number of
shares being offered by us is calculated by subtracting the number of shares
offered by the selling stockholders from 18,750,000, the total number of shares
being offered. Our outstanding shares of preferred stock were acquired by the
selling stockholders in 2003 in exchange for notes payable by us to the selling
stockholders that evidenced cash advances they made to us. The aggregate
original issue price of the preferred stock was equal to the principal amount of
the notes plus accrued interest at the time of the exchange.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

†   To pay indebtedness outstanding under our existing credit facility in the
    amount of approximately $38.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had
    approximately $205.3 million principal amount, along with accrued interest,
    outstanding under our credit facility. The weighted average interest rate at 
    December 31, 2007 of our indebtedness under the credit facility was 7.4%. 
    Within our credit facility, the revolving line of credit expires on May 30, 
    2010 and the term loan matures on December 19, 2011.

†   To pay approximately $35.1 million in declared but unpaid dividends to
    existing preferred stockholders. These dividends have been declared but
    unpaid due to the restrictions on payment of dividends contained in our
    credit facility.

†   To declare a dividend payable from the proceeds of this offering to
    preferred stockholders of record immediately prior to the consummation of
    this offering. This dividend will accrue from January 1, 2008 through the
    consummation of this offering at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.5% of the
    original purchase price of our issued and outstanding preferred stock.
    Assuming a closing date of May 12, 2008 for this offering, the amount of
    this dividend would be approximately $3.7 million. Mitchell Rales and
    Steven Rales, and certain entities controlled entirely by them, currently
    own all of our outstanding preferred stock.

†   To reimburse the selling stockholders approximately $11.8 million for the
    underwriting discount on the shares sold by them in this offering, which
    will be recognized as an expense in the quarter in which it is paid.

†   To pay approximately $22.5 million in satisfaction of amounts due, as a
    result of this offering, to participants in our 2001 Employee Appreciation 
    Rights Plan and our 2006 Executive Stock Rights Plan, which are bonus plans
    for certain current and former executive officers. The payments to be made 
    under these bonus plans to our named executive officers, and our other 
    current and former executive officers as a group, are expected to be 
    approximately as follows:

      John A. Young                                              $  3,847,310
      G. Scott Faison                                               1,923,655
      Michael K. Dwyer                                              1,799,741
      Thomas M. O'Brien                                             1,721,546
      Dr. Michael Matros                                            1,304,087
      Other Current and Former Executive Officers (as a group)     11,903,661

      Total                                                      $ 22,500,000

The foregoing amounts do not include additional equity awards that will be
granted to the above persons pursuant to our 2001 Employee Appreciation Rights
Plan. 

Based upon the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus, we do not expect to have any proceeds remaining after application of
the proceeds in the manner described above. In the event we receive additional
proceeds from this offering, we expect to apply such amounts to repay
indebtedness outstanding under our existing credit facility. In the event we
receive less proceeds in this offering than we have estimated, we expect to
reduce the amount used to repay indebtedness.

Affiliates of Merrill Lynch, UBS Securities LLC and Banc of America Securities
LLC, underwriters in this offering, are parties to our credit facility. The
affiliates of Merrill Lynch and Banc of America Securities LLC will receive
approximately $3.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of the proceeds used
to pay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the Term B loan under our
credit facility."

We have analyzed our present operations and anticipated future operations to
determine the most effective strategies to promote future growth. Based upon our
analysis and approved strategic plans, we are seeking expansion opportunities
throughout Georgia and the southeastern United States. There are numerous
opportunities for CCB to expand its financial products and services and to
broaden its banking presence throughout our existing market areas and establish
a presence throughout the rest of Georgia. We expect to use the proceeds from
this offering to pursue offering investment banking services; to strengthen our
mortgage loan operation; to take advantage of community bank acquisition
opportunities within selected states and cities in the southeastern United
States; to purchase treasury stock; and to pay off existing debt. We also plan
to strengthen the capital reserves of the Bank, our primary subsidiary. We note
that we are subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the Federal
Reserve. We plan to maintain capital equal to or higher than eight percent of
risk-weighted assets for both CCB and the Bank. We want to position the Bank so
that it can effectively react to volatility in the economy and maintain capital
ratios well above minimum regulatory levels. We expect that the proceeds from
this offering will help us strengthen our information technology infrastructure
to achieve scanning and imaging capability, to update our computer platforms, to
update our website, and to improve other telecommunication networks.

We will pursue our strategic plans for growth in assets, deposits, and earning
in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations governing our operations.
We intend to immediately deposit the funds from all accepted subscriptions into
the capital accounts of the Bank. No escrow will be utilized in this offering,
and there is no minimum subscription amount for the offering to become

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, FINRA
    filing fee, New York Stock Exchange application fee and legal and accounting
    fees, have been paid from a $500,000 loan we received from Navios Holdings.

(2) These are estimates only. Our actual expenses for some or all of these items
    may differ from the estimates set forth herein.

(3) Represents 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 22,000,000 units
    in this offering ($7,700,000) and 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of
    the 3,300,000 units subject to the underwriters' over-allotment option (an
    additional $1,155,000 for a total of $8,855,000) that will be deposited into 
    the trust account and paid to the underwriters only upon consummation of a
    business combination and then only with respect to those units as to which 
    the component shares have not been converted. If a business combination is 
    not consummated and we are liquidated, such amounts will be distributed 
    among our public  shareholders. In addition, in the event of a business 
    combination, the amount of deferred underwriting compensation payable to the
    underwriters will be paid from the funds held in the trust account.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon
    the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not anticipate
    any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the
    current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent
    they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be
    deducted from our excess working capital.

(5) Assumes our shareholders have not approved the extended period, as described
    in this prospectus. If our shareholders approve the extended period, we could
    incur up to $360,000 ($10,000 per month for up to up to 36 months) for the
    administrative fee payable to Navios Holdings.

(6) The miscellaneous fees and expenses may include, without limitation, finder's
    fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation, potential deposits, down
    payments or funding of a ''no-shop'' provision with respect to a particular
    business combination), trustee's fees, annual transfer fees, and dissolution
    obligations and reserves, if any. The miscellaneous fees and expenses do not,
    however, include the $50,000 per year fee payable to each of our independent
    directors, as such fees are payable only after we have consummated our
    initial business combination. If we consummate our initial business
    combination two years from the date of this prospectus, an aggregate fee of
    $150,000 will be payable to our independent directors.

Proceeds of $218,925,000 (or $250,770,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment
option is fully exercised) from the offering, including the private placement of
7,600,000 of our sponsor warrants to purchase common stock ($7,600,000 in the
aggregate), will be placed in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company as trustee. The amount of proceeds from this offering
also includes $7,700,000 (or $8,855,000, if the underwriters' over-allotment
option is fully exercised) of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions
payable to the underwriter in the offering. Our agreement with the trustee
requires that the trustee will invest and reinvest the proceeds in the trust
account only in United States ''government securities'' within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180
days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Except with respect to
interest income that may be released to us of (i) up to $3,000,000 to fund
working capital requirements and (ii) any additional amounts needed to pay our
income and other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business
combination or a liquidation, or for payments with respect to shares of common
stock converted in connection with the vote to approve a business combination or
an extended period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay sellers of a target business with which we consummate our
initial business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business (excluding taxes and amounts permitted to be
disbursed for expenses as well as the amount held in the trust account
representing deferred underwriting discounts and commissions), may be used to
finance operations of the target business.

We intend to use net proceeds not held in the trust account and up to $3,000,000
of the interest income earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable) for
payment of expenses related to office space and administrative services
($240,000) and legal and accounting fees associated with SEC reporting
obligations ($100,000), legal, accounting and other non-due diligence expenses,
including structuring and negotiating a business combination ($800,000) with the
balance of $935,000 being held in reserve for director and officer liability
insurance premiums and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations. We have also reserved approximately $1,000,000 for reimbursement
of expenses incurred in connection with conducting due diligence reviews of
prospective target businesses. We expect that due diligence of prospective
target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers and directors
and may include engaging market research and valuation firms, as well as other
third party consultants. None of our officers or directors will receive any
compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while performing due
diligence of prospective target businesses. To the extent such out-of-pocket
expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and
interest income, net of income taxes, of up to $3,000,000 that may be released
to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be
reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination. In addition, we
may opt to make a down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection
with structuring and negotiating a business combination. We have not reserved
any specific amounts for such payments or fees, which may have the effect of
reducing the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment
of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on
our behalf. To the extent the size of the offering is increased or decreased,
the amount of interest we may withdraw from the trust account could change
proportionately.

Navios Holdings has loaned us a total of $500,000 for the payment of offering
expenses. This loan will be payable on the earlier of March 31, 2009 or the
completion of this offering. This loan will be repaid out of the proceeds used
to pay the offering expenses.

The net proceeds of this offering that are not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ''government securities,'' defined as any Treasury Bills issued by
the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to
comply with the requirements of such act, in the event that the shareholders do
not approve a plan of dissolution and liquidation and the funds remain in the
trust account for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be
an investment company and, thus, required to comply with such act.

According to the Federal Reserve Statistical Release, referencing historical
interest rate data that appears on the Federal Reserve website, U.S. Treasury
Bills with four-week, three-month and six-month maturities were yielding, in
secondary markets as of June 6, 2008, 1.72%, 1.81% and 1.95%, respectively.
While we cannot assure you the balance of the trust account will be invested to
yield these rates, we believe such rates are representative of those we may
receive on the balance of the trust account. Interest income, net of income
taxes payable on such interest, of up to $3,000,000 on the trust account balance
is releasable to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working
capital requirements. Following completion of this offering, we believe the
funds available to us outside of the trust account, together with interest
income, net of income taxes on such interest, of up to $3,000,000 on the balance
of the trust account to be released to us for working capital requirements, will
be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 36 months, assuming a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

No compensation of any kind, including finder's and consulting fees, will be
paid to any of our directors, officers or any of their affiliates, other than
the payment of $10,000 per month to Navios Holdings in connection with the
general and administrative services arrangement for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the business combination. However, our directors,
officers and Navios Holdings will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
participating in the offering process, identifying target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. In addition, our
independent directors will be entitled to receive $50,000 in cash per year,
accruing pro rata from the respective start of their service on our board of
directors and payable only upon the successful consummation of a business
combination. Since the role of management after a business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination. To the extent that our
capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust fund as well as any other net
proceeds not expended will be used to finance the operations of the target
business.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned there on, net of taxes and amounts permitted to be
disbursed for working capital purposes) only upon (i) liquidation of the trust
account as part of our liquidation on our failure to consummate a business
combination, (ii) if such public shareholder converts their shares of common
stock into cash in connection with a business combination that the public
shareholder voted against and which we actually consummate, or (iii) in
connection with the extended period that the public shareholder voted against
and that is approved. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Upon consummation of any business combination, the underwriters will be entitled
to receive deferred underwriting discounts and commissions held in the trust
account excluding any accrued interest thereon. If we are unable to consummate a
business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,
the underwriters have agreed that the proceeds attributable to deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions will be distributed on a pro-rata basis
among the public shareholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, FINRA
    filing fee, New York Stock Exchange application fee and legal and accounting
    fees, have been paid from a $500,000 loan we received from Navios Holdings.

(2) These are estimates only. Our actual expenses for some or all of these items
    may differ from the estimates set forth herein.

(3) Represents 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 22,000,000 units
    in this offering ($7,700,000) and 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of
    the 3,300,000 units subject to the underwriters' over-allotment option (an
    additional $1,155,000 for a total of $8,855,000) that will be deposited into 
    the trust account and paid to the underwriters only upon consummation of a
    business combination and then only with respect to those units as to which 
    the component shares have not been converted. If a business combination is 
    not consummated and we are liquidated, such amounts will be distributed 
    among our public  shareholders. In addition, in the event of a business 
    combination, the amount of deferred underwriting compensation payable to the
    underwriters will be paid from the funds held in the trust account.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon
    the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not anticipate
    any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the
    current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent
    they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be
    deducted from our excess working capital.

(5) Assumes our shareholders have not approved the extended period, as described
    in this prospectus. If our shareholders approve the extended period, we could
    incur up to $360,000 ($10,000 per month for up to up to 36 months) for the
    administrative fee payable to Navios Holdings.

(6) The miscellaneous fees and expenses may include, without limitation, finder's
    fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation, potential deposits, down
    payments or funding of a ''no-shop'' provision with respect to a particular
    business combination), trustee's fees, annual transfer fees, and dissolution
    obligations and reserves, if any. The miscellaneous fees and expenses do not,
    however, include the $50,000 per year fee payable to each of our independent
    directors, as such fees are payable only after we have consummated our
    initial business combination. If we consummate our initial business
    combination two years from the date of this prospectus, an aggregate fee of
    $150,000 will be payable to our independent directors.

Proceeds of $218,925,000 (or $250,770,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment
option is fully exercised) from the offering, including the private placement of
7,600,000 of our sponsor warrants to purchase common stock ($7,600,000 in the
aggregate), will be placed in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company as trustee. The amount of proceeds from this offering
also includes $7,700,000 (or $8,855,000, if the underwriters' over-allotment
option is fully exercised) of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions
payable to the underwriter in the offering. Our agreement with the trustee
requires that the trustee will invest and reinvest the proceeds in the trust
account only in United States ''government securities'' within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180
days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Except with respect to
interest income that may be released to us of (i) up to $3,000,000 to fund
working capital requirements and (ii) any additional amounts needed to pay our
income and other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business
combination or a liquidation, or for payments with respect to shares of common
stock converted in connection with the vote to approve a business combination or
an extended period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay sellers of a target business with which we consummate our
initial business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business (excluding taxes and amounts permitted to be
disbursed for expenses as well as the amount held in the trust account
representing deferred underwriting discounts and commissions), may be used to
finance operations of the target business.

We intend to use net proceeds not held in the trust account and up to $3,000,000
of the interest income earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable) for
payment of expenses related to office space and administrative services
($240,000) and legal and accounting fees associated with SEC reporting
obligations ($100,000), legal, accounting and other non-due diligence expenses,
including structuring and negotiating a business combination ($800,000) with the
balance of $935,000 being held in reserve for director and officer liability
insurance premiums and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations. We have also reserved approximately $1,000,000 for reimbursement
of expenses incurred in connection with conducting due diligence reviews of
prospective target businesses. We expect that due diligence of prospective
target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers and directors
and may include engaging market research and valuation firms, as well as other
third party consultants. None of our officers or directors will receive any
compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while performing due
diligence of prospective target businesses. To the extent such out-of-pocket
expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and
interest income, net of income taxes, of up to $3,000,000 that may be released
to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be
reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination. In addition, we
may opt to make a down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection
with structuring and negotiating a business combination. We have not reserved
any specific amounts for such payments or fees, which may have the effect of
reducing the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment
of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on
our behalf. To the extent the size of the offering is increased or decreased,
the amount of interest we may withdraw from the trust account could change
proportionately.

Navios Holdings has loaned us a total of $500,000 for the payment of offering
expenses. This loan will be payable on the earlier of March 31, 2009 or the
completion of this offering. This loan will be repaid out of the proceeds used
to pay the offering expenses.

The net proceeds of this offering that are not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ''government securities,'' defined as any Treasury Bills issued by
the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to
comply with the requirements of such act, in the event that the shareholders do
not approve a plan of dissolution and liquidation and the funds remain in the
trust account for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be
an investment company and, thus, required to comply with such act.

According to the Federal Reserve Statistical Release, referencing historical
interest rate data that appears on the Federal Reserve website, U.S. Treasury
Bills with four-week, three-month and six-month maturities were yielding, in
secondary markets as of June 6, 2008, 1.72%, 1.81% and 1.95%, respectively.
While we cannot assure you the balance of the trust account will be invested to
yield these rates, we believe such rates are representative of those we may
receive on the balance of the trust account. Interest income, net of income
taxes payable on such interest, of up to $3,000,000 on the trust account balance
is releasable to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working
capital requirements. Following completion of this offering, we believe the
funds available to us outside of the trust account, together with interest
income, net of income taxes on such interest, of up to $3,000,000 on the balance
of the trust account to be released to us for working capital requirements, will
be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 36 months, assuming a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

No compensation of any kind, including finder's and consulting fees, will be
paid to any of our directors, officers or any of their affiliates, other than
the payment of $10,000 per month to Navios Holdings in connection with the
general and administrative services arrangement for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the business combination. However, our directors,
officers and Navios Holdings will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
participating in the offering process, identifying target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. In addition, our
independent directors will be entitled to receive $50,000 in cash per year,
accruing pro rata from the respective start of their service on our board of
directors and payable only upon the successful consummation of a business
combination. Since the role of management after a business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination. To the extent that our
capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust fund as well as any other net
proceeds not expended will be used to finance the operations of the target
business.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned there on, net of taxes and amounts permitted to be
disbursed for working capital purposes) only upon (i) liquidation of the trust
account as part of our liquidation on our failure to consummate a business
combination, (ii) if such public shareholder converts their shares of common
stock into cash in connection with a business combination that the public
shareholder voted against and which we actually consummate, or (iii) in
connection with the extended period that the public shareholder voted against
and that is approved. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Upon consummation of any business combination, the underwriters will be entitled
to receive deferred underwriting discounts and commissions held in the trust
account excluding any accrued interest thereon. If we are unable to consummate a
business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,
the underwriters have agreed that the proceeds attributable to deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions will be distributed on a pro-rata basis
among the public shareholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

(1)º The funds held in the vessel acquisition account currently secure our
     senior secured notes and will be released at the closing of this offering
     in connection with the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture
     governing our senior secured notes. On May 28, 2008 we deposited
     $52.5 million into the vessel acquisition account for our senior secured
     notes. On May 29, 2008, we made a quarterly interest payment on the notes
     with $10.1 million from the vessel acquisition account. See ""Description of
     Certain Indebtedness—Senior Secured Notes—Excess Cash Flow Offer"".

(2) º Reflects the issuance of 8,333,333 shares at $15.00 per share, less the
     underwriters' discount and commissions, and fees and expenses payable by
     us.

(3)º On May 23, 2008, we entered into a facility agreement for a new $170.0 
     million secured term loan facility. We will draw $170.0 million on this 
     facility at the closing of this offering and will pay estimated fees and 
     expenses of $1.3 million. See ""Description of Certain Indebtedness—New
     Secured Term Loan Facility"".

(4)º Reflects the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and applicable
     prepayment premiums in connection with the satisfaction and discharge of
     the indenture governing the senior secured notes and the consequent
     redemption of all outstanding notes. As of March 31, 2008, we had
     $185.0 million in principal outstanding, bearing interest at an annual rate
     of 11%. Up to 35% of these senior secured notes are callable prior to
     December 1, 2009 with the net proceeds of this offering at a redemption
     price of 112.75% of the accreted value of such notes, plus accrued and
     unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The senior secured notes are
     also callable prior to December 1, 2009 at a redemption price of 100% of
     the accreted value thereof plus the applicable premium as of, and accrued
     and unpaid interest to, the date of redemption.

(5) º As of March 31, 2008, we had $75.9 million in principal outstanding under
     our senior secured bridge facility which we entered into with affiliates of
     Goldman, Sachs & Co., one of the underwriters to this offering. We used
     proceeds therefrom to fund the first installment due on six new-build
     ice-class Panamax vessels for which we entered into a purchase contract in
     November 2007. Were it not repaid at the closing of this offering, the
     senior secured bridge facility would mature in November 2008. From
     execution to (and including) March 30, 2008, it has borne interest at LIBOR
     plus a margin of 6.5% per annum; from (and including) April 1, 2008, to
     (and including) April 30, 2008, it has borne interest at LIBOR plus a

     including) May 31, 2008, it has borne interest at LIBOR plus a margin of
     10.00% per annum; and from (and including) June 1, 2008 to June 30, 2008 
     it is expected to bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 10.50% per annum.

(6) º As of March 31, 2008, we had $30.0 million in principal outstanding under
     our secured bridge facility which we entered into with Lloyds TSB Bank Plc.
     Proceeds from the secured bridge facility were used to fund the acquisition
     of two additional Handysize ice-class bulk carriers delivered in February
     2008. Were it not repaid at the closing of this offering, this secured
     bridge facility would mature in November 2008. To date, it has borne
     interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.0% per annum."
"RHI ENTERTAINMENT, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/rhi-entertainment-inc-756827-56116,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/rhi-entertainment-inc-756827-56116,424B1,6/19/2008,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=6003727,"We will receive net proceeds of approximately $175.8 million from the sale of
13,500,000 common shares at the initial public offering price of $14.00 per
share after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately
$13.2 million. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
then the net proceeds will be approximately $202.1 million after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions.

We will contribute the net proceeds from this offering (including any net
proceeds from the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option), to
Holdings II in exchange for newly issued common membership units of Holdings II.
Holdings II and its subsidiaries will then use the net proceeds received from
us, together with the net proceeds from approximately $140.7 million of
borrowings under RHI LLC’s new $55.0 million senior second lien credit facility
and RHI LLC’s revolving credit facility, as follows:

• approximately $260.0 million will be used to repay RHI LLC’s existing senior 
  second lien credit facility in full;                      

• approximately $35.7 million will be used to fund a distribution to KRH 
  intended to return capital contributions by KRH used for the funding of 
  capitalized film production costs incurred prior to the reorganization which 
  KRH will use to repay its unsecured term loan facility, including prepayment 
  premiums of $5.7 million;                                 

• approximately $20.8 million will be used to pay fees and expenses, net of 
  reimbursements, in connection with the reorganization and offering 
  transactions and the concurrent financing transactions, including $6.0 million
  to Kelso in exchange for the termination of our fee obligations under our 
  existing financial advisory agreement and the payment of a 1% premium in 
  connection with the repayment of RHI LLC’s second lien credit facility in 
  full; and                         
    
• any remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may
  include the repayment of borrowings under RHI LLC’s revolving credit facility.                    

On April 13, 2007, RHI LLC amended its first lien credit agreement and its
existing second lien credit agreement to effect a refinancing of its existing
credit facilities. The existing senior second lien credit facility is now
comprised of a seven-year $260.0 million term loan, which matures on
April 13, 2014. The net proceeds from the existing senior second lien credit
facility were used to repay a portion of the existing $599.0 million of debt
outstanding and accrued interest as of April 13, 2007, $650,000 of prepayment
fees and approximately $7.3 million of bank and professional fees associated
with the amendments.

Interest on borrowings under the existing senior second lien credit facility
accrues at a per annum rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option,
either: (a) a base rate equal to the higher of (1) the prime rate of the
administrative agent and (2) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1%; or (b) a LIBOR
rate as adjusted for certain associated costs. The applicable margin for
borrowings under RHI LLC’s existing senior second lien credit facility is 3%
with respect to all base rate borrowings and 4% with respect to all LIBOR
borrowings. RHI LLC’s existing senior second lien facility accrued interest at
9% per annum as of December 31, 2007.

Any prepayment of principal under RHI LLC’s existing senior second lien credit
facility made prior to April 13, 2009 will require a 1% premium on the loans
repaid. All prepayments require payment of customary ‘‘breakage’’ costs with
respect to LIBOR loans.

Interest on borrowings under the first lien credit facilities accrues at a per
annum rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either: (a) a base
rate equal to the higher of (1) the prime rate of the administrative agent and
(2) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1%; or (b) a LIBOR rate as adjusted for
certain associated costs. The applicable margin for borrowings is 0.50% with
respect to all base rate borrowings and 1.50% with respect to all LIBOR
borrowings. All prepayments require payment of customary ‘‘breakage’’ costs with
respect to LIBOR loans.

On May 8, 2008, RHI Entertainment Holdings, LLC, which will change its name to
KRH Investments LLC immediately prior to the completion of the offering, entered
into a $30.0 million, 27-month senior unsecured term loan facility, which 
matures on August 8, 2010. After paying fees and related expenses, RHI 
Entertainment Holdings, LLC contributed all of the net proceeds to RHI LLC as 
an additional investment in the common equity interests of RHI LLC, which used 
the investment for additional working capital. Interest on borrowings under the 
unsecured term loan facility accrue interest at a rate of 19% per annum through 
the first anniversary of the facility, which increases by an additional 1% per 
annum at commencement of each of the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth 
quarters. Interest is payable in cash, except that the borrower has the option, 
so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing, to elect to pay 
in kind the portion of interest on the loans in excess of 19%, if any. If the 
borrower defaults in the payment of principal or interest, or upon an event of 
default related to ERISA matters, the lenders will have the option to require 
the borrower to pay additional interest on the loans from the date of 
non-payment to the date of cure at a per annum rate equal to 2%. We expect KRH 
to repay all amounts under the unsecured term loan facility with the proceeds 
from a distribution from us funded by the proceeds from this offering and 
intended to return capital contributions by KRH used for the funding of 
capitalized film production costs incurred prior to the reorganization. The 
unsecured term loan facility is subject to a prepayment premium in connection 
with any prepayment prior to May 8, 2009 equal to the amount by which the 
aggregate amount of interest that otherwise would have been payable on the 
prepaid loans during the period from the closing date to the first anniversary 
of the facility exceeds the amount of interest actually paid on such loans 
during the period from the closing date to and including the date of prepayment. 
The prepayment penalty is $5.7 million, which will be paid with a portion of the
proceeds from this offering.

Because affiliates of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. are lenders under the KRH
unsecured term loan facility and RHI LLC’s existing senior second credit
facility, affiliates of such underwriter will receive a portion of the proceeds
of this offering."
