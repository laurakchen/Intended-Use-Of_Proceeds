stock in this offering will be approximately $34,956,000 after deducting 
estimated offering expenses of $1,500,000 and underwriting discounts and 
commissions. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the 
selling stockholders. 
  
We currently intend to use approximately $20,000,000 to $30,000,000 of our net 
proceeds from this offering for capital expenditures intended to improve 
operating efficiencies. A portion of the net proceeds may also be used to 
acquire products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our 
current and future business and product lines. We have no current agreements or
commitments for material acquisitions of any businesses, products or 
technologies. We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working 
capital and general corporate purposes. We will have broad discretion in the 
way we use the net proceeds. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, 
we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade 
securities. 
  
The primary purposes of this offering are to raise additional capital, create 
a U.S. public market for our common stock, allow us easier and quicker access 
to the U.S. public markets should we need more capital in the future, increase 
the profile and prestige of our company with existing and possible future 
customers, vendors and strategic partners and make our stock more valuable and 
attractive to our employees and potential employees for compensation purposes."
PENNYMAC MORTGAGE INVESTMENT TRUST,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/pennymac-mortgage-investment-trust-805446-61123,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/pennymac-mortgage-investment-trust-805446-61123,424B4,7/31/2009,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=6722307,"We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from this offering will be 
approximately $309.2 million (or approximately $352.0 million if the 
underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full), in each case at the 
initial public offering price of $20.00 per share and after deducting 
underwriting discounts paid by us of approximately $8.8 million (or 
approximately $10.1 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment 
option in full), and estimated organization and offering expenses of 
approximately $2.0 million payable by us. 

In connection with the underwritten offering, PCM will pay to the underwriters 
$.20 per share for shares sold in the underwritten offering and the 
underwriters will forego the receipt of payment of $.40 per share, subject to 
the following. We will agree to reimburse $.20 per share to PCM and pay $.40 
per share to the underwriters if during any full four calendar quarter period 
during the 24 full calendar quarters after the date of the completion of this 
offering our Core Earnings for such four-quarter period and before the 
incentive fee equals or exceeds an 8% incentive fee hurdle rate, which is 
calculated as the product of (1) the weighted average of the issue price per 
share of all of our public offerings multiplied by the weighted average number 
of common shares outstanding (including, for the avoidance of doubt, restricted
share units) in the four-quarter period and (2) 8%. We refer to our payment 
obligations under this agreement as our ""conditional payment of the 
underwriting discount."" If such requirement is not satisfied by the end of such
24 calendar quarter period, our obligation to make the conditional payment of 
the underwriting discount will terminate. Assuming that this requirement is 
satisfied and we are required to make the conditional payment of the 
underwriting discount, the aggregate underwriting discount in the underwritten
offering would be $1.20 per underwritten share (resulting in an aggregate 
underwriting discount of approximately $17.6 million (or approximately $20.3 
million if the overallotment option is exercised in full)), after taking into 
account these other payments. 

Concurrently with this offering, we will sell to certain of our executive 
officers, an affiliate of BlackRock, Highfields Capital and PNMAC, in a 
separate private placement, 735,317 common shares (representing 5% of the 
common shares issued in the underwritten offering, excluding common shares 
that may be sold pursuant to the underwriters' overallotment option) at a price
per share equal to the initial public offering price per share in the .
underwritten offering. We will receive proceeds of approximately $14.7 million 
from our concurrent offering. In addition, investors in the PennyMac funds are 
purchasing 1,293,673 common shares in the direct offering, at a price per share
equal to the initial public offering price per share. No underwriting discounts
will be payable in connection with these other offerings. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, our concurrent offering and
the direct offering in accordance with our investment objective and strategies 
pursuant to which we will invest primarily in residential mortgage loans and 
mortgage-related assets. Based on current market conditions, our primary focus 
initially will be on distressed mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, on 
other mortgage-related assets. We anticipate that mortgage loans will initially
comprise a majority of our holdings. As market conditions improve, our focus 
will expand to include other types of assets in our targeted asset classes. At 
all times, we will seek to take advantage of attractive investment 
opportunities that may arise in our targeted asset classes. Prior to the full 
investment of the offering proceeds into our targeted asset classes, we may 
make investments in high grade, short-term securities, such as securities 
guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, securities issued and guaranteed by Freddie Mac or 
Fannie Mae, short-term money market funds, including BlackRock-sponsored money 
market funds, as well as cash equivalents for temporary cash management, 
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. These investments are 
expected to provide a lower rate of return than we will seek from the 
implementation of our investment strategies. Prior to the time we have fully 
invested the net proceeds of this offering, our concurrent offering and the 
direct offering, we may fund quarterly distributions out of such net proceeds. 
To the extent we raise more proceeds in such offerings, we will make more 
investments. To the extent we raise less proceeds in such offerings, we will 
make fewer investments."

to the placement agent and offering expenses payable by us, we expect to
receive net proceeds of approximately $5,940,002 from this offering if the
minimum offering is sold and $8,884,000 if the maximum offering is sold.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows, and we have
ordered the specific uses of proceeds in order of priority. We do not expect
that our priorities for fund allocation would change if the amount we raise 
in this offering exceeds the size of the minimum offering but is less than 
the maximum offering. To the extent we raise an amount between the maximum
offering and the minimum offering, we expect to utilize our offering proceeds
in order of such priority. Although we have tentatively allocated certain 
funds to the possible acquisition of complimentary businesses, as of the date
of this prospectus, we do not have any agreements, arrangements or 
understandings with potential acquisition targets.

short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These 
investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of an investment in our ordinary shares. It is possible 
that we may become a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal
income taxpayers, which could result in negative tax consequences to you."

    could occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand for

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but
will result in a reduction of Territorial Savings Bank’s deposits. The net
proceeds may vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be
more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a
syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not
purchased in the subscription and community offerings.

Territorial Bancorp Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the stock
offering:

     •   to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares of 
         common stock in the stock offering;                                       

     •   to redeem up to $24.0 million of trust preferred securities, depending on 
         how many shares of stock we sell in the offering;                         

     •   to invest in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage          
         obligations and debt securities issued by the United States Government and
         United States Government-sponsored agencies or entities;                  

     •   to finance the acquisition of financial institutions or other financial   
         service companies;                                                        

     •   to pay cash dividends to stockholders;

     •   to repurchase shares of our common stock; and

     •   for other general corporate purposes.

We intend to redeem between $14.0 million and $24.0 million of trust preferred
securities we have issued, depending on how many shares of stock we sell in the
offering. The redemption of the trust preferred securities is effected through
the repayment of subordinated debentures that we have issued to the issuer of
the actual trust preferred securities. Depending on how much of the trust
preferred securities we redeem, we will also incur an expense of up to $522,000
for costs that are being amortized in future periods relating to the issuance of
the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities have maturity
dates and interest rates as follows:

 

                                                    Interest Rate as of 
                 Amount          Maturity Date       December 31, 2008

With the exception of the funding of the loan to the employee stock ownership
plan and the redemption of the trust preferred securities, Territorial Bancorp
Inc. has not quantified its plans for use of the offering proceeds for each of
the foregoing purposes. Initially, we intend to invest a substantial portion of
the net proceeds in short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations
and mortgage-backed securities.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the conversion,
except to fund equity benefit plans other than stock options or except when
extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory approval.

Territorial Savings Bank may use the net proceeds it receives from the Offering:

     •   to expand its banking franchise by establishing or acquiring new branches,
         or by acquiring other financial institutions or other financial services  
         companies. We currently intend to open one new branch office per year over
         the next three years;                                                     

  •   to fund new loans;

  •   to repay short-term borrowings;

  •   to invest in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage       
      obligations, and debt securities issued by the United States Government   
      and United States Government-sponsored agencies or entities; and          

  •   for other general corporate purposes.

Territorial Savings Bank has not quantified its plans for use of the offering
proceeds for each of the foregoing purposes. Our short-term and long-term growth
plans anticipate that, upon completion of the offering, we will experience
growth through increased lending and investment activities and, possibly,
acquisitions. We currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other
banks, thrifts, or other financial services companies. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to consummate any acquisition. We intend to open a new
branch office at a leased facility in Kihei, Hawaii during the first or second
quarter of 2009, but we do not intend to use a material portion of the net
proceeds with respect to this office. We expect that our capital expenditures
will be approximately $600,000 per branch office that we establish.

Initially, the net proceeds we retain will be invested in short-term
investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities."

    could occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand for
    the shares or changes in market conditions following the commencement of the 
    offering.                                                                    

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but
will result in a reduction of Territorial Savings Bank’s deposits. The net
proceeds may vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be
more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a
syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not
purchased in the subscription and community offerings.

Territorial Bancorp Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the stock
offering:

     •   to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares of 
         common stock in the stock offering;                                       

     •   to redeem up to $24.0 million of trust preferred securities, depending on 
         how many shares of stock we sell in the offering;                         

     •   to invest in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage          
         obligations and debt securities issued by the United States Government and
         United States Government-sponsored agencies or entities;                  

     •   to finance the acquisition of financial institutions or other financial   
         service companies;                                                        

     •   to pay cash dividends to stockholders;

     •   to repurchase shares of our common stock; and

     •   for other general corporate purposes.

We intend to redeem between $14.0 million and $24.0 million of trust preferred
securities we have issued, depending on how many shares of stock we sell in the
offering. The redemption of the trust preferred securities is effected through
the repayment of subordinated debentures that we have issued to the issuer of
the actual trust preferred securities. Depending on how much of the trust
preferred securities we redeem, we will also incur an expense of up to $522,000
for costs that are being amortized in future periods relating to the issuance of
the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities have maturity
dates and interest rates as follows:

 

                                                    Interest Rate as of 
                 Amount          Maturity Date       December 31, 2008

With the exception of the funding of the loan to the employee stock ownership
plan and the redemption of the trust preferred securities, Territorial Bancorp
Inc. has not quantified its plans for use of the offering proceeds for each of
the foregoing purposes. Initially, we intend to invest a substantial portion of
the net proceeds in short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations
and mortgage-backed securities.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the conversion,
except to fund equity benefit plans other than stock options or except when
extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory approval.

Territorial Savings Bank may use the net proceeds it receives from the Offering:

     •   to expand its banking franchise by establishing or acquiring new branches,
         or by acquiring other financial institutions or other financial services  
         companies. We currently intend to open one new branch office per year over
         the next three years;                                                     

  •   to fund new loans;

  •   to repay short-term borrowings;

  •   to invest in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage       
      obligations, and debt securities issued by the United States Government   
      and United States Government-sponsored agencies or entities; and          

  •   for other general corporate purposes.

Territorial Savings Bank has not quantified its plans for use of the offering
proceeds for each of the foregoing purposes. Our short-term and long-term growth
plans anticipate that, upon completion of the offering, we will experience
growth through increased lending and investment activities and, possibly,
acquisitions. We currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other
banks, thrifts, or other financial services companies. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to consummate any acquisition. We intend to open a new
branch office at a leased facility in Kihei, Hawaii during the first or second
quarter of 2009, but we do not intend to use a material portion of the net
proceeds with respect to this office. We expect that our capital expenditures
will be approximately $600,000 per branch office that we establish.

Initially, the net proceeds we retain will be invested in short-term
investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities."

approximately $72.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The selling
stockholders will receive approximately $24.8 million from their sale of our 
common stock in this offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and 
commissions. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common
stock by the selling stockholders. Our chief executive officer and chief 
technology officer are selling shares of common stock in this offering. If the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate the net 
proceeds to us will be approximately $83.3 million, and we estimate the net 
proceeds to the selling stockholders will be approximately $28.5 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for working capital 
and other general corporate purposes, including the development of new 
services, sales and marketing activities and capital expenditures. We may also 
use a portion of the net proceeds to us for the acquisition of, or investment 
in, companies, technologies, services or assets that complement our business. 
Other principal purposes for this offering are to: 

• create a public market for our common stock;  
   
• facilitate our future access to the public capital markets;  
   
• provide liquidity for our existing stockholders;  
   
• increase our visibility in our markets;  
   
• improve the effectiveness of our equity compensation plans in attracting 
  and retaining key employees; and  
   
• enhance our ability to acquire or invest in complementary companies, 
  technologies, products or assets.  

We have not yet determined with any certainty the manner in which we will 
allocate these net proceeds. Management will retain broad discretion in the 
allocation and use of the net proceeds to us from this offering. The amounts 
and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors,
including the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and 
technological developments, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business.

Although we may use a portion of our net proceeds for the acquisition of, or 
investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our 
business, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to
enter into any acquisitions or make any investments. We cannot assure you that 
we will make any acquisitions or investments in the future. 

Pending specific use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds to us from this offering in short-term investment 
grade and U.S. government securities."

financial or other information on which we base our decisions regarding the

underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase up to an additional 6,075,000 
shares). We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from selling common 
stock in this offering will be approximately $783.8 million, after deducting 
the initial underwriting discount of $24.2 million payable by us at closing 
and estimated offering expenses of approximately $2.0 million (or, if the 
underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, approximately $901.7 
million, after deducting the initial underwriting discount payable by us at 
closing and estimated offering expenses of approximately $2.0 million). 
Concurrently with the completion of this offering, SPT Investment, LLC will 
acquire 1,000,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement at a price 
per share equal to the price per share in this offering, yielding $20.0 million
of proceeds to us. 
  
All shares sold to certain investors in private funds managed by affiliates of 
Starwood Capital Group will be purchased by the underwriters from us at $19.50 
per share, representing a discount to the underwriters of $.50 per share, all 
of which discount will be payable by us at closing. All of the other shares 
sold in this offering will be sold to the underwriters at $19.20 per share, 
representing an initial discount to the underwriters of $.80 per share. Of 
this initial discount, we will pay the underwriters $.60 per share, and our 
Manager will pay the underwriters $.20 per share, in each case upon the 
closing of this offering. We have agreed to repay our Manager $.20 per share 
and pay the underwriters an additional $.40 per share, in each case with 
respect to all shares sold in this offering (other than any shares sold to 
certain investors in private funds managed by affiliates of Starwood Capital 
Group) if during any full four calendar quarter period during the 24 full 
calendar quarters after the consummation of this offering our Core Earnings 
for any such four-quarter period exceeds the product of (x) the weighted 
average of the issue price per share of all public offerings of our common 
stock, multiplied by the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
(including any restricted stock units, any restricted shares of common stock 
and any other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under our 
equity incentive plans) in such four-quarter period and (y) 8%. If we meet the 
performance hurdle rate described above, we would repay our Manager $7.9 
million in the aggregate (or $9.1 million if the underwriters exercise their 
overallotment option) and pay the underwriters an additional underwriting 
discount equal to $15.7 million in the aggregate (or $18.1 million if the 
underwriters exercise their overallotment in full) assuming that no shares are 
sold to certain investors in any private funds managed by affiliates of 
Starwood Capital Group. In such case, our total net proceeds from this 
offering would be approximately $760.3 million (or, if the underwriters 
exercise their overallotment option in full, approximately $874.5 million), 
after deducting the initial underwriting discount, the additional underwriting 
discount and estimated offering expenses. 
  
We plan to use all the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent 
private placement as described above to acquire our target assets in 
accordance with our objectives and strategies described in this prospectus. 
Based on prevailing market conditions, our current expectation is that our 
initial investment portfolio will consist of between 60% to 70% commercial 
mortgage and mezzanine loans, 10% to 20% commercial real estate corporate 
debt, 10% to 20% MBS (consisting primarily of CMBS and secondarily of RMBS), 
and the balance in our other target assets. However, there is no assurance 
that upon the completion of this offering we will not allocate the proceeds 
from this offering and the concurrent private placement in a different manner 
among our target assets. Our decisions will depend on prevailing market 
conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in 
different interest rate, economic and credit environments. Until appropriate 
assets can be identified, our Manager may invest the net proceeds from this 
offering and the concurrent private placement in interest-bearing short-term 
investments, including Agency RMBS, AAA-rated CMBS and money market accounts, 
that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. These investments 
are expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from 
our target assets. Prior to the time we have fully used the net proceeds of 
this offering and the concurrent private placement to acquire our target 
assets, we may fund our quarterly distributions out of such net proceeds."

of common stock offered hereby will be approximately $75.2 million after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $87.0 
million. 
  
We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering principally for 
acquisitions of product candidates, new products, intellectual property 
rights to products or companies that complement our business. We actively seek 
out acquisitions in the markets in which we have developed our sales 
forces—hospital acute care and gastroenterology. We concentrate our efforts 
on products that are in the late stages of development or that are currently 
marketed. We do not currently have a letter of intent or definitive purchase 
agreement for any potential target. We may undertake one large acquisition, 
utilizing substantially all of the net proceeds from this offering, or we may 
engage in one or more smaller acquisitions. It is also possible that we do not 
identify and complete any acquisitions. Our bank credit agreement requires that
we obtain the consent of the bank prior to making acquisitions unless the 
acquisitions meet certain criteria. 
  
Subject to the foregoing, we currently expect to use our net proceeds from this
offering as follows: 
  
Ø    the majority for potential acquisition of rights to additional products 
     or product candidates, as discussed above;  
   
Ø    approximately $3.1 million for ongoing clinical work, product development
     and other costs related to Caldolor;  
   
Ø    approximately $8.4 million for expected commercial introduction of 
     Caldolor to the U.S. market;  
   
Ø    approximately $6.6 million for expansion of our hospital sales force to a
     total of approximately 77 representatives and managers;  
   
Ø    approximately $4.2 million to pay down our term loan from Bank of America;

Ø    approximately $1.0 million for product development by CET, our 85%-owned 
     subsidiary; and  
   
Ø    the remainder to fund working capital and for general corporate purposes.

The expected uses of net proceeds of this offering represent our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. As of the 
date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the 
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon completion of this 
offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the 
application of the net proceeds, and you will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. 
  
The amounts we actually expend for the above-specified purposes may vary 
depending on a number of factors, including the extent of our success in 
identifying and completing acquisitions, changes in our business strategy, the
amount of our future revenues and expenses and our future cash flow. If our 
future revenues or cash flow are less than we currently anticipate, we may 
need to support our ongoing business operations with net proceeds from this 
offering that we would otherwise use to support acquisitions and other methods
of growth. 
  
Until we use the net proceeds from this offering for the above purposes, we 
intend to invest the funds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
securities as directed by our investment policy. Our goals with respect to the 
investment of these net proceeds are capital preservation and liquidity so 
that such funds are readily available. 
  
We expect to use approximately $4.2 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering to repay our outstanding borrowings under a recently amended term 
loan agreement with Bank of America. Effective July 2009, we amended our debt 
agreement with Bank of America to provide for $18.0 million in term debt and a 
$4.0 million revolving credit facility. 
  
We expect to draw down on our amended debt agreement with Bank of America in 
the third quarter of 2009 in connection with the Option Transaction. We expect 
to use the proceeds from the term debt to pay in part the minimum statutory 
tax withholding requirements of approximately $24.6 million due upon completion
of the Option Transaction. The consideration for that payment will be the 
transfer to us of 1,445,074 shares of our common stock. In connection with the 
Option Transaction, we expect to generate a deferred tax asset of 
approximately $25.5 million to offset future tax liabilities."

from the sale by us of the ordinary shares offered in this offering, after 
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. We will also receive in the aggregate approximately $2
million from selling shareholders who will pay to us the exercise price for 
options exercised by them for the purpose of selling shares in this offering. 
Otherwise, we will not receive any proceeds from the ordinary shares to be
offered by the selling shareholders, although we will pay the expenses, other 
than underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with the sale of those
ordinary shares pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. The selling 
shareholders include members of our senior management and entities affiliated 
with directors of our company. Bali Investments S.àr.l, an entity controlled 
by KKR and Silver Lake, is our controlling shareholder and is a selling 
shareholder in this offering.

As described in more detail below, we currently intend to use the net proceeds 
of this offering for the following purposes and in the following amounts: 

• approximately $53 million will be paid to our equity sponsors (Kohlberg 
  Kravis Roberts & Co., L.P. and Silver Lake Management Company, L.L.C.) in 
  connection with the termination of our advisory agreement pursuant to its 
  terms (with one-half payable to each equity sponsor); and 
 
• approximately $246 million will be used to repay a portion of our long-term 
  indebtedness, which consists of our senior floating rate notes due 2013 (of 
  which, as of May 3, 2009, there was approximately $50 million principal 
  amount outstanding), our 10 1/8 % senior notes due 2013 (of which, as of
  May 3, 2009, there was approximately $403 million principal amount 
  outstanding), and our 11 7/8 % senior subordinated notes due 2015 (of which, 
  as of May 3, 2009, there was approximately $247 million principal amount 
  outstanding), including approximately $10 million of estimated prepayment 
  premiums. The selection of which series of notes, the amounts to be repaid 
  within a particular series, the timing of repayment and the particular method
  by which we effect repayment, which could include redemption calls, open 
  market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or tender offers, or
  some combination thereof, have not yet been determined and will depend, 
  among other things, on market conditions. 

Interest on our senior floating rate notes due 2013 is calculated at a rate of
three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 5.5%. As of May 3, 
2009, the interest rate on such notes was 6.76%. 

KKR Capital Markets LLC, one of the underwriters for this offering, is an
affiliate of: 

• Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts & Co., L.P., one of our equity sponsors, which 
  will receive approximately $28 million of the proceeds from this offering in 
  connection with the termination of our advisory agreement pursuant to its 
  terms, which includes an amount equal to 0.5% of the proceeds to us from this
  offering as specified in the Advisory Agreement, and 
 
• an investment advisor that manages certain funds and accounts, which hold $10
  million principal amount of our senior floating rate notes, $20 million 
  principal amount of our senior notes and $52 million principal amount of our
  senior subordinated notes, some or all of which may be retired with a portion
  of the net proceeds from this offering.

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. 
We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us will be approximately $43.4 million, based on the initial offering price 
of $12.00 per ADS, or $47.4 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full, in each case after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us. We will 
not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling 
shareholder. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes, including expanding our direct and indirect sales channels, funding
our working capital, research and development, performance based acquisition 
related payments, and possible acquisitions of, and strategic investments in,
complementary businesses, products and technologies. We periodically engage in
preliminary discussions with respect to potential acquisitions. 

Except as disclosed below, we are not currently a party to any binding 
agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisitions for which we intend 
to use proceeds from this offering. 

On February 9, 2009, we signed a letter of intent to acquire WKD Solutions 
Ltd., a provider of supply chain event management and business activity 
monitoring solutions that helps enterprises improve their supply chain 
visibility and support their governance, risk and compliance requirements, for 
£1.0 million (approximately $1.5 million using the exchange rate applicable on
February 9, 2009). This acquisition is subject to several standard closing 
conditions including receipt of approval from our board of directors and the 
satisfactory completion of due diligence. In the event that this acquisition 
is consummated, we anticipate that we will utilize an aggregate of 
approximately $1.5 million of the proceeds of this offering to acquire WKD 
Solutions Ltd. 

We believe that our cash flow will fund estimated future working capital 
expenditures, planned capital expenditures and small acquisitions. However, 
proceeds from this offering will further enable us to make more significant 
acquisitions than those that could be funded solely from our cash flow. The 
proceeds of this offering may also be used to accelerate certain working 
capital projects such as the integration of our operating subsidiaries into 
a common general ledger system and accelerate the expansion of office space to
accommodate a growing employee base. 

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and 
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans 
and business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility
and discretion in applying the net proceeds. The occurrence of unforeseen 
events or changed business conditions could result in the application of the 
net proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described above. 
Pending our use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to hold the 
net proceeds in short-term bank deposits or invest them in interest-bearing, 
investment grade securities."

$278.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ option to 
purchase additional shares in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate 
that our net proceeds will be approximately $321.0 million. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 
  
• To repay at least $139.4 million of term loans outstanding under our senior 
  secured credit facility, and any related prepayment costs.  
   
• To make payments under the Long Term Cash Incentive Plan in the amount of 
  approximately $18.0 million, which will be recognized as an expense in the 
  quarter in which the offering occurs. We expect approximately $4.5 million 
  will be paid to Rocco A. Ortenzio, approximately $6.3 million will be paid 
  to Robert A. Ortenzio, approximately $2.7 million will be paid to Patricia A.
  Rice, approximately $1.3 million will be paid to Martin F. Jackson,

  $0.5 million will be paid to David W. Cross, approximately $0.9 million will
  be paid to James J. Talalai and approximately $0.9 million will be paid to

Any remaining net proceeds will be used for repayment or repurchase of 
indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility, Select’s 7 5/8% 
senior subordinated notes, our senior floating rate notes and/or our 10% 
senior subordinated notes or for general corporate purposes. 
  
The average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 of our 
indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility was 6.1%. Our current 
revolving credit facility will terminate on February 24, 2011. Our Tranche B 
term loans mature on February 24, 2012 and our Tranche B-1 term loans mature 
on August 22, 2014. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P. Morgan 
Securities Inc., Wachovia Bank, National Association, an affiliate of Wells 
Fargo Securities, LLC, and Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, an affiliate of
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated are lenders under our 
senior secured credit facility and therefore affiliates of these underwriters 
will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and an affiliate 
of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC will receive more than 5% of the net proceeds 
from the offering based on the application of the net proceeds from this 
offering as set forth under “Capitalization”. Based on term and revolving 
loans held as of August 31, 2009 and the application of the net proceeds from 
this offering as set forth under “Capitalization,” the amounts to be repaid to 
affiliates of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & 
Smith Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC with the proceeds from this 
offering will be approximately $11.0 million, $10.9 million and $22.3 million, 
respectively. In addition, from time to time, certain of the underwriters and 
their affiliates may effect transactions for their own account or the account 
of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or 
short positions in our debt or equity securities or loans, and may do so in 
the future.
  
Select’s 7 5/8% senior subordinated notes mature on February 1, 2015 and 
bear interest at a stated rate of 7 5/8%. Our senior floating rate notes 
mature on September 15, 2015 and bear interest at a rate per annum, reset 
semi-annually, equal to the 6-month LIBOR plus 5.75%. The variable interest 
rate of our senior floating rate notes was 7.7% at June 30, 2009. Our 10% 
senior subordinated notes mature on December 15, 2015 and bear interest at a 
rate of 10% per annum, except that if any interest payment is not paid in 
cash, such unpaid amount will be multiplied by 1.2 and added to the 
outstanding principal amount of the notes (with the result that such unpaid 
interest will have accrued at an effective rate of 12% instead of 10%)."

approximately $342.9 million and the net proceeds to the selling stockholders 
will be $8.5 million, based on the initial public offering price of $13.50 per 
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses. The selling stockholders consist of our chief executive 
officer and all of our founders, including our chief technology officer and 
vice president of business development. 

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for capital 
expenditures, including capital expenditures related to the expansion of our 
manufacturing capacity in Michigan, working capital and other general 
corporate purposes. The portion of the proceeds of this offering we use to 
expand our manufacturing capacity and the timing of the use thereof are 
subject to the pace at which we expand our manufacturing capacity. The pace at 
which we expand our manufacturing capacity depends on actual and anticipated 
future demand for our products. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds 
to us to expand our business through acquisitions of other companies, assets 
or technologies and to fund joint ventures with development partners. At this 
time we do not have any commitment to any specific acquisitions or to fund 
joint ventures. In addition, we may choose to use a part of the net proceeds 
from this offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of
credit or term loan from time to time. As of June 30, 2009, we had $8.0 
million outstanding under this revolving line of credit. The interest rate on 
the revolving line of credit is prime, which was 3.25% at June 30, 2009. This 
revolving line of credit will expire in September 2010. As of June 30, 2009, 
we had $13.7 million outstanding under our term loan. Amounts borrowed under 
the term loan are repayable over a 36-month period beginning six months after 
the date of borrowing. The interest rate on the term loan is prime plus 0.75%. 

Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public 
market for our common stock, increase our visibility in the marketplace, and 
provide liquidity to existing stockholders. A public market for our common 
stock will facilitate future access to public equity markets and enhance our 
ability to use our common stock as a means of attracting and retaining key 
employees and as consideration for acquisitions. Depending on the future 
demand for our products and the pace at which we expand our manufacturing 
capacity, we may seek to raise additional capital to fund our manufacturing 
expansion. 

We will have broad discretion in the way that we use the net proceeds of this 
offering. The amounts that we actually spend for the purposes described above 
may vary significantly and will depend, in part, on the timing and amount of 
our future revenue, our future expenses and any potential acquisitions that we
may pursue. Pending the uses of the net proceeds of this offering as described
above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in 
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities including corporate, financial 
institution, federal agency and U.S. government obligations."

common stock and the concurrent private placement, after deducting our 
estimated offering and organizational expenses, will be approximately 
$198 million (based on the offering price of $20.00 per share set forth on the 
cover of this prospectus). We estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately $228 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option in full. 

The underwriters will not be entitled to receive any payment from us at 
closing. All of the shares sold in this offering will be sold to the 
underwriters at $20.00 per share. Our Manager will pay the underwriters 
$0.80 per share upon the closing of this offering. We have agreed to repay our

herein) for any such four-quarter period exceeds the product of (x) the public 
offering price per share as shown on the cover page of this prospectus

including any shares that may be sold upon exercise of the underwriters’ 
overallotment option, and in the concurrent private placement and (y) 8%. If 
we meet the performance hurdle rate described above, we would repay our 
Manager $8 million in the aggregate (or $9.2 million if the underwriters 
exercise their overallotment option in full) and pay the underwriters an 
additional underwriting discount equal to $2 million in the aggregate (or 
$2.3 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment in full). In 
such case, our total net proceeds from this offering would be approximately 
$188 million (or, if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in 
full, approximately $216.5 million), after deducting the initial underwriting 
discount, the additional underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses. 

Concurrently with the closing of this offering, we will sell to Apollo and 
certain of its affiliates in a separate private placement, at the initial 
public offering price per share, shares of our common stock representing an 
aggregate investment equal to 5% of the gross proceeds raised in this 
offering, excluding the underwriters’ overallotment option, up to $10 million. 
No underwriting discount is payable in connection with the sale of shares to 
Apollo and certain of its affiliates. 

We intend to contribute the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent 
private placement to our subsidiaries, which in turn will use such net 
proceeds to acquire our target assets in accordance with our objectives and 
strategies described in this prospectus. Initially, we expect that our focus 
will be on originating and acquiring senior performing commercial real estate 
mortgage loans, commercial real estate corporate debt and loans and purchasing 
CMBS, subject to our investment guidelines and to the extent consistent with 
maintaining our REIT qualification. Based upon current market conditions and 
our current expectations, we anticipate our initial portfolio of target assets 
will be comprised of between 30% to 50% of whole mortgage loans, 20% to 40% of 
newly issued CMBS, 0 to 20% of legacy CMBS and 10% to 30% of other non-core 
assets described above. The allocation of our capital among our target assets
will depend on prevailing market conditions at the time we invest and may 
change over time in response to different prevailing market conditions, 
including with respect to interest rates and general economic and credit 
market conditions. There is no assurance that upon the completion of this 
offering we will not allocate the proceeds from this offering and the 
concurrent private placement in a different manner among our target assets. In 
addition, in the future we may invest in assets other than our target assets, 
in each case subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes and our exemption from registration under the 1940 
Act. Until appropriate assets can be identified, our Manager may invest the 
net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement in 
interest-bearing short-term investments, including money market accounts, that 
are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. These investments are 
expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from our 
target assets. We currently expect to use substantially all of the net 
proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement within four 
to six months from the closing of this offering and the concurrent private 
placement."

Younes in order to enable our parent and our Principals to liquidate a portion 
of their respective shareholdings in us. We will not retain any of the net 
proceeds. As a result, the per share repurchase price of the 22.6 million 
shares of Class C common stock held by our parent and the 1.2 million shares 
of Class A common stock held by each of our Principals will equal the offering 
price of our Class A common stock in this offering, less the underwriting

of $20.00 per share. Concurrently with the completion of this offering, we will
complete a private placement in which we will sell shares of our common stock to
certain of our executive officers and certain officers of Colony Capital and its
affiliates at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price per
share. We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from this offering will
be approximately $245.3 million, after deducting the initial underwriting
discounts and commissions of $2.5 million payable by us at closing and estimated
offering expenses of approximately $2.2 million (or, if the underwriters
exercise their overallotment option in full, approximately $282.4 million, after
deducting the initial underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.875 million
payable by us at closing and estimated offering expenses of approximately
$2.2 million). The net proceeds we will receive in the concurrent private
placement of our common stock will be $5.0 million.

All of the shares sold in this offering will be sold to the underwriters at
$19.40 per share, representing initial discounts and commissions to the
underwriters of $.60 per share. Of these initial discounts and commissions, we
will pay the underwriters $.20 per share, and our Manager will pay the
underwriters $.40 per share, in each case upon the closing of this offering. We
have agreed to reimburse our Manager $.40 per share and pay the underwriters an
additional $.40 per share, in each case with respect to all shares sold in this
offering if during any full four calendar quarter period during the 24 full
calendar quarters after the consummation of this offering our Core Earnings (as
described herein) for any such four-quarter period exceeds the product of
(1) the weighted average of the issue price per share of common stock in all of
our offerings multiplied by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding (including any restricted shares of common stock and any other
shares of common stock underlying awards granted under our equity incentive
plans, if any) in such four-quarter period and (2) 8%. If we meet the
performance hurdle described above, we would reimburse our Manager $5.0 million
(based on the initial public offering price) in the aggregate (or approximately
$5.8 million (based on the initial public offering price) if the underwriters
exercise their overallotment option) and pay the underwriters an additional
underwriting discount equal to $5.0 million in the aggregate (or approximately
$5.8 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment in full). In such
case, after giving effect to the value of the shares of our common stock paid to
our Manager as reimbursement of the Manager’s partial payment of the
underwriting discounts and commissions (based upon the initial public offering
price per share), our total net proceeds from this offering would be
approximately $235.3 million (or, if the underwriters exercise their
overallotment option in full, approximately $270.9 million), after deducting the
initial underwriting discounts and commissions, the additional underwriting
discounts and commissions, and estimated offering expenses.

Any such reimbursement of our Manager by us will be paid in the form of 250,000
shares (287,500 shares if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option
in full) of our common stock (the reimbursement amount divided by the public
offering price per share of our common stock in this offering), subject to
adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar
events, so long as the ownership of such additional number of shares by our
Manager would not result in a violation of the stock ownership limits set forth
in our charter, after giving effect to any waivers from such limit that our
board of directors may grant to our Manager or its affiliates in the future. To
the extent that reimbursement of our Manager’s partial payment of the initial
underwriting discounts and commissions in shares of our common stock would
result in a violation of the stock ownership limits set forth in our charter
(taking into account any applicable waiver, if any), all or a portion of the
reimbursement of our Manager will be payable in cash to the extent necessary to
avoid such violation.

We plan to use substantially all the net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement as described above to acquire our target assets in
a manner consistent with our investment strategies and investment guidelines
described in this prospectus. We initially intend to focus primarily on 
acquiring commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related 
debt investments. We also may acquire other real estate and real estate-related 
debt assets. Based upon existing market conditions, we currently expect our 
initial portfolio of our target assets will be comprised of between 60% to 80% 
of whole mortgage loans (which we do not expect to be rated), with a focus on 
secondary acquisitions of loans at discounts from financial institutions and 
FDIC liquidations of failed financial institutions, 10% to 20% of CMBS (which 
we expect to have ratings ranging from “AAA” to non-investment grade, with the 
majority of our investments in CMBS to be currently or originally rated “AAA”) 
and 10% to 20% of other target assets, including DIP loans (which we do
not expect to be rated). There can be no assurance that our initial portfolio of
our target assets will be allocated in such manner, or that our portfolio of our
target assets will not change over time. The allocation of our capital among our
target assets will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over
time in response to different prevailing market conditions, including with
respect to interest rates and general economic and credit market conditions. In
addition, we also may use the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement to invest in assets other than our target assets, subject to
maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. Until appropriate
investments can be identified, our Manager may invest the net proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement in interest-bearing short-term
investments, including U.S. treasury securities or a money market account, that
are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT and maintain our
exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. These investments are expected
to provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from our target
assets. We currently expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from

that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $47.7 million, 
based on the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share less 
underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses. 

If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate 
that we will receive additional net proceeds of approximately $7.4 million. We 
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by any selling 
stockholder. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

   •  approximately $7.6 million to repay existing indebtedness owed under our 
      credit facility, which indebtedness bears interest at a rate equal to 
      1-month LIBOR plus 2.75% and matures on July 30, 2010; 

   •  approximately $1 million to repay existing indebtedness owed to one of 
      our directors. 

   •  approximately $20 million to fund capital expenditures such as purchasing
      fulfillment and manufacturing equipment and retrofitting and expanding 
      our manufacturing and distribution facilities; and 
 
   •  the balance for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 
The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts 
and purposes for which we allocate the net proceeds from this offering may vary
significantly depending upon a number of factors, including, without 
limitation, the actual cost of capital expenditures, the amount of financing, 
if any, obtained for the expansion of our existing facilities or acquisition 
of new facilities, our future sales, our cash flows from operations and the 
growth of our business. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the 
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering and could utilize the 
proceeds in ways that do not necessarily improve our results of operations or 
enhance the value of our common stock. Pending the uses described above, we

CREXUS INVESTMENT CORP.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/crexus-investment-corp-807421-61403,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/crexus-investment-corp-807421-61403,424B5,9/17/2009,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=6804210,"We estimate that our net proceeds from the initial public offering of our 
shares of common stock, after deducting the initial underwriting discount of 
$8.0 million payable by us at closing and estimated offering and 
organizational expenses of approximately $1.0 million, will be approximately 
$191.0 million (excluding $2.0 million of additional deferred underwriting
discount payable by us as described below). We estimate that our net proceeds,
after deducting the initial underwriting discount of $9.2 million payable by 
us at closing and estimated offering and organizational expenses of
approximately $1.0 million, will be approximately $219.8 million if the
underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full (excluding $2.3 
million of additional deferred underwriting discount payable by us as
described below). 

The underwriters will be entitled to receive a discount of $0.60 per share 
from us at closing for the shares sold in this offering. In addition, the 
underwriters will forego the receipt of payment of $0.15 per share, subject 
to the following. We will agree to pay the $0.15 per share to the underwriters
if during any full four calendar quarter period during the 24 full calendar
quarters after the consummation of this offering our Core Earnings 
(as described herein) for any such four-quarter period exceeds an 8% 
performance hurdle rate (as described herein). If this requirement is 
satisfied, the aggregate underwriting discount paid by us, based on $15.00
per share, would be $0.75 per share (or 5% of the public offering price). 
Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income (loss)
excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, depreciation and amortization
(to the extent that we foreclose on any properties underlying our target 
assets), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded for the
period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive
income or loss, or in net income. The amount will be adjusted to exclude 
one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges
after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after
approval by a majority of our independent directors. The performance hurdle
rate will be met if during any full four calendar quarter period during the
24 full calendar quarters after the consummation of this offering our Core 
Earnings for any such four-quarter period exceeds the product of (x) the 
weighted average of the issue price per share of all public offerings of our 
common stock, multiplied by the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
(including any restricted stock units, any restricted shares of common stock
and any other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under our
equity incentive plans) in such four-quarter period and (y) 8%. 

Concurrent with this offering, we also expect to sell, in a separate private
placement, 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock after giving effect 
to the shares issued in this offering and the concurrent private placement, 
excluding shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of their 
overallotment option and shares of our common stock approved to be granted to 
our independent directors, to Annaly at a price per share equal to the initial
public offering price. No underwriting discount is payable in connection with
the sale of shares to Annaly. We plan to deploy the net proceeds of this 
offering and the concurrent private placement of shares to Annaly in 
accordance with our objectives and the strategies described in this
prospectus. 

We intend to acquire CMBS, commercial real estate loans, commercial real 
estate-related securities and various other commercial real estate asset 
classes and Agency RMBS. Initially, we expect to focus our activities on 
acquiring CMBS that are, or were previously, primarily AAA-rated, and 
commercial real estate loans through our MOSAs with third parties as well as 
our own direct relationships with commercial mortgage brokers and borrowers.
As the diligence and acquisition lead times for commercial real estate loans 
are longer than for CMBS and Agency RMBS, we expect at the outset that a
majority of our portfolio will consist of CMBS, Agency RMBS and cash and cash
equivalents, subject to maintaining our REIT qualification and our 1940 Act 
exemption. However, we expect our portfolio to become weighted toward 
commercial real estate loans over the next 12 months. Based on prevailing 
market conditions, our current expectation is that, over the next 12 months,
our portfolio will consist of between 60% to 80% commercial mortgage loans,
20% to 40% CMBS, up to 5% other commercial real estate-related assets and up 
to 5% Agency RMBS. Our allocation decisions, including our initial allocation
decisions, will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over 
time in response to opportunities available in different interest rate, 
economic and credit environments. Furthermore, there is no assurance upon the
completion of this offering that we will not allocate the proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement in a different manner among our
targeted assets from time to time. We may change our strategy and policies
without a vote of our stockholders. Until appropriate assets can be identified,
our Manager may invest these funds in interest-bearing short-term investments,
including money market accounts, securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, 
securities issued and guaranteed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, as well as cash
equivalents for temporary cash management, that are consistent with our
intention to qualify as a REIT. These investments are expected to provide a 
lower net return than we hope to achieve from deploying the proceeds of this
offering in our targeted assets. We expect to reallocate a portion of the net
proceeds from this offering into a more diversified portfolio of assets within
twelve months, subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities. 
Our Manager intends to conduct due diligence with respect to our asset
acquisitions and suitable opportunities may not be immediately available. 
To the extent we raise more proceeds in this offering, we will make more asset
acquisitions. To the extent we raise less proceeds in this offering, we will
make fewer asset acquisitions."

(1) We intend to enter into a new $50.0 million revolving credit facility at 
    the completion of this offering. 

(2) Addus HealthCare entered into a credit agreement with Freeport Financial 
    LLC, Freeport Loan Fund LLC and certain other parties on September 19, 
    2006. Our existing credit facility was extended by the lenders to fund 
    the repayment of certain indebtedness, to finance fees and expenses we 
    incurred in connection with our acquisition of Addus HealthCare, to 
    finance acquisitions, to provide working capital and to provide funds 
    for other general corporate purposes. Our existing credit facility has a 
    maturity date of September 19, 2011 and bears interest at a rate based 
    on either LIBOR or a floating rate equal to the higher of (i) the prime 
    rate as quoted by The Wall Street Journal and (ii) the Federal Funds Rate
    plus 0.50% per annum, plus, in each case, the applicable margin, with a 
    weighted average effective interest rate of 4.7% as of June 30, 2009. 

(3) In connection with our acquisition of Addus HealthCare, we entered into 
    a contingent payment agreement pursuant to which our Chairman of the 
    Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of Addus 
    HealthCare and certain of our other existing stockholders are entitled 
    to payments upon the completion of this offering.


(4) Represents the cash payment of $4.1 million of the $11.5 million of 
    accrued but unpaid dividends on our series A preferred stock in connection
    with the conversion of those shares into shares of our common stock. 
    Immediately prior to the completion of this offering, we will issue the

    The $0.1 million of unpaid dividends accrued on the shares of our series A
    preferred stock held by Freeport Loan Fund LLC will be paid in cash from 
    the net proceeds of the offering. Pursuant to the terms of the dividend 
    notes, we will be obligated to pay $4.0 million of the principal amount 
    of the dividend notes upon the completion of this offering. We will pay
    interest on the amount of the principal so prepaid together with each 
    payment of principal. Our series A preferred stock is owned by the Eos
    Funds and Freeport Loan Fund LLC, each of which has irrevocably elected 
    to convert its shares of series A preferred stock into common stock prior 
    to the completion of this offering. 

(5) Pursuant to a consent fee agreement, the Eos Funds will be paid this 
    amount in consideration for their agreement to waive certain rights under
    our stockholders’ agreement and registration rights agreement to permit 
    this offering to be completed, to convert their shares of series A 
    preferred stock into shares of our common stock immediately prior to the 
    completion of this offering and to accept dividend notes in respect of 
    the accrued and unpaid dividends thereon in lieu of cash. 

(6) The Chairman of Addus HealthCare has agreed to resign his position
    effective at the completion of this offering.

or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

by us of 7,666,667 shares of common stock in this offering, after deducting 
underwriting discounts of approximately $10.8 million. We will not receive 
any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds to us of approximately $121.2 million from 
this offering for: 

   •   the pro rata redemption of 41,899 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for
       approximately $72.5 million, which we will have outstanding immediately 
       after the corporate reorganization, including accumulated and undeclared
       dividends, 77.2% of which is held by IPC, 9.5% of which is held by the 
       Horowitz Family and 6.3% of which is held, collectively, by Blackstone 
       Mezzanine Partners L.P. and Blackstone Mezzanine Holdings L.P.; 
 
   •   the repurchase of approximately $45.2 million in aggregate principal 
       amount of our Notes and the payment of approximately $0.5 million of 
       related premiums; and 
 
   •   the payment of offering related expenses of approximately $3.1 million, 
       which includes a management services agreement fee of approximately 
       $750,000 to be paid to IPC. 
 
Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding Notes, we are 
obligated to apply 35% of the gross proceeds received by us from this offering 
to offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding Notes at a price of 101%, 
which represents an aggregate principal amount of $45.2 million. Any increase 
(decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price would increase 
(decrease) the aggregate principal amount of our Notes repurchased and the 
number of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock redeemed. 

As of September 25, 2009, the interest rate on our Notes, which mature in 2012,
was 7.94%, and the interest rate on our 2009 revolving credit facility, which 
matures in 2013, was 2.78%. 

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock and therefore may receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering."

upon the initial public offering price of $12.50 per share.

• $85 million to extinguish the remaining balance outstanding on the Hotel 
  and Wellness Center Debt, which currently bears interest at 3.24% and which 
  matures in March 2010;  

• $54 million to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility;

approximately $83.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and other estimated expenses (or approximately $111.4 million if 
the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares to
cover overallotments, if any). We will not receive any of the proceeds from 
the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. A member of our board of 
directors controls the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use $25.0 million of our net proceeds from this offering to repay 
indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. Affiliates of Merrill Lynch, 
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and Wells 
Fargo Securities, LLC are lenders of outstanding indebtedness under our 
revolving credit facility and will receive a portion of our net proceeds from 
this offering. As of June 30, 2009, we had $25.0 million outstanding under our 
revolving credit facility. The interest rate currently applicable to loans 
under our revolving credit facility is LIBOR plus 200 basis points. This rate 
is set periodically during the term of the loan. Our effective interest rate 
for the revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2009 was 2.32%. The revolving 
credit facility matures on July 20, 2011. In connection with the acquisition 
of the distribution rights from our former distributor in Italy in January 
2009, we borrowed an aggregate amount of $15.5 million under our revolving 
credit facility. In addition, in March 2009, we borrowed an additional amount 
of $9.5 million under our revolving credit facility, which was used for general
corporate purposes. As a result, we currently have no availability under our 
revolving credit facility. We will be permitted to reborrow any portion of the 
indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility that is repaid 
with a portion of our net proceeds from this offering. 

We intend to use $50.0 million of our net proceeds from this offering to prepay
the principal amount of our 10% senior subordinated PIK notes due 2012 that 
were issued in 2005, or the 2005 notes. In addition, we will use a portion of 
our net proceeds from this offering to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the 
2005 notes and the 10% senior subordinated PIK notes due 2012 that were issued 
in 2009, or the 2009 notes. If the underwriters exercise their option to 
purchase additional shares to cover overallotments, we will use a portion of 
the net proceeds therefrom to prepay the $15.0 million aggregate outstanding 
principal amount of the 2009 notes. As of June 30, 2009 the amount of accrued 
and unpaid interest on the 2005 notes was $2.5 million, and the amount of 
accrued and unpaid interest on the 2009 notes was $0.7 million. Our 2005 notes 
and 2009 notes are held by one of the WCAS Stockholders. The 2005 notes were 
issued in connection with our July 2005 reorganization at a discounted issue 
value of $43.5 million, and the 2009 notes were issued in connection with our 
acquisition of our former Italian distributor at a discounted issue value of 
$13.1 million. The 2005 notes are required to be prepaid at a price equal to 
100% of their face principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon 
occurrence of our initial public offering. The $6.5 million and $1.9 million 
of discount from the face value of the 2005 notes and 2009 notes, respectively,
are being accreted on our balance sheet to the senior subordinated notes 
repayment amounts utilizing the respective effective interest rates. As of 
June 30, 2009, the accreted value of our outstanding 2005 notes and 2009 notes 
on our balance sheet was $60.4 million. In connection with the repayment of 
the principal amount of our outstanding 2005 notes and 2009 notes, we will 
write off unamortized financing costs of $3.0 million and record a charge in 
the same amount to our statement of operations. Our effective interest rates 
under the 2005 notes and the 2009 notes as of June 30, 2009 were 12.6% and 
15.2%, respectively, compounded semiannually. 

We intend to use any remaining proceeds for working capital and general 
corporate purposes."

determined until the offering is complete, we currently anticipate that the 
gross proceeds from the sale of our common stock will be between $45.1 million,
at the minimum, and $67.7 million, at the adjusted maximum, of the offering 
range. We expect net proceeds from this offering to be between $42.5 million 
and $65.2 million, after payment of our offering expenses.
We expect to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:

After the payment of our conversion and offering expenses and commissions, we 
will use the net proceeds received from the sale of our shares of common stock
in the offering to make a loan to our ESOP in an amount sufficient to permit 
the ESOP to buy an amount equal to 9.99% of the shares sold in the offering. 
  
After using net proceeds to fund a loan to our ESOP, we expect to contribute 
most of the net proceeds from the offering to Penn Millers Insurance Company. 
Although the exact amount to be contributed to Penn Millers Insurance Company 
and the amount to be retained by Penn Millers Holding Corporation has not been
determined, it will be in part determined by the amount of net proceeds 
received in this offering. These net proceeds will supply additional capital 
that Penn Millers Insurance Company needs to support future growth in its net 
premiums written. The net proceeds contributed to the capital of Penn Millers 
Insurance Company will also be used for general corporate purposes, which may 
include reducing our reliance on reinsurance, furthering our geographic 
diversification through expansion of our producer network and marketing our 
PennEdge product. On a short-term basis, the net proceeds contributed to Penn
Millers Insurance Company will be invested primarily in U.S. government 
securities, other federal agency securities, and other securities consistent 
with our investment policy. 
  
Except for the loan to our ESOP, the contribution of capital to Penn Millers 
Insurance Company, the use of such proceeds for general corporate purposes, 
including the payment of debt service on our existing lines of credit, and the
possible purchase of stock to fund restricted stock awards and stock option 
grants, we currently have no specific plans, arrangements or understandings 
regarding the use of the net proceeds from this offering. 
  
As of August 30, 2009, the Company had $1.8 million outstanding under a line 
of credit. These borrowings were used to pay for the initial expenses incurred
for the offering and are part of the estimated $2.57 million of total 
conversion and offering expenses that will be paid from the gross proceeds. We
anticipate that aside from $1.8 million outstanding under the line of credit, 
none of the proceeds will be used for debt service. 
  
The amount of proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering will 
depend on the total number of shares actually sold. As a result, the net 
proceeds from the sale of common stock cannot be determined until the offering 
is completed."

particular uses for the net proceeds we will receive upon the completion of 
this offering. Accordingly, our management will have significant discretion in 
applying the net proceeds we will receive from the offering.

proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business conditions.
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus.

price equal to 103% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest 
to, but not including, the redemption date. The amounts borrowed under the 
senior secured notes on June 23, 2009 were used to repay in full our bridge 
loan facilities and accrued interest thereon, pay costs of terminating 
interest rate swap agreements entered into in connection with the loan 
facilities, and for general corporate purposes. The senior secured notes are

working capital and possible acquisitions, although we have no present

these net proceeds to repay all of the indebtedness outstanding under our 
credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., TD

bear interest at the LIBOR or base rate, at our option, plus an applicable 
margin ranging from 0% to 3.25% and a market disruption increase of between 
0.0% and 1.0%, if the lenders determine it applicable. The applicable rate was 
approximately 3.00% as of August 31, 2009. Borrowings under this agreement 
mature on July 21, 2012. We used the proceeds from indebtedness incurred 
during the past year to repay the outstanding indebtedness of our prior credit 
agreement, to fund two acquisitions that closed after the end of fiscal 2009 
and for other general working capital purposes. As of August 31, 2009, we had 
$65.8 million of total indebtedness outstanding under this agreement, and had 
$14.2 million of availability under the $55.0 million revolving credit facility

• approximately $5.5 million to fund the completion of our clinical trials and 
  our submission of the related NDA(s) to the FDA for our lead PharmacoSurgery 
  product candidate, OMS103HP;  
   
• approximately $30.5 million to fund the launch and commercialization of 
  OMS103HP;  
   
• approximately $11.0 million to fund the clinical development of our other 
  PharmacoSurgery product candidates, OMS302 and OMS201, through Phase 2 
  clinical trials; and  
   
• the remainder to continue to fund our pipeline of preclinical product 
  development programs focused on inflammation and CNS disorders, and to fund 
  working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions of products or 
  technologies and general corporate purposes.  

We may use a portion of the net proceeds for the repayment of a $17.0 million 
loan and related interest pursuant to the terms of a Loan and Security 
Agreement with BlueCrest Venture Finance Master Fund Limited, assignee of 
BlueCrest Capital Finance, L.P., dated as of September 12, 2008. We borrowed 
the $17.0 million in three tranches, one $5.0 million tranche in September 
2008 and two $6.0 million tranches in December 2008. The proceeds of this 
borrowing have been used for working capital and general corporate activities. 
Our obligations under the agreement are secured by a first priority security 
interest in our assets excluding intellectual property. We are required to pay 
only interest on amounts borrowed during the first three months, and 
thereafter the amount borrowed is amortized over 36 months with equal monthly 
principal and interest payments. The interest rate of the debt is 12.50%. We 
have the right to prepay the principal amount of the loan in whole, but not in 
part, upon 30 days advance written notice to BlueCrest. If we prepay the loan, 
we will be required to pay BlueCrest a prepayment premium equal to two percent 
of the principal amount of any part of the loan that has been outstanding for 
18 months or less and one percent for any amount that has been outstanding for 
more than 18 months. In connection with this financing arrangement, we are 
obligated to pay a one-time fee to BlueCrest in the amount of $340,000 upon 
closing of this offering.
  
We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to purchase 
assets for our GPCR program pursuant to the terms of an Exclusive Technology 
Option Agreement with Patobios Limited. Under this agreement, we have the 
right to purchase Patobios’ assets related to a GPCR assay technology, 
comprised of patents and other intellectual property rights, for approximately 
$10.8 million Canadian dollars, or CAD, of which $7.8 million CAD is payable 
in cash and $3.0 million CAD is payable in our common stock, subject to 
adjustment as described below. Upon signing the agreement, we paid Patobios a 
$200,000 CAD cash option fee ($188,000 USD) for the right to test and 
exclusive option to purchase the assets during the nine-month period ending 
June 4, 2009. On June 12, 2009 we paid Patobios an additional $522,000 CAD 
cash option fee ($471,000 USD) to extend the option period until December 4, 
2009. We have the option to extend this period for one additional six-month 
period ending June 4, 2010 by paying Patobios a cash option fee of $650,000 
CAD. If during any option period we purchase these assets, the cash portion of 
the purchase price will be reduced by a portion of the related option fee we 
paid for such period based on the number of days remaining in the period. In 
addition, if during an option period we identify a set of molecules, or 
ligands, that binds to an orphan GPCR using the assay technology, Patobios 
will have the option to require us to purchase these assets for the same price 
we would be required to pay if we elected to purchase them. While we are 
currently evaluating the utility of these assets for our GPCR program, we are
not required to and are not currently attempting to identify any ligands that 
bind to an orphan GPCR using the assay technology.
  
The expected uses of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
current intentions based on our present plans and business conditions. As of 
the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the 
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received from this offering. The 
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors 
including the progress in, and costs of, our clinical trials and other 
preclinical development programs. Accordingly, our management will have broad 
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be 
relying on the judgement of management regarding the application of the net 
proceeds from the offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the 
net proceeds for other purposes. Pending such uses set forth above, we plan to 
invest the net proceeds in highly liquid, investment grade securities."

R$12.1 billion, or U.S.$6.9 billion, based on the price set forth on the cover
page of this prospectus, converted by a selling exchange rate of R$1.7533 to
U.S.$1.00 reported by the Central Bank on October 6, 2009. The total estimated
net proceeds include approximately R$5.3 billion from the subscription of our
units in the Brazilian offering, or R$6.0 billion if the Brazilian underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, and approximately U.S.$4.0 billion
from the sale of our units, directly or in the form of ADSs in the international
offering, or U.S.$4.6 billion if the international underwriters exercise the
over-allotment option in full, in each case, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offerings that are
payable by us. Each ADS represents one unit. Each U.S.$1.00 increase (decrease)
in the public offering price per ADS would increase (decrease) our net proceeds,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses,
by R$902.9 million, or U.S.$515 million (assuming no exercise of the
over-allotment option by the international underwriters).
 
We intend to use the net proceeds from the global offering to expand our
business in Brazil by growing our physical presence and increasing our capital
base. We also intend to enhance our funding structure and, along with our
traditional funding sources, increase our current credit transactions.
 
In particular, we estimate that we will use: (1) 70% of the net proceeds to
expand our physical infrastructure, including by opening new branches and
installing additional ATMs, and to fund increased credit transactions in our
Commercial Banking and Global Wholesale Banking segments more efficiently than
we could do with ordinary funding sources; (2) 20% of the net proceeds to
improve our funding structure; and (3) 10% of the net proceeds to increase our
capital base, improving our Basel capital adequacy ratio."

after deducting estimated underwriting discounts. We expect to (i) contribute 
up to $323.9 million of the net proceeds from this offering to our subsidiary, 
Education Management LLC, to repay a portion of its indebtedness, as described 
below, (ii) pay $10.9 million of the approximately $29.5 million termination 
fee under the Sponsor Management Agreement and (iii) pay an estimated $3.6 
million in offering expenses. 
  
On September 21, 2009, Education Management LLC commenced a tender offer to 
purchase for cash a portion of its 8 3/4% senior notes due 2014, which we 
refer to as senior notes, and 10 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2016, 
which we refer to as senior subordinated notes. It is offering to purchase an 
aggregate principal amount of these notes such that the maximum aggregate 
consideration for all notes purchased in the tender offer, excluding accrued 
and unpaid interest, will be $323.9 million. Education Management LLC intends 
to accept for purchase notes tendered in the tender offer based on the 
following priority: (1) first, the maximum aggregate principal amount of senior
subordinated notes validly tendered on a pro rata basis that can be purchased, 
such that the maximum aggregate consideration for senior subordinated notes, 
excluding accrued and unpaid interest, will be $323.9 million and 
(2) thereafter, the maximum aggregate principal amount of senior notes validly 
tendered on a pro rata basis that can be purchased, if any, such that the 
aggregate consideration paid for all senior notes and senior subordinated notes
purchased in the tender offer, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, will be 
$323.9 million. The tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, the 
completion of this offering. If any condition of the tender offer is not 
satisfied, Education Management LLC is not obligated to accept for purchase, or
to pay for, any notes tendered and may delay the acceptance for payment of any 
tendered notes, in each case subject to applicable laws. 
  
Holders of senior subordinated notes and senior notes will receive $1,110 and 
$1,070, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest for each $1,000 
principal amount of such notes that are validly tendered on or before 
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 5, 2009 and accepted for purchase in 
the tender offer. Holders of senior subordinated notes and senior notes will 
receive $1,080 and $1,040, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest for 
each $1,000 principal amount of such notes that are validly tendered after 
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 5, 2009 but on or before 5:00 p.m., 
New York City time, on October 19, 2009 and accepted for purchase in the 
tender offer. 
  
We believe that affiliates of certain of the Sponsors own in the aggregate 
approximately $81 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior 
subordinated notes. To the extent that an affiliate of a Sponsor validly 
tenders all or any portion of its senior subordinated notes in the tender 
offer and such senior subordinated notes are accepted for purchase in the 
tender offer, such affiliate indirectly will receive a portion of the proceeds 
from this offering. 
  
As of June 30, 2009, the outstanding aggregate principal amounts of the senior 
notes and senior subordinated notes were $375.0 million and $385.0 million, 
respectively. Unless we specifically state otherwise, the information in this 
prospectus assumes that Education Management LLC will purchase in the tender 
offer $151.4 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes for $162.0 
million and $145.9 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated 
notes for $161.9 million. However, Education Management LLC may not be able to 
consummate the tender offer on the terms described above. It may modify the 
terms of the tender offer, including pricing terms or the maximum consideration
to be paid for notes that are validly tendered, or it may extend or terminate 
the tender offer, at any time prior to its consummation, which may result in 
it spending more or less than $323.9 million in connection with the tender 
offer. If Education Management LLC applies less than $323.9 million of net 
proceeds from this offering contributed to it to repurchase notes in the 
tender offer, it intends to use any remaining amounts of those net proceeds 
contributed to it for general corporate purposes, which may include the 
repayment, redemption or refinancing of its indebtedness, including 
indebtedness under its senior secured credit facilities, the material terms.
  
This prospectus is not an offer to purchase senior notes or senior subordinated
notes. Education Management LLC’s tender offer is made only by and pursuant to 
the terms of the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal, each
dated as of September 21, 2009. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any shares of our common 
stock pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares for 
general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of additional debt.
  
Other than the termination fee described above, no fees are payable to any of 
the Sponsors under the Sponsor Management Agreement from the proceeds of this 
offering. Goldman, Sachs & Co., an affiliate of one of the Sponsors, will 
receive customary underwriting compensation in connection with this offering."

28,947,368 shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately 
$514.8 million, based on the initial public offering price of $19.00 per 
share, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions 
and offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from 
the sale of shares by the selling stockholder, including if the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional shares. 

We intend to use $386.1 million and $128.7 million of the net proceeds to us 
from this offering to pay amounts owed under our First and Second Lien Term 
Loans, respectively. 

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. Our management will 
retain broad discretion over the allocation of any net proceeds used for 
general corporate purposes. 

The proceeds from the First and Second Lien Term Loans, in conjunction with a 
$67.3 million draw under our Revolving Credit Agreement, all entered into on 
December 6, 2006, were used to repay and retire all outstanding principal and 
interest amounts owed under our then existing $440.0 million asset-based 
credit facility, as amended, repay and retire all outstanding principal and 
interest amounts owed to Cerberus and Ampersand under our then existing 12% 
Second Lien Notes, and pay accrued interest of $23.4 million to Talecris
Holdings, LLC under the terms of our then existing 14% Junior Secured
Convertible Notes, which was converted into 900,000 shares of Series A 
convertible preferred stock at the holder's election. Further, we used the 
proceeds from our First and Second Lien Term Loans and our Revolving Credit 
Agreement to pay a cash dividend of $760.0 million to Talecris Holdings, LLC,
pay a special recognition bonus of $34.2 million to eligible employees and
board of director members, and fund an irrevocable trust for $23.0 million 
for future payments under this special recognition bonus. 

The First and Second Lien Term loans bear interest based upon either the
Alternate Base Rate (ABR) or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our 
option, plus applicable margins. The ABR represents the greater of the Federal 
Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% or the Prime Rate. The First Lien Term Loan 
accrues interest at ABR plus 2.25% or LIBOR plus 3.50% and matures on December
6, 2013 and the Second Lien Term Loan accrues interest at ABR plus 5.25% or 
LIBOR plus 6.50% and matures on December 6, 2014. For the six months ended 
June 30, 2009, the weighted average interest rates on borrowings under our 
First and Second Lien Term Loans were 4.94% and 7.98%, respectively. At June 
30, 2009, the interest rates on borrowings under our First and Second Lien 
Term Loans were 4.42% and 7.42%, respectively."

shareholders. If any of our Shareholders exercise Options which they own, 
we will receive the proceeds from the exercising of the Options, but not the 
subsequent sale of those Shares. We will receive proceeds from the sale of any 
of the Company owned shares and will use the proceeds of these sales in the 
following manner: 
  
Approximately $200,000 of the proceeds from the sale of our common stock will 
be used to pay the costs of general overhead expenses, consulting and 
management fees, the costs to establish the marketing and sales/leasing force 
required to sell the products and services, for working capital and for 
expansion of our operations. Additional financing will likely be required if 
we are to fully expand our operations and fully market and sell our products 
and services. 

Approximately $250,000 would be used to purchase and/or lease the equipment 
that is necessary for our continued operation in Ridgefield. Approximately 
$175,000 will be used to establish the marketing and sales force required to 
sell our product and to further expand our operations. Approximately $500,000 
would be used to support and fund expansion of our operations into other 
markets, which would include general overhead, office personnel, office and 
yard leases, and money needed to support cash flow requirements. 

Approximately $1,500,000 would be used to purchase equipment we now lease, 
including trucks and processing machine, which would reduce our overhead for 
these items by approximately $34,400 per month. Any remaining monies would 
be used at the absolute discretion of the directors and management of the 
company to expand into new markets when or if they feel the time is 
appropriate. There is no assurance that such additional financing will be 
available to use and, if available, that the terms and conditions of such 
financing will be acceptable to us. 

In the event that our plans change, our assumptions change or prove to be 
inaccurate, or the proceeds from the sale of our common stock prove to be 
insufficient, it may be necessary or advisable to reallocate proceeds for other
purposes, or we may be required to seek additional financing, or we may be 
required to curtail our operations."

 (2)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of 
      the insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting 
      discounts are reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon 
      consummation of the offering. An additional $1,440,000, or $1,818,000 if 
      the over-allotment option is exercised in full, representing the entire 
      7% discount payable on any units sold pursuant to the over-allotment 
      option, all of which will be deposited in trust following the 
      consummation of the offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and 
      when we consummate a business combination.  

 (3)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at 
      $200,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest 
      income earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of 
      taxes owed on such interest income) will be available to us to pay for 
      our working capital requirements. We anticipate having approximately 
      $250,000 (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) available 
      to us. For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is 
      shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately 
      following the offering.  

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, MCK Capital Co., 
Limited, Eli D. Scher and Larry Wizel have committed to purchase the insider 
warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $1,800,000) from us. These 
purchases will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the 
consummation of this offering. We will not pay any discounts or commissions 
with respect to the purchase of the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we 
receive from this purchase will be placed in the trust account.

$36,000,000, or $41,410,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, 
of net proceeds of this offering, including the $1,800,000 we will receive from
the sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at  , 
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, 
as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts and 
commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have
agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate a 
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon 
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The funds 
held in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities” 
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 
1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the 
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to any interest income that may be 
released to us (i) that we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations 
and (ii) any remaining interest that we need for working capital requirements, 
the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of 
the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. If the 
underwriters determine the size of the offering should be increased or 
decreased, such an increase or decrease in offering size could also result in 
a proportionate increase or decrease in the amount of interest we may withdraw 
from the trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as 
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a 
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of 
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business. 

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar 
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, 
or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order 
to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the 
type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive 
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection 
with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business 
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar 
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. 
Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held 
in trust and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and other third-party 
expenses attendant to the search for target businesses and to the due 
diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation of a business 
combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses by our officers, 
directors and initial shareholders” and “Working capital to cover miscellaneous
expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation obligations 
and reserves.” Since the role of present management after a business 
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, 
if any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net 
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working 
capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be 
approximately $200,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interst income) may 
be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for 
a business combination. We intend to use the excess working capital available 
for miscellaneous expenses for director and officer liability insurance 
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, 
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business 
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders in connection with 
activities on our behalf. We will also be entitled to have interest earned on 
the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any tax obligations 
that we may owe. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover the 
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the funds
not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us with 
our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” 
provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses 
from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more 
favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed 
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. 
If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive 
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down 
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms
of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at 
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or 
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue 
searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target 
businesses. 

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust 
account, along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these 
funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may 
reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories. 

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, 
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is 
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business 
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any 
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the 
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in 
a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ 
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and 
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to 
repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to 
the completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside
of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay 
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust 
account. If such funds are insufficient, Jing Dong Gao and Eli D. Scher have 
agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation 
(currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have 
agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. 

Eli D. Scher has advanced to us $125,000 which was used to pay a portion of 
the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC 
registration fee, FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees 
and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the consummation of 
this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering 
available to us for payment of offering expenses. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the 
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business 
combination is not consummated during that time. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) 
only in the event of our liquidation or if that public shareholder converts 
such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which we 
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right 
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding 
indebtedness under our senior notes, to fund working capital and for other 
general corporate purposes, which may include the expansion of our hotel chain 
and the improvement of existing leased-and-operated hotels. 

The following table sets forth a summary of our outstanding senior notes as of 
September 30, 2009. Our outstanding senior notes will become due and payable, 
in full, within 60 days after the completion of this offering.

(1) The original borrowings under our senior notes are denominated in U.S. 
    dollars and are converted into Renminbi for convenience purposes using the 
    exchange rate in effect as of September 30, 2009.  

(2) The senior notes are secured by, among other things, a pledge of our 
    shares of 7 Days Shenzhen which holds directly or indirectly all our 
    operating assets in China. The senior note proceeds have been used to fund 
    the expansion of our hotel chain and for working capital purposes.  

(3) Reflects the interest rate as of September 30, 2009, which is calculated 
    based on LIBOR plus 8%, adjusted semi-annually.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we 
are permitted, under PRC regulations, to provide funding to our PRC 
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to 
satisfaction of applicable government registrations and approval requirements, 
we may extend inter-company loans or make additional capital contributions to 
our PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. We 
may be unable to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely
basis, if at all.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and 
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans 
and business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility 
and discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The occurrence 
of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application 
of the net proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in 
this prospectus. 

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not 
immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net 
proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, debt instruments or bank deposits. 
These investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal 
income tax consequences of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible we may 
become a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes, which could result in negative tax consequences for you."

million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions in connection 
with this offering of $25.2 million, all of which will be used to repay 
amounts owed to RTEA. Immediately prior to the completion of this offering, we 
will enter into an acquisition agreement, or the Acquisition Agreement, with 
RTEA pursuant to which we will acquire a portion of RTEA's interest in Rio 
Tinto America's western U.S. coal business (other than the Colowyo mine) 
represented by 30,600,000 common membership units of CPE LLC, and, as 
consideration, will issue to RTEA the CPE Note. The number of common 
membership units of CPE LLC purchased from RTEA will equal the number of 
shares of common stock sold in this offering. The amount of the CPE Note will 
equal the public offering price of our common stock, less underwriting 
discounts and commissions. The Acquisition Agreement will require us to use 
the net proceeds of this offering to immediately repay the CPE Note. 
Accordingly, we will not retain any of the proceeds of this offering. This 
offering, the senior notes offering and the closing of CPE LLC's revolving 
credit facility are each conditioned upon the closing of each other 
transaction. 

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full to purchase 
up to an additional 4,590,000 shares of our common stock to cover 
over-allotments of shares, then the net proceeds from this offering will be 
approximately $498.8 million. We will use any net proceeds from the o
ver-allotments to purchase an equivalent number of common membership units in 
CPE LLC held by RTEA at a price per unit equal to the public offering price 
per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. 

We expect the net proceeds of CPE LLC's senior notes offering to be 
approximately $583.3 million, after deducting original issue discount and 
initial purchasers' discounts and commissions. We expect that approximately 
$307.5 million of the net proceeds will be distributed to RTEA immediately 
following the closing of the senior notes offering. The remaining net proceeds 
from the senior notes offering will be used for general corporate purposes,
including the payment of fees under CPE LLC's revolving credit facility, as 
cash reserves for securing our reclamation obligations and for capital 
expenditure requirements.

The following table sets forth the sources and uses of funds that we expect to 
receive in connection with this offering and the senior notes offering (in 
millions).

shares of our common stock in this offering, after deducting underwriter 
discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us, will be 
approximately $445.2 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale 
of shares of our common stock by the selling shareholder (including any shares 
sold by the selling shareholder pursuant to the underwriters' option to 
purchase additional shares). 

We intend to use the anticipated net proceeds as follows: (1) $229.6 million 
of the net proceeds will be applied to redeem $205.2 million in aggregate 
principal amount of our 11.875%/12.625% senior subordinated toggle notes due 
2017 (the ""Senior Subordinated Notes"") at a redemption price of 111.875% and 
(2) the remaining $215.6 million of the net proceeds will be applied to redeem 
$194.9 million in aggregate principal amount of our 10.625% senior notes due 
2015 (the ""Senior Notes"", and, together with the Senior Subordinated Notes, 
the ""Notes"") at a redemption price of 110.625%. Each such redemption will be 
made pursuant to a provision of the applicable indenture that permits us 
to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes with the 
net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. In each case, we will pay 
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes through the redemption date with cash 
generated from operations. 

As of the date hereof, there is approximately $1.175 billion aggregate 
principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding, which bear interest at a rate of 
10.625% per annum and mature on July 15, 2015 and $655.9 million aggregate 
principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes outstanding, which bear cash 
interest at a rate of 11.875% per annum and mature on July 15, 2017. 

Affiliates of several of the underwriters hold the Notes, some of which may be 
retired with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. As a result, 
some of the underwriters or their affiliates may receive part of the proceeds

stock offered by us will be approximately $25.1 million based upon the initial
public offering price of $19.00 per share, and after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of 
our common stock by the selling stockholders, including any shares sold by 
certain of the selling stockholders in connection with the exercise of the 
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering 
for the repayment of approximately $25.1 million of our outstanding 
indebtedness. We currently intend to use the remaining net proceeds, if any,
for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of August 1, 2009
and November 6, 2009, we had $29.2 million and $29.0 million, respectively, 
of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility with Bank 
of America, N.A., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith 
Incorporated, an underwriter in this offering. Immediately prior to the
completion of this offering, we anticipate the outstanding borrowings under
our senior secured credit facility will be approximately $30.0 million. 
In April 2008, we used borrowings under our senior secured credit facility
to discharge all of our long-term debt, accrued monitoring fees payable to 
Apax Partners and a commitment fee payable to Bank of America, N.A. Our 
revolving credit facility has a maturity date of April 10, 2013 and is 
expandable at our option in increments of $5.0 million up to a limit of $85.0
million under certain defined conditions. Availability under our senior
secured credit facility is collateralized by a first priority interest in 
all of our assets. The revolving credit facility accrues interest at the Bank 
of America base rate, defined at our option as the prime rate or the 
Eurodollar rate plus applicable margin, which ranges from 1.25% to 2.00% set 
quarterly dependent upon average net availability under the senior secured 
credit facility during the previous quarter. The weighted-average interest 
rate under the revolving credit facility was 1.32% for the twenty-six weeks 
ended August 1, 2009. We intend to obtain an amendment of certain provisions 
of our senior secured credit facility in connection with this offering.

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we intend 
to invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing 
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct 
or guaranteed obligations of the United States government. 
 
By establishing a public market for our common stock, this offering is also 
intended to facilitate our future access to public markets."

under our credit facilities, to pay $2.6 million to terminate an advisory 
services and monitoring agreement we entered into in connection with the DLJ 
Transactions, and any remaining proceeds for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. 

As of June 30, 2009, we had $256.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our 
credit facilities. The principal amounts of our term loans under our first

on June 15, 2014. The term loans under our second lien credit facility mature 
on December 15, 2014. Borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at 
variable rates. As of June 30, 2009, the weighted average interest rate under 
our credit facilities was 4.14%, before the effect of our interest rate swap.

payable by us. 

Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds
of this offering. We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering as 
follows: 

 •   approximately $30.0 million to build a factory to manufacture cold-set 
     corrugated paper machines at our Langfang Duoyuan facility;  
   
 •   approximately $10.0 million to improve and upgrade our existing 
     manufacturing facilities and production lines; and

We pursue acquisitions of other businesses as part of our business strategy 
and may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund acquisitions. We have no 
agreement with respect to any future acquisition, although we assess 
opportunities on an ongoing basis and from time to time have discussions with 
other companies about potential transactions.

variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term or long-term 
interest-bearing, marketable securities.

estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds

December 5, 2012 and had an outstanding balance of approximately $114.7

(the “alternative maximum aggregate consideration”). 

The tender offer is subject to the condition that our senior subordinated 
notes with an aggregate principal amount equal to at least $191.2 million are 
validly tendered as of the early tender date for the tender offer (the 
“minimum condition”), which is December 15, 2009. The tender offer is also 
conditioned upon the consummation of this offering and specified general 
conditions. If any condition of the tender offer is not satisfied, we will not
be obligated to accept for purchase, or to pay for, any notes tendered and may
delay the acceptance for payment of any tendered notes, in each case subject 
to applicable laws. 

If the minimum condition is satisfied as of the early tender date, we intend 
to accept for purchase notes tendered in the tender offer based on the 
following priority: (1) first, the maximum aggregate principal amount of our 
senior subordinated notes validly tendered on a pro rata basis that can be 
purchased such that the maximum aggregate consideration for senior 
subordinated notes, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, will be $213.6 
million, (2) second, the maximum aggregate principal amount of fixed senior 
notes validly tendered on a pro rata basis that can be purchased, if any, such
that the aggregate consideration paid for all senior subordinated notes and 
fixed senior notes purchased in the tender offer, excluding accrued and 
unpaid interest, will be $213.6 million and (3) thereafter, the maximum 
aggregate principal amount of floating senior notes validly tendered on a pro 
rata basis that can be purchased, if any, such that the aggregate 
consideration paid for all senior subordinated notes, fixed senior notes and 
floating senior notes purchased in the tender offer, excluding accrued and 
unpaid interest, will be $213.6 million.

If the minimum condition is not satisfied as of the early tender date, we may
choose in our sole discretion to waive such condition so that we will proceed 
with the tender offer in the same manner as if the minimum condition had been 
satisfied except that, even though all validly tendered senior subordinated 
notes would be purchased, less than $191.2 million aggregate principal amount
of senior subordinated notes would be purchased. Alternatively, if the 
minimum condition is not satisfied as of the early tender date, we may choose 
in our sole discretion to waive the minimum condition so that we will not 
purchase any senior subordinated notes in the tender offer and the maximum 
aggregate consideration for fixed senior notes and floating senior notes 
purchased in the tender offer, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, will be
$49.975 million. We then would accept for purchase (1) first, the maximum 
aggregate principal amount of fixed senior notes validly tendered on a pro 
rata basis that can be purchased such that the maximum aggregate consideration
for fixed senior notes, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, will be 
$49.975 million and (2) thereafter, the maximum aggregate principal amount 
of floating senior notes validly tendered on a pro rata basis that can be 
purchased, if any, such that the maximum aggregate consideration for fixed 
senior notes and floating senior notes, excluding accrued and unpaid 
interest, will be $49.975 million. 

Holders of senior subordinated notes, fixed senior notes and floating senior
notes will receive $1,080, $1,060 and $940, respectively, plus accrued and 
unpaid interest, for each $1,000 principal amount of notes that are validly 
tendered on or before December 15, 2009 and accepted for purchase in the 
tender offer. Holders of senior subordinated notes, fixed senior notes and 
floating senior notes will receive $1,040, $1,020 and $900, respectively, 
plus accrued and unpaid interest, for each $1,000 principal amount of such 
notes that are validly tendered after December 15, 2009 but on or before 
December 30, 2009 and accepted for purchase in the tender offer. 

As of November 30, 2009, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 
senior subordinated notes, fixed senior notes and floating senior notes was 
$425.0 million, $450.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. Unless we 
specifically state otherwise, the information in this prospectus assumes 
that we will purchase in the tender offer $191.2 million aggregate principal
amount of senior subordinated notes for $206.6 million, $3.3 million 
aggregate principal amount of senior fixed notes for $3.5 million, and $3.7
million aggregate principal amount of senior floating notes for $3.5 million.
We may not, however, be able to consummate the tender offer on the terms 
described above or at all. We may modify the terms of the tender offer, 
including pricing terms or the maximum consideration to be paid for notes 
that are validly tendered, or we may extend or terminate the tender offer, 
at any time prior to its consummation, which may result in our spending more
or less than $213.6 million in connection with the tender offer. If we apply
less than $213.6 million of net proceeds from this offering to repurchase 
notes in the tender offer, we intend to use any remaining amounts of those 
net proceeds for the other purposes described above in lieu of using cash 
on hand or for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment 
or redemption of our indebtedness, including the repayment of additional 
indebtedness under our senior secured term loan or the redemption of notes 
pursuant to the optional redemption provisions. These optional redemption
provisions include, without limitation, provisions that permit us, on or 
before May 1, 2010, at our option, to redeem up to 35% of each tranche of 
notes with the proceeds of certain sales of our equity (which would include 
the sale of shares in this offering) at the applicable redemption price 
listed or that permit us, on or before May 1, 2010 for the fixed senior 
notes or May 1, 2011 for the senior subordinated notes, at our option, to 
redeem the fixed senior notes or senior subordinated notes at a price equal 
to 100% of the principal amount plus the applicable premium (as defined in 
the applicable indenture).

& Co. as documentation agent and affiliates of certain of the underwriters 
are lenders with respect to our senior secured credit facilities and will

$42.4 million if the underwriters exercise in full the option to purchase 
additional shares. 

We intend to use $213.6 million of the net proceeds from this offering to 
repay and/or repurchase amounts under one or more of our senior subordinated
notes, fixed senior notes and floating senior notes, which may include 
a tender offer for cash or the redemption of notes pursuant to the optional 
redemption provisions. We also intend to use approximately $64.1 million of the 
net proceeds from this offering, together with approximately $200 million of 
cash on hand, to repay $250 million of outstanding borrowings under our senior 
secured term loan, which matures on October 19, 2013, pay $3.6 million of 
senior secured term loan amendment fees and pay $10.5 million of termination 
fees to our Equity Sponsors in connection with the termination of our financial 
advisory agreements with each of them. If the underwriters exercise their 
option to purchase additional shares, we intend to use the additional net 
proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include additional repayments

$327.6 million after deducting the full underwriting discount and other 
estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters’ overallotment option is 
exercised in full, our net proceeds will be approximately $376.9 million. 
Concurrently with the completion of this offering, we will sell to Messrs. 
Bortz and Martz an aggregate of 135,000 common shares in the concurrent 
private placement at a price per share equal to the public offering price per 
share in this offering shown on the cover of this prospectus, without payment 
of any underwriting discount, yielding $2.7 million of net proceeds to us. 
  
The underwriters will forego the receipt of payment of $.40 per share, until 
such time as we purchase assets in accordance with our investment strategy at 
least equal to the net proceeds from this offering (after deducting the full 
underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses payable by us), at 
which time, we have agreed to pay the underwriters an amount equal to $.40 per 
share sold in this offering. 
  
We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement to our operating partnership. Our operating partnership will invest 
these net proceeds in hotel properties in accordance with our investment 
strategy. Prior to the full investment of the net proceeds in hotel properties,
we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing short-term investment 
grade securities or money-market accounts which are consistent with our 
intention to qualify as a REIT. Such investments may include, for example, 
government and government agency certificates, certificates of deposit, 
interest-bearing bank deposits and mortgage loan participations. These initial 
investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to 
achieve from investments in hotel properties. We will use approximately 
$100,000 of the proceeds of this offering to reimburse Mr. Bortz for 
out-of-pocket expenses he incurred in connection with our formation and this 
offering and $1,000 to repurchase the shares he acquired in connection with 
the formation and initial capitalization of our company."
