common units offered by this prospectus of approximately $412.6 million, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, structuring fees and 
offering expenses. We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this 
offering, after repayment of the $112 million of borrowings currently 
outstanding under our revolving credit facility and payment of fees of $5.5 
million in connection with the amendment of such revolving credit facility, 
to fund expansion capital expenditures. We currently have several anticipated 
projects that we estimate will, in the aggregate, involve approximately 
$223.5 million of expansion capital expenditures for the twelve months ending 
June 30, 2011, with the remainder to be used for additional capital 
expenditures in future periods. These projects are related to the continued 
expansion of our existing gathering systems in our Barnett Shale and 
Mid-Continent regions to meet the needs of our two largest customers, 
Chesapeake and Total. 

As of July 1, 2010, we had $112 million of borrowings outstanding under our 
revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 3.35%. 
Our revolving credit facility matures in June 2015. Borrowings under our 
revolving credit facility have been used primarily to fund portions of $75 
million distributions to each of Chesapeake and GIP and for working capital 
purposes. 

The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and 
perform services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business. 
Affiliates of substantially all of the underwriters are lenders under our 
revolving credit facility and will, in that respect, receive a portion of the 
proceeds from this offering through the repayment of borrowings outstanding
under our revolving credit facility."

offering (based on an initial public offering price of $9.00 per share), 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions (including the fee 
to be paid to FT Partners, as described under “Underwriting”) and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $36.8 million or 
approximately $42.6 million assuming the underwriters exercise the 
over-allotment option in full. We intend to use the proceeds from this 
offering for general corporate purposes, including for selective strategic 
investments through acquisitions, alliances or other transactions. However, 
we have no transactions planned currently and, therefore, the timing and 
amount of our use of the proceeds from this offering will be based on many 
factors, including our ability to identify attractive transaction 
opportunities, the amount of our cash flows from operations and the 
anticipated growth of our business. An additional reason for this offering 
is to provide our stockholders with liquidity in the public equity markets. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling 
stockholders."

from the sale of shares of our common stock in this offering (or $421.6 million 
if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in
full), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses that we must pay.
 
Under our current business plan, we intend to spend approximately $511 million 
through 2012 to restart mining operations, construct and refurbish processing 
facilities and other infrastructure at the Mountain Pass facility and expand 
into metals and alloys production, the costs of which we refer to as our 
modernization and expansion costs. We also plan to use up to approximately 
$27.4 million, all of which is expected to be used in 2010, for letters of 
credit and/or cash collateral to secure surety bonds issued for the benefit 
of certain regulatory agencies in connection with our Mountain Pass facility 
closure and reclamation obligation, which we refer to as our cash collateral 
requirements. Our estimated capital expenditures of $511 million do not 
include corporate, selling, general and administrative expenses, which we 
estimate to be an additional $5 million to $10 million per year. We presently 
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of our
modernization and expansion costs and all of our cash collateral requirements.
We anticipate that the remainder of our modernization and expansion costs will
be funded through traditional debt financing, project financing, additional 
public or private equity offerings and/or federal government programs 
including the U.S. Department of Energy loan guarantee program for which we 
submitted an application in June 2010. Because our modernization and expansion
costs will be expended through 2012, we may choose alternative funding for our 
modernization and expansion costs, including other sources from our financing 
plan, in which case any remaining net proceeds from this offering may be used 
for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to fund our 
working capital requirements and to develop new products, processes and 
technologies, both through acquisitions and capital programs.
 
Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering as described above, we 
plan to invest the proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, 
including short-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade 
instruments, certificates of deposit and direct guaranteed obligations of the 
United States."

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as follows: 
   
• to repay the outstanding balance under our $50 million revolving senior
  secured credit facility ($24.9 million outstanding as of March 31, 2010
  and $31.4 million outstanding as of June 30, 2010), which as of March 31,
  2010 bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 2.49% per annum and
  matures on June 30, 2011;  
   
• approximately $3.0 million to repay in full, the entire principal amount
  of and accrued but unpaid interest on the subordinated note held by
  Mr. Sakellaris, which currently bears interest at 10.0% per annum and is
  payable on demand; and  
   
• the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
  which may include opening additional offices in the United States and
  abroad, expanding sales and marketing activities, funding the development
  and construction of our small-scale renewable energy projects and other
  capital expenditures.  

We may use a portion of the net proceeds that we receive from this offering
to expand our current business through acquisitions of complementary 
companies, assets or technologies. Although we are engaged in discussions 
with respect to a potential acquisition for consideration of less than 
$10 million, we currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements 
to make any acquisitions. 
  
Pending specific utilization of the net proceeds as described above, we 
intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term investment

We have no current specific plan for the net proceeds from this offering

purposes, as well as funding possible future strategic acquisitions. 
In addition, this offering will create a public market for our shares 
for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by 
providing them with equity incentives, and enhance our ability to use 
our shares as purchase consideration in future acquisitions. 
  
The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use 
and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present

for fund allocation would change if the amount we raise in this offering

Please note that the increased capacity noted above does not take into 
consideration Fengze’s ninth hog farm, which will increase Fengze’s capacity

acquisitions or construction agreements on terms that are acceptable to us, 
we reserve the right to allocate such funds to our working capital purposes. 
There are no understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any 
such transaction at this time. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in 
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments 
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences

public offering price of $10.00 per share and after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses that 
we must pay. 
  
We intend to use approximately $6.1 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering to repay in full the principal and accrued interest and to pay any 
applicable prepayment fee on our outstanding loan from Stiftelsen 
Industrifonden, based on amounts accrued as of March 31, 2010. The loan has 
an interest rate of 10% per annum and has a maturity date of March 2012. The 
loan is subject to a prepayment fee of an amount equal to interest on the 
amount prepaid from the date of prepayment through March 31, 2012 at a rate 
equal to one-half the Swedish Reference Rate (0.25% as of March 31, 2010) 
applicable on the date of prepayment. We used the net proceeds of this loan 
for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
  
We intend to use the remaining net proceeds of this offering for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital needs. While we have not 
allocated the remaining net proceeds of this offering to specified general 
corporate purposes, we may utilize such proceeds by allocating them amongst 
the following categories: expansion of our domestic and international sales 
and marketing activities; technology infrastructure to help increase 
transaction volume and further enhance our software products and develop new 
software solutions; increase awareness of our solutions and expand our 
customer base; and development of marketing, sales and other promotional 
programs to sell products to our existing and future customers. We believe 
opportunities may exist to expand our current business through strategic 
acquisitions and investments in technology, and we may use a portion of the 
proceeds for these purposes. We are not currently a party to any contracts 
or letters of intent, nor do we have any arrangements or understandings, 
with respect to any strategic acquisitions or investments. The amount of net 
proceeds to be utilized for strategic acquisitions has not been determined. 
  
The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts 
we actually expend in these areas may vary significantly from our current 
intentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including future sales 
growth, success of our engineering efforts, cash generated from future 
operations, if any, and actual expenses to operate our business. As of the 
date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the 
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this 
offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the 
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this 
offering. 
  
Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in 
a variety of capital preservation instruments, including short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or 
direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States government."

commissions (based on an underwriting discount of 6.5% and payment of a 
discretionary incentive fee of 0.5% of the initial public offering price) and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us of approximately $13.4 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to repay $25.1 
million indebtedness outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit 
facilities, which will become due and payable upon the completion of this 
offering, and for general corporate purposes, including investments in 
technology. As of March 26, 2010, borrowings under our term loan totaled $10.0 
million at an interest rate of 8.625%, and borrowings under our revolving 
credit facility totaled $10.2 million at interest rates ranging from 5.0% to 
6.25%. Each of the foregoing term loan and revolving credit facility mature

completed. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire 
complementary businesses. 

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this 
offering as described above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of
funds may be necessary. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will 
depend upon numerous factors, including the progress of our development efforts
and our operating costs and expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in the expenditure of the net proceeds of this

offering to repay approximately $19 million of our term construction 
facility and $40 million of our unsecured term loan. We intend to use 
the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes, 
which may include acquisitions. 

Our term construction facility was incurred in connection with the 
construction of our headquarters in Calgary, which was completed in 
2009. It bears interest at a variable rate of 4.4% above Canadian 
dollar banker’s acceptance yields and matures on November 9, 2010.

as of March 31, 2010. 

Our unsecured term loan was incurred on August 28, 2007 to fund part 
of the consideration for the Corporate Reorganization paid to Intel 
and IFF. Interest on the unsecured term loan is deferred during the 
first four years and paid in cash thereafter. The unsecured term loan 
matures on August 28, 2015 and bears interest based on a formula that 
is substantially similar to the first lien facility term loan, except 
that the applicable margin is 8.50% for a Eurocurrency loan and 7.50%
for base rate loans. 

While we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this 
offering as described above, we may reallocate the net proceeds from 
time to time depending upon market conditions and other circumstances.
We may use a portion of the net proceeds for acquisitions of businesses 
or assets that we believe would advance our growth strategy, such as 
companies or businesses that develop or market products or services that 
complement our product offering. However, we currently have no agreements 
regarding any such acquisitions. Any such acquisition may require that 
we obtain additional financing.

to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, 
interest-bearing securities."

per common unit before expenses but after underwriting discounts and 
structuring fees.

$161 million demand note payable to ECA issued as consideration for the 
transfer of the Term Royalties thereto. The note held by ECA is payable by 
ECA’s subsidiary and is nonrecourse to the trust. As a result, the trust has 
no obligation to ECA on the note held by ECA. 
  
ECA intends to use the proceeds received from the repayment of the demand note 
by ECA’s subsidiary and from any exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option (a) to purchase 209,312 common units from the Private Investors at the 
initial public offering price, (b) to repay borrowings under its revolving and 
term credit facility and (c) for general corporate purposes, including the 
funding of the drilling obligation. As of June 28, 2010, the outstanding 
balance on the revolving credit facility, which matures on July 10, 2012, was 
approximately $132.1 million, and the weighted average interest rate of the 
revolving credit facility was 2.44%. Borrowings in the prior year were incurred
to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Please read “Certain 
transactions.” 
  
The table below sets forth ECA’s intended use of proceeds with the 
corresponding dollar amounts planned for such use. 
  
               
                                                              Intended Amount 
Intended Use                                              Dedicated to Such Use
   
Purchase of common units from the Private Investors            $    4.2 million
Repay borrowings under revolving credit facility               $  132.1 million
Repay borrowings under single advance term loan                $   24.0 million
General corporate purposes                                     $    0.7 million

The trust will use the net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option to repurchase an equal number of common units from ECA 
at the initial public offering price, after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions."

approximately $83.6 million, or approximately $98.6 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by 
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan 
to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

. approximately $20 million to $30 million to expand our data processing
  facilities and build a research and development center; 
 
. approximately $10 million to $20 million to fund the capital expenditure for
  our aerial photogrammetry business; and 
 
. the balance for general corporate purposes, including funding potential
  acquisitions of complementary businesses, although we are not currently
  negotiating any such transactions. 
 
The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering.
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus. 

Pending any use, as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits. 

In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we 
are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC 
subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to our variable 
interest entities only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable 
government registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company
loans to our PRC subsidiary or make additional capital contributions to our 
PRC subsidiary to fund its capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot 
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or 
approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling 
shareholders."

offering expenses of $3.35 million payable by us. If the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, our net proceeds will be 
approximately $26.73 million. We will contribute the net proceeds from this 
offering to our Operating Partnership in exchange for OP units. Our Operating 
Partnership intends to use the net proceeds from the offering (1) to acquire 
commercial properties in our target markets, (2) to acquire loans with the 
intent to acquire the underlying property through foreclosure or deed in lieu 
of foreclosure within a short period of time, (3) to redevelop and re-tenant 
existing properties to create Whitestone-branded Community Centered Properties

invest the net offering proceeds in interest-bearing, short-term, marketable 
investment grade securities or money market accounts that are consistent with 
our intention to qualify as a REIT."

this offering will be approximately $5.5 million, or approximately $6.4 million
if the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full. This estimate 
is based upon the initial public offering price of $4.00 per share, less 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable 
by us. 

The principal reasons for the offering are to provide our shareholders 
liquidity in the public equity market and to raise cash to support our growth 
plan. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to add employees to our 
Reimbursement, Patient Services and Administrative Departments; add members to 
our sales force and further develop our focus on institutional sales; continue 
our research and development efforts; and for general corporate purposes, 
including to finance equipment purchases and other capital expenditures in the 
ordinary course of business and to satisfy working capital needs. 

We may also use a portion of our net proceeds from this offering to reduce 
existing indebtedness under our credit facility with U.S. Bank, National 
Association (“U.S. Bank”), which we entered into in December 2009 for the 
purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for general corporate 
purposes. As of March 31, 2010, we had total outstanding debt of approximately 
$3,666,000 under the U.S. Bank credit facility, consisting of the following: 
approximately $1,268,000 principal balance under a revolving line of credit 
that bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% and is scheduled to mature on
November 30, 2010, if not renewed; approximately $894,000 principal balance 
under a term loan that bears interest at a rate of 4.28% and is scheduled to 
mature on December 9, 2012; and approximately $1,504,000 principal balance 
under a term loan that bears interest at a rate of 5.79% and is scheduled to 
mature on December 9, 2014. 

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions; however, 
proceeds will be used in management’s discretion, and there may be 
circumstances where a reallocation of funds is necessary. The amount and timing
of our actual expenditures depend on numerous contingencies, including the 
progress of our research and development activities, regulatory or competitive 
developments, and strategic opportunities. For example, in the event we 
identify opportunities that we believe are in the best interest of our 
shareholders, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to 
reinforce or broaden our product line, which may occur through the strategic 
acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, technologies, 
services, or products. We have no current plans, agreements or commitments with
respect to any such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently engaged
in any negotiations with respect to any such transaction. Pending the uses 
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in 
short- to medium-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

the sale of the ordinary shares offered by us will be approximately 
$52.5 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions

proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares by the selling shareholders. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering to 
expand our operations by acquiring or investing in strategic businesses

in enhancements to our technology, as well as for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes. At this time, we have not entered into any 
agreement or commitment with respect to any material acquisitions or

the net proceeds of this offering. 
  
Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest

$58.4 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares
of our common stock by the selling stockholders. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to pay accumulated 
and unpaid dividends on our outstanding shares of Series A, Series A1 and 
Series B convertible preferred stock that have accrued at a rate of 
8% per annum of the original issue price of each such share of preferred 
stock, compounded quarterly, of which the amount expected to be paid in 
cash is $0.4 million as of June 30, 2010, and to repay approximately 
$17.2 million of our indebtedness outstanding as of June 30, 2010.
As a result of the anticipated payment of accumulated and unpaid dividends 
on our Series A, Series A1 and Series B convertible preferred stock,

maturity of the earlier of either October 1, 2013 for notes issued 
December 31, 2008 or April 1, 2014 for notes issued April 23, 2010, 
immediately prior to this offering or immediately prior to our acquisition 
by another person or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. 
At June 30, 2010, we had $7.2 million of outstanding indebtedness under 
the unsecured subordinated promissory notes. These outstanding amounts 
bear interest at a per annum rate equal to 8.0%. Pursuant to the terms 
of our unsecured subordinated promissory notes, we will be required to 
repay the outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid 
interest under our unsecured subordinated promissory notes from the 
net proceeds from this offering. We expect this repayment to be 
approximately $7.2 million. 
  
The outstanding indebtedness under our secured promissory notes held 
by HV Capital Investors, L.L.C. has a stated maturity of August 1, 2013. 
At June 30, 2010, we had $10.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under 
two secured promissory notes in principal amount of $5.0 million each. 
These outstanding amounts bear interest at a per annum rate equal to 
13.75%, payable quarterly in arrears. We intend to use net proceeds 
of this offering to repay all indebtedness outstanding under one or 
both of our secured promissory notes. We expect this repayment to be 
approximately $10.0 million. 
  
We currently do not intend to prepay with the proceeds from this 
offering any additional outstanding indebtedness. 
  
The principal reasons for this offering are to establish a public market 
for our common stock, provide liquidity for our stockholders and 
facilitate our future access to public markets. Other than as described 
above, we do not have current specific plans for the use of a significant 
portion of the net proceeds from this offering. However, we generally

of, or investment in, businesses, products or technologies that enhance 
or add new services or additional functionality to our solutions, further 
solidify our market position or allow us to offer complementary products,

competitive position. Accordingly, our management will have broad

relying on the judgment of our management regarding their application.

The Sponsor will invest USCI’s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-
Related Investments, short-term Treasury Securities, cash and cash equivalents.
When USCI purchases Futures Contracts and certain Other Commodity-Related 
Investments that are exchange-traded, USCI will be required to deposit with the
futures commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of
the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation
under the Commodity Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial 
margin. Counterparties in transactions in over-the-counter Commodity Interests 
will generally impose similar collateral requirements on USCI. The Sponsor will
invest USCI’s assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in 
short-term Treasury Securities, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these 
margin and collateral requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine
the percentage of assets that will be: 

 •  held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other 
    custodians;  

 •  used for other investments; and  

 •  held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.  

In general, USCI expects that it will be required to post between 5% to 20% of

generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter Commodity 
Interests based on changes in the value of the Commodity Interests. 
Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter 
Commodity Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by 
overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the
ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Commodity Interest,
and each party’s creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for 
initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Commodity Interests
and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not
possible to estimate what portion of USCI’s assets will be posted as margin or 
collateral at any given time. The Treasury Securities, cash and cash 
equivalents held by USCI will constitute reserves that will be available to 
meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will be 
used for USCI’s benefit. 

A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to USCI to
hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security 
deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions 
held. 

USCI’s assets posted as margin for Futures Contracts will be held in

The Sponsor will invest USCI’s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-
Related Investments, short-term Treasury Securities, cash and cash equivalents.
When USCI purchases Futures Contracts and certain Other Commodity-Related 
Investments that are exchange-traded, USCI will be required to deposit with the
futures commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of
the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation
under the Commodity Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial 
margin. Counterparties in transactions in over-the-counter Commodity Interests 
will generally impose similar collateral requirements on USCI. The Sponsor will
invest USCI’s assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in 
short-term Treasury Securities, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these 
margin and collateral requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine
the percentage of assets that will be: 

 •  held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other 
    custodians;  

 •  used for other investments; and  

 •  held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.  

In general, USCI expects that it will be required to post between 5% to 20% of 
the notional amount of a Commodity Interest as initial margin when entering 
into such Commodity Interest. Ongoing margin and collateral payments will 
generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter Commodity 
Interests based on changes in the value of the Commodity Interests. 
Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter 
Commodity Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by 
overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the
ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Commodity Interest,
and each party’s creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for 
initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Commodity Interests
and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not
possible to estimate what portion of USCI’s assets will be posted as margin or 
collateral at any given time. The Treasury Securities, cash and cash 
equivalents held by USCI will constitute reserves that will be available to 
meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will be 
used for USCI’s benefit. 

A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to USCI to
hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security 
deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions 
held. 

USCI’s assets posted as margin for Futures Contracts will be held in 
segregation pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. 
Collateral posted in connection with over-the-counter contracts held with

in this offering will be approximately $130.2 million, or $150.2 million if 
the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option, based upon the 
initial public offering price of $13.00 per share, and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. 

We currently intend to use up to approximately $148.8 million of the net 
proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness, including related prepayment 
fees. In particular, we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this 
offering to first repay in full the PIK Loan, including related prepayment 
fees, under our Holdings Senior PIK Credit Agreement and then to repay, on a 
pro rata basis, a portion of the Tranche B and Tranche C term loans under our 
Second Lien Credit Agreement, with any remaining net proceeds to be used for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including capital 
expenditures and possible investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary 
businesses, services or technologies. As of March 31, 2010, we had $99.0 
million, $29.3 million and $35.0 million, outstanding under our PIK Loan, 
Tranche B term loan and Tranche C term loan, respectively. We have no current 
agreements or commitments with respect to any investment or acquisition and 
we currently are not engaged in negotiations with respect to any investment 
or acquisition. 

The PIK Loan under our Holdings Senior PIK Credit Agreement is due and payable 
in full on June 15, 2015. The interest rate on the PIK Loan is 13% per annum 
and the PIK Loan provides for a prepayment penalty of 4%. The Tranche B and 
Tranche C term loans under our Second Lien Credit Agreement mature on December 
15, 2014. The Tranche B term loan under the Second Lien Credit Agreement bears 
interest at 11% per annum. The Tranche C term loan bears interest at the 
Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 5.75% per annum, 
which was 5.98% at March 31, 2010. Following this offering, the Eurodollar 
Rate on the Tranche C term loan will be subject to a floor of 2.0% per annum 
and the rate margin on the Eurodollar Rate will increase from 5.75% 
to 6.50%. 

In addition, except for the amounts used to repay our outstanding 
indebtedness, the amount of what, and timing of when, we actually spend for 
these purposes may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, 
including our future revenue and cash generated by operations and the other 
factors described under “Risk Factors” in this prospectus. Accordingly, our 
management will have broad discretion in applying a portion of the net 
proceeds of this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in high quality, investment grade, short-term fixed income 
instruments which include corporate, financial institution, federal agency 
or U.S. government obligations."

from the sale of 34,000,000 shares of our common stock in this offering, after 
deducting $24 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses of $10 million payable by us.

We currently intend to use the proceeds from this offering, net of underwriting 
fees and other offering expenses, to repay a portion of our long-term 
indebtedness, which consists of our euro-denominated 10% super priority notes 
due July 15, 2013, U.S. dollar-denominated 10% super priority notes due July 
15, 2013, euro-denominated floating rate senior secured notes due October 15,
2013 U.S. dollar-denominated floating rate senior secured notes due October
15, 2013, U.S. dollar-denominated 7   7 / 8 % senior secured notes due 
October 15, 2014, euro-denominated 8   5 / 8 % senior notes due October 15, 
2015 and U.S. dollar-denominated 9  1 / 2 % senior notes due October 15,
2015. The selection of which series of notes, the amounts to be repaid within
a particular series, the timing of repayment and the particular method by
which we effect repayment, which could include redemption calls, open market 
purchases, privately negotiated transactions or tender offers, or some 
combination thereof, have not yet been determined and will depend on, with 
respect to each series of notes, the yield to maturity at the time of 
repayment, the maturity date, the contractual redemption price and the 
currency exchange rates. We will consider each of these criteria with respect 
to each series of notes at any time of repayment.

As of July 5, 2010, the weighted average interest rate to maturity of our 
euro-denominated floating rate senior secured notes due October 15, 2013, 
was 3.39%. As of July 5, 2010, the weighted average interest rate to maturity
of our U.S. dollar-denominated floating rate senior secured notes due October
15, 2013 was 3.05%.

Certain underwriters or their affiliates are holders of certain of our 
existing notes. As a result, some of the underwriters or their affiliates 
may receive part of the net proceeds of this offering by reason of the 
repayment of our indebtedness. In light of the amount of existing notes held,
none of the underwriters and their respective affiliates are expected to 
receive 5% or more of the expected net proceeds of the offering, other than 
affiliates of KKR Capital Markets LLC. Assuming that we apply the proceeds 
from this offering to repay a pro rata portion of each series of existing 
notes other than the New Secured Notes, affiliates of KKR Capital Markets 
LLC would receive approximately 4.3% of the expected net proceeds."

shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $43.2 million,
assuming an initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, after 
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds from 
this offering will be approximately $50.2 million. 
  
Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering 
price of $10.00 per share would increase or decrease the net proceeds to 
us from this offering by approximately $4.6 million, assuming that the 
number of shares of common stock offered by us, as set forth on the cover 
page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
payable by us. 
  
We anticipate using the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 
  
• Approximately $36.0 million to complete the clinical development of,
  seek marketing approval for, initiate the commercial manufacture of and,
  if approved, commercially launch Zelrix in the U.S.;  
   
• Approximately $5.0 million to continue preclinical and clinical
  development of NP201 and NP202; and  
   
• The balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
  which may include the acquisition or licensing of other products or
  technologies or the acquisition of other businesses in the biotechnology
  or specialty pharmaceuticals industry.  

This anticipated use of net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. 
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly 
depending on numerous factors, including: the timing of our NDA submission 
to the FDA for Zelrix; the extent to which the FDA may require us to 
perform additional clinical trials for Zelrix; the costs of our 
commercialization activities for Zelrix, if it is approved by the FDA; 
the cost, timing and outcome of the development of our other product 
candidates; the extent to which we acquire or invest in products, 
businesses and technologies; the extent to which we establish collaboration 
or other similar agreements; the cost of preparing and prosecuting patent 
applications and enforcing and defending intellectual property claims; 
and any unforeseen or underestimated cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net 
proceeds from this offering. In addition, our anticipated use of proceeds 
does not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, 
dispositions, joint ventures or investments that we may make. We have no 
current understandings, agreements or commitments for any material 
acquisitions or licenses of any products, businesses or technologies. 
  
Following this offering, we believe that our available funds will be 
sufficient to complete the development of Zelrix through FDA approval 
and to fund the expected commercial launch of Zelrix in the U.S. in the 
first half of 2012. It is possible that we will not achieve the progress 
that we expect with respect to Zelrix because the actual costs and timing 
of development and marketing approval are difficult to predict and are 
subject to substantial risks and delays. We have no committed external 
sources of funds. To the extent that the net proceeds from this offering 
and our other capital resources are insufficient to complete clinical 
development of, obtain marketing approval for and, if approved, 
commercially launch Zelrix, we will need to finance our cash needs 
through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate 
collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives. 
  
Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments,

approximately $29.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the 
selling stockholders, including any shares sold by the selling stockholders 
in connection with the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase 
additional shares. 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for 
the following purposes and in the following amounts: 

• Approximately $7.5 million of the net proceeds to us from this offering
  will be used to pay a termination fee to affiliates of Sun Capital for
  termination of the consulting agreement with them 
 
• Approximately $16.0 million of the net proceeds to us from this offering
  will be used to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility,
  which bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin
  and is scheduled to expire on February 20, 2013. Such borrowings were
  used primarily to pay a portion of the $20 million special dividend that
  we issued in June 2010. 
 
• The remaining net proceeds to us from this offering will be used for
  working capital and general corporate purposes, including the payment
  of bonus agreements with certain of our executive officers. We do not have
  any specific plans with respect to this portion of the net proceeds.
  Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application
  of these proceeds. We believe that retaining these net proceeds will
  afford us significant flexibility to pursue our business strategies,
  including our planned growth through new store openings."

US$64.59 million, at the initial public offering price of US$10.00 per ADS, 
and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately US$79.48 million. We will not receive any of the proceeds from 
the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders.

We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering to fund 
working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including the 
expansion of our different lines of business. The principal reasons we are 
conducting this offering are to be able to access public markets in the 
United States and to raise funds for our general corporate purposes and 
finance our future expansion, which we expect will include business expansion 
including strategic acquisitions, upgrades and expansions to our schools and 
learning centers, teacher training programs and research and development of 
our educational content and to fund our working capital. We currently 
estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 
US$20 million for working capital and general corporate purposes, including 
teaching training programs and for research and development of our 
educational content and the balance for the expansion of our business. Of 
the proceeds we expect to use for the expansion of our business, we 
currently anticipate that US$30 to US$40 million would be used for strategic
acquisitions with the remainder to be used for upgrades and expansions to 
our existing schools and learning centers. For a further discussion of our 
strategies and business plan.

We do not currently have any agreements or understandings to make any 
material acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses but, as of
the date of this prospectus, Ambow Sihua and Ambow Shanghai have entered 
into exclusivity agreements with five career enhancement centers and two 
tutoring centers with whom we may commence acquisition discussions after 
this offering is completed. To the extent that the net proceeds from this 
offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to 
invest our net proceeds in interest-bearing bank deposits that may be
withdrawn upon demand, short-term interest-bearing, investment grade 
securities, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed government 
obligations.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, 
we are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our 
PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to other 
entities only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government 
registration and approval requirements, we may extend intercompany loans to
our PRC subsidiaries and affiliated entities or make additional capital 
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or 
working capital. We expect to apply and obtain such approval and registration
as we deem necessary for utilizing the proceeds of this offering to provide 
funding to our PRC subsidiaries or other entities through capital 
contribution and loans. We have successfully obtained government approvals 
and registrations for our capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. We 
did not make any intercompany loans to Ambow Online. We have not obtained 
governmental approvals or registrations for intercompany loans to our VIEs 
or their subsidiaries because there are no approval or registration 
requirements for these loans. We cannot assure you that we will be able to 
obtain these government approvals or registrations if and when needed on 
a timely basis, if at all. The time associated with these activities is 
usually several months and the related cost is minimal. For an increase of 
registered capital of the wholly-owned foreign enterprise, the authority will
decide within 30 days after receiving the application documents. After 
obtaining the approval from authorities in charge of foreign investment, the 
time for the wholly-owned foreign enterprise’s registration of such capital 
contributions with SAFE will generally be less than 20 business days.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering.
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus."

ordinary shares in this offering will be approximately US$9,391 thousand, at 
an assumed public offering price of US$8.00 per ordinary share, the midpoint 
of the range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, after deducting the 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. Each US$1.00 increase in the assumed public offering 
price of US$8.00 per ordinary share would increase or decrease, as applicable, 
the net proceeds to us by approximately US$1,375 thousand, assuming the number 
of ordinary shares offered by us as set forth on the cover of this prospectus 
remains the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions payable by us. If the underwriter exercises its over-allotment 
option in full, we estimate that we will receive additional net proceeds of 
approximately US$1,650 thousand, after deducting the estimated underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use approximately US$2,000 thousand of the net proceeds that we 
will receive from this offering to expand our sales and marketing operations; 
approximately US$4,000 thousand to expand our manufacturing capabilities; 
approximately US$2,000 thousand to finalize the research, development and 
commercialization of our Nilipatch insulin pump and approximately US$1,391 
thousand for working capital and general corporate purposes. We also may use a 
portion of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in, or acquisitions 
of, complementary businesses, products or technologies. We have no current 
agreements or commitments with respect to any investment or acquisition, and 
we are not engaged in negotiations with respect to any investment or 
acquisition. Pending their ultimate use, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
to us from this offering in U.S. government securities and Israeli government 
securities. We cannot predict whether the net proceeds from such investments 
will produce a favorable return. 

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from 
our current expectations and will depend on a number of factors, including our 
future revenues and cash generated by operations and other factors. Therefore, 
we will have broad discretion in the way we use the net proceeds from this 
offering."

underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares, we 
estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $49.1
million. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to 
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use 
the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

  •   Approximately $37.1 million to fund clinical and nonclinical research 
      and development costs for torezolid phosphate for the treatment of 
      ABSSSI and other indications; and
  
  •   The remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
 
We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and 
cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund 
our operations through mid-2012. 

In particular, we believe that the approximate $37.1 million of the net 
proceeds from this offering intended for research and development and our 
existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be 
sufficient to fund the continued development of torezolid phosphate through 
the following events: 

 •   Receipt of top-line data from our first Phase 3 clinical trial of the 
     oral dosage form of torezolid phosphate for the treatment of ABSSSI; 
 
 •   Initiation of our Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of CABP, HAP 
     and VAP; 
 
  .  Initiation of our preclinical studies for the treatment of osteomyelitis; 
     and 
 

  •  Initiation of the clinical safety and special population clinical trials 
     which the FDA has indicated will be necessary for registration of 
     torezolid phosphate. 
 

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade 
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of 
the United States government."

of 3,244,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting the 
underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us, and a related 
capital contribution by our general partner of approximately $10.4 million to 
maintain its 2.0% general partner interest in us. 

We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this offering and the related 
capital contribution by our general partner to repay indebtedness outstanding 
under our credit agreement, which was incurred for working capital needs and 
the acquisitions of coal properties and mining equipment. We may reborrow any 
amounts repaid under our credit agreement. Upon application of the net proceeds
from this offering and the related capital contribution by our general partner,
we will have approximately $32.7 million of indebtedness outstanding under our 
credit agreement. 

On June 30, 2010, we amended our credit agreement. References to our credit 
agreement refer to the credit agreement as amended. Our credit agreement bears 
interest at either (1) LIBOR plus 3.0% to 3.5% per annum, depending on our 
leverage ratio, or (2) a base rate that is the sum of (i) the higher of (a) the
prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (c) LIBOR plus 1.0% and 
(ii) 1.5% to 2.0% per annum, depending on our leverage ratio. We incur letter 
of credit fees equal to the then applicable spread above LIBOR on the undrawn 
face amount of standby letters of credit issued and a 15 basis point fronting 
fee payable to the administrative agent on the aggregate face amount of such 
letters of credit. In addition, we incur a commitment fee on the unused portion
of the credit agreement at a rate of 0.5% per annum based on the unused portion
of the facility. The credit agreement will mature in February 2013.

The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 
additional common units (approximately $9.3 million, if exercised in full, 
after deducting the underwriting discount) will be used to reimburse Wexford 
for capital expenditures incurred with respect to the assets contributed to us.
If the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional common 
units, we will issue 486,600 common units to Rhino Energy Holdings LLC at the 
expiration of the option period. If and to the extent the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional common units, the number of units purchased
by the underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and 
the remainder, if any, will be issued to Rhino Energy Holdings LLC. 
Accordingly, the exercise of the underwriters' option will not affect the total
number of units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum 
quarterly distribution on all units. 

Affiliates of Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and RBC Capital Markets 
Corporation are lenders under our credit agreement and will receive their pro 
rata portion of the net proceeds from this offering and the related capital 
contribution by our general partner through the repayment of borrowings they 
have extended under the credit agreement."

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for capital expenditures, 
working capital and general corporate purposes, including building engineering 
services capabilities to support sugar and ethanol mill conversion to integrate
our technology and growing our chemistry capabilities to accelerate development
of our chemical products. With regard to capital expenditures, we will bear the
construction costs of Phase I of the facility to be completed under our joint 
venture agreements with Usina São Martinho, and Usina São Martinho will be 
required to reimburse us for a portion of these costs after commencement of 
commercial operations. We and Usina São Martinho will jointly fund the 
construction of Phase II of this facility, subject to certain limitations on 
Usina São Martinho’s funding requirements. We expect to enter into agreements 
with owners of other sugar and ethanol mills for the construction of bolt-on 
facilities for the production of our products, and we anticipate that we will 
agree to fund a portion of these construction costs. The amount of our capital 
expenditures for future production facilities will be a function of the number 
of such facilities that we undertake to develop and the terms of our agreements
with the mill owners related to the financing of these construction costs. We 
also anticipate that our capital expenditures will include expenditures for 
capital equipment purchases associated with contract manufacturing 
arrangements. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to expand our 
business through acquisitions of other companies, assets or technologies. 
However, at this time, we do not have any commitment to any specific 
acquisitions.

Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public 
market for our common stock, increase our visibility in the marketplace and 
provide liquidity to existing stockholders. A public market for our common 
stock will facilitate future access to public equity markets and enhance our 
ability to sell our common stock as a means of attracting and retaining key 
employees and as consideration for acquisitions.

We will have broad discretion in the way that we use the net proceeds of this 
offering. The amounts that we actually spend for the purposes described above 
may vary significantly and will depend, in part, on the timing and amount of 
our future revenues, our future expenses and any potential acquisitions that 
we may propose. Pending the uses of the net proceeds of this offering, as 
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade, 
interest-bearing securities."

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of 
approximately $75.5 million, or approximately $80.3 million if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, and 
assuming an initial public offering price of $9.00 per ADS, which is the mid-
point of the estimated public offering price range set forth on the front cover
of this prospectus. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares, retain talented employees by providing them with equity incentives and 
obtain additional capital. We intend to use the net proceeds we will receive 
from this offering as follows: 

   •  approximately $15.0 million to enhance our e-commerce infrastructure 
      primarily through MecoxLane Information, one of our VIEs, and Mai Wang 
      Information, one of our PRC subsidiaries. We plan to improve our 
      management information system software and our e-commerce website and 
      upgrade our hardware such as servers and computers from 2010 to 2012; 
 
   •  approximately $29.5 million to build part of a new logistics center and 
      warehouse primarily through Mecox Lane Technology (China) Limited, or 
      MecoxLane Technology, one of our PRC subsidiaries. We have a plan to 
      build a new logistics center in Jiangsu Province with an area of 
      approximately 200,000 square meters. The first stage of approximately 
      100,000 square meters will be completed by the end of 2012; 
 
   •  approximately $6.5 million for store growth and improvement primarily 
      through MecoxLane Shopping and Rampage Shopping, two of our VIEs. We 
      intend to use part of this $6.5 million to open an additional 
      approximately five directly operated stores and approximately 20 
      franchised stores in 2010. The remaining portion of this $6.5 million 
      will be used to improve our existing stores and to open additional stores
      in future years; and 
 
   •  the remaining proceeds for working capital and other corporate purposes, 
      including procuring products to diversify our merchandise offerings 
      primarily through Mai Wang Trading and Rampage Trading, two of our PRC 
      subsidiaries, enhancing our online advertising efforts primarily through 
      MecoxLane Information, one of our VIEs, and recruiting additional 
      employees to expand our design and product management teams. 
 
We plan to transfer a majority of the net proceeds to our PRC subsidiaries by 
contributing to their registered capital or providing shareholder loans. We 
plan to transfer the remaining net proceeds to our VIEs by providing loans to 
the shareholders of the VIEs under new contractual arrangements. These 
shareholders of VIEs will then transfer such amounts to the VIEs by increasing 
the registered capital of these VIEs. We have not entered into any agreement 
for the above shareholder loans or any new contractual arrangements to transfer
the net proceeds to our VIEs. 

We believe the proceeds from this offering will provide sufficient capital to 
our expansion plans above mentioned. The foregoing represents our current 
intentions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering based upon our
present plans and business conditions. Our management, however, will have 
significant flexibility and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this 
offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may 
use the proceeds of this offering differently than as described in this 
prospectus. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand 
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling 
shareholders."

offering will be approximately $42.2 million, or $48.8 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based on the initial
public offering price of $9.50 per share and after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

We estimate that we will use approximately $3.0 million of the net proceeds we 
receive in this offering to repay debt, including accrued interest, 
outstanding under our loan and security agreement with Hercules. As of June 30,
2010, we had outstanding approximately $4.0 million in aggregate principal 
amount under this loan and security agreement, bearing interest at the greater 
of 11.0% or the prime lending rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal , 
plus 2.5% per annum, maturing in September 2011. We entered into this loan and 
security agreement in March 2007, amended the terms in September 2008, July 
2009, January 2010, June 2010 and October 2010, and have used the proceeds of 
this indebtedness for working capital purposes. 

We estimate that we will use the remaining proceeds of this offering follows: 

   •     approximately $35.0 million to fund our ongoing pivotal Phase III 
         clinical trial of lomitapide for the treatment of patients with HoFH 
         and related development work, submission of applications for marketing
         approval and commercial launch of lomitapide for this indication; 
 
   •     approximately $4.0 million to advance the clinical development of 
         lomitapide for the treatment of patients with FC; and 
 
   •     any remainder to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other 
         general corporate purposes. 
 
We have no current understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to 
any material acquisition of or investment in any technologies, products or 
companies. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the 
particular uses for the proceeds from this offering, or the amounts that we 
will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our 
actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the progress 
of our development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results 
from our clinical trials, whether or not we enter into strategic collaborations
or partnerships, and our operating costs and expenditures. Accordingly, our 
management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of 
this offering. 

The costs and timing of drug development and marketing approval, particularly 
conducting clinical trials, are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial 
risks and can often change. Accordingly, we may change the allocation of use 
of these proceeds as a result of contingencies such as the progress and 
results of our clinical trials and other development activities, the 
establishment of collaborations, our manufacturing requirements and regulatory 
or competitive developments. 

Based on our current operating plans, we anticipate that the net proceeds of 
this offering, together with our existing resources, will be sufficient to 
enable us to maintain our currently planned operations, including our continued
product candidate development, at least through the next 24 months. We believe 
that these available funds will allow us to complete our ongoing pivotal Phase 
III clinical trial of, seek marketing approval for and commercially launch 
lomitapide for the treatment of patients with HoFH. In addition, we believe 
that these available funds will allow us to initiate a Phase II/III clinical 
trial of lomitapide for the treatment of patients with FC. However, we may 
require additional funds in order to complete our planned clinical trial of 
lomitapide for the treatment of patients with FC or to conduct additional 
clinical trials or seek marketing approval of lomitapide. We may seek these
funds through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt 
financings and collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. 
Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be 
available on terms that are favorable to us. If adequate funds are not 
available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to terminate 
or delay clinical trials or other development activities for lomitapide for 
one or more indications for which we are developing lomitapide, in particular 
any clinical trial we initiate for the treatment of patients with FC, or delay
our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that 
may be necessary to commercialize lomitapide, if we obtain marketing approval. 
Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development and 
commercialization of lomitapide, we are unable to estimate the amounts of 
additional funds we may require in connection with our planned clinical trial 
of lomitapide for the treatment of patients with FC or our future anticipated 
clinical trials or to achieve FDA approval and commercial introduction of 
lomitapide. 

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

       existing senior credit facilities. An affiliate of Jefferies & Company, 
       Inc. is also a lender under our existing senior credit facilities, 
       although it will receive less than 5% of the proceeds from this offering
       (after taking into account underwriters’ discounts and commissions and 
       offering expenses payable by us).  
   
   •   To repay all of our 13.25% senior subordinated secured notes, and any 
       accrued and unpaid interest. As of June 27, 2010, approximately $32.4 
       million aggregate principal amount of our 13.25% senior subordinated 
       secured notes were outstanding. Interest on our 13.25% senior 
       subordinated secured notes is payable monthly at an annual interest rate
       of 13.25%, with the principal due on December 29, 2012. Pursuant to the 
       note purchase agreement governing the 13.25% senior subordinated secured
       notes, we were entitled to elect monthly during the first year to accrue
       interest at the rate of 14.25% per annum with no payments. Commencing in

       date, we have the option to accrue interest at an annual rate of 13.25%,

   •    $30.0 million to pay a declared dividend conditional upon the 
        completion of this offering;  
   
   •    approximately $10.0 million to improve our existing facilities; and  
   
   •    the balance for general corporate purposes, including strategic 
        investments in and acquisitions of complementary businesses, although 
        we have not identified any near-term investment or acquisition targets.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. 
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus. To the extent that a certain 
portion or all of the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not 
immediately applied for the above purposes, we plan to invest the net proceeds 
in short-term interest-bearing debt instruments or bank deposits. 
  
In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we are 
permitted, under the PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC 
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our PRC 
affiliated entities only through loans, subject to satisfaction of applicable 
government registration and approval requirements. There are no costs 
associated with registering loans or capital contributions with relevant PRC 
authorities, other than nominal processing charges. Under PRC laws and 
regulations, the PRC governmental authorities are required to process such 
approvals or registrations or deny our application within a prescribed period 
which is usually less than 90 days. The actual time taken, however, may be 
longer due to administrative delay. We cannot assure you that we will be able 
to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at 
all."

approximately $41.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and 
the estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the ADSs sold by the selling shareholders. 

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

   •     approximately $15.0 million for the construction of our manufacturing 
         facility and laboratory services building in Fengxian, Shanghai; 

   •     approximately $15.0 million for the purchase of equipment; 
 
   •     approximately $5.0 million for the expansion of our service offerings;
  
   •     approximately $5.0 million for working capital needs; and

Pending any use of the net proceeds, as described above, we plan to invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments or bank deposits.
These investments may materially and adversely affect the U.S. federal income 
tax consequences of your investment in our ADSs. In particular, it is possible 
that we may become a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes, which could result in negative tax consequences for you.

are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC

satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, 
we may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiaries or make additional 
capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital 
expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to 
obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

approximately $21.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses that we must pay. We will not 
receive any of the net proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling 
stockholders. 

We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay 
outstanding borrowings under our new credit facility. On September 24, 2010, 
we borrowed $58.5 million under our new credit facility and used all of the 
funds to repay in full the amounts owed under our old term loan facility. The 
new credit facility has a maturity in September 2015. The outstanding 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest, at our election, 
as either base rate (Base Rate) or Eurodollar loans: 

• Eurodollar loans will bear interest at the adjusted LIBOR for the interest 
  period in effect for such borrowings plus a spread of 2.50% to 3.25% based 
  on our leverage ratio. 

• Base Rate loans will bear interest at the base rate plus a spread of 1.50% 
  to 2.25% based on our leverage ratio. 

We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes, including to fund working capital. We may also use a portion of 
the net proceeds to expand our current business through strategic alliances 
involving, or acquisitions of, other assets or businesses that are 
complementary to ours. However, we have no current plans, agreements or 
commitments and are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to 
any such transaction. Pending use of the net proceeds, as described above, we 
plan to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation 
investments, including investment-grade, short-term, interest-bearing 
securities. 

This expected use of the net proceeds of this offering represents our 
current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. 
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of 
our business."
BODY CENTRAL CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/body-central-corp-724565-64655,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/body-central-corp-724565-64655,424B4,10/15/2010,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7504357,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of 
approximately $37.8 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The selling 
stockholders have granted to the underwriters an option to purchase up to an 
additional 750,000 shares of common stock, on a pro rata basis. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the 
selling stockholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering principally as 
follows: 

• approximately $32.8 million (as of July 3, 2010) (from the sale by us of 
  approximately 2,520,616 shares of our common stock in this offering) to 
  repay all outstanding amounts under our term loan facilities of our senior 
  credit facility and pay down any outstanding amounts under our revolving 
  credit facility of our senior credit facility; 


• approximately $3.5 million (as of July 3, 2010) (from the sale by us of 
  approximately 268,770 shares of our common stock in this offering) to redeem 
  all outstanding shares of our non-convertible, non-voting Series C preferred 
  stock; 


• the payment by us of up to an aggregate of $1.0 million (from the sale by us 
  of approximately 76,924 shares of our common stock in this offering) to 
  specified employees, including certain named executive officers, under a 
  success bonus plan triggered upon completion of this offering 


• approximately $0.5 million (from the sale by us of approximately 41,382 
  shares of our common stock in this offering) to provide funds for working 
  capital and other general corporate purposes, including to grow our store 
  base and our direct business, to convert Body Shop stores to Body Central 
  banners, to refurbish older stores, to make technology improvements and to 
  make other capital expenditures. While we have not yet determined the 
  approximate dollar amounts allocated to these general corporate purposes, we 
  believe that retaining these net proceeds will afford us significant 
  flexibility to pursue our business strategies, including our planned growth 
  strategy through new store openings. 

We are conducting this offering at this time in order to (1) raise working 
capital to fund our planned growth strategy and to repay outstanding debt and 
deleverage the company, (2) to raise our public profile and (3) to create a 
public market for our common stock for the benefit of our current stockholders 
and facilitate our future access to public markets. 

In March 2007, we issued 30,000 shares of our non-convertible, non-voting 
Series C preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of $3.0 million to 
the sellers of shares of Body Shop of America, Inc. and Catalogue Ventures, 
Inc. in the 2006 Transaction. The purchase price was paid for the Series C 
preferred stock from the escrow account securing certain indemnification
obligations of the sellers in connection with the 2006 Transaction. The shares 
of our Series C preferred stock have a preference upon liquidation of $100 per 
share. The holders of our Series C preferred stock are entitled to receive 
dividends at an annual rate of 5% accruing quarterly beginning on the date 
of issuance. The shares of our Series C preferred stock are subject to 
redemption rights at the election of the holders and at our election in 
certain circumstances. These redemption rights are subject to, among other 
things, restrictions under our senior credit facility. Upon completion of 
this offering, we expect to redeem all issued Series C preferred stock for
$3.0 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends of approximately $494,000 as 
of July 3, 2010. 

As of July 3, 2010, we had an aggregate of $32.8 million of borrowings 
outstanding under our senior credit facility, consisting of two term loan 
facilities and a revolving credit facility. Our senior credit facility 
provides for a $24.0 million term loan B facility, with quarterly interest 
payments and a maturity date of October 1, 2013, a $27.5 million term loan 
A facility, with quarterly principal and interest payments and a maturity 
date of October 1, 2012 and a revolving credit facility that provides for 
advances up to $15.0 million, subject to certain limitations, and a maturity 
date of October 1, 2012. Immediately prior to the completion of this offering, 
we anticipate the outstanding term loan borrowings (both the term loan A 
facility and term loan B facility) under our senior credit facility will
be approximately $31.5 million in the aggregate. We currently do not have 
any borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and do not 
expect to draw down any amounts under this facility prior to completion of 
this offering. Accordingly, we anticipate that there will be no amounts 
outstanding under our revolving credit facility to repay upon completion 
of this offering. Following this offering, our term loan facilities will 
be repaid in full and our senior credit facility will terminate. Following 
completion of this offering, we expect to negotiate for a new revolving 
credit facility. Both the term loan facilities and the revolving credit 
facility are collateralized by substantially all our assets, including 
pledges of the stock of our operating subsidiaries. Borrowings under our 
revolving credit facility and our term loan A facility bear interest, at 
our option, at either LIBOR plus a margin of 5.25% per annum or an alternative 
base rate (defined as the greatest of (i) 5.25%, (ii) the rate of interest 
publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank from time to time as its base rate 
and (iii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%) plus a margin of 3.75%. Borrowings 
under our term loan B facility bear interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus a 
margin of 5.75% per annum or the alternative base rate referenced above plus 
a margin of 4.25% per annum. Borrowings under our letters of credit bear 
interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 5.25% per annum. The weighted average 
interest rate under our senior credit facility for the twenty-six weeks 
ended July 3, 2010 was approximately 8.82%."

approximately $70.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and 
estimated expenses of this offering. Our June 30, 2010 consolidated balance 
sheet gives effect to our payment at or prior to June 30, 2010 of $2.5 million
of the expenses relating to this offering.

We intend to use $53.5 million of the proceeds from this offering to reduce
the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and the balance of 
such proceeds plus $3 million of our cash to reduce other indebtedness and to 
pay expenses of this offering not paid as of June 30, 2010. The amount 
outstanding under our revolving credit facility varies frequently and at the 
closing of this offering may be less than or greater than the balance 
reflected in this prospectus as outstanding at June 30, 2010. To the extent 
that such proceeds from this offering exceed the amount outstanding on our 
revolving credit facility, we intend to apply such remaining proceeds to 
reduce outstanding indebtedness under any one or more of: our foreign 
subsidiary indebtedness, the notes or our capital leases. The precise amount 
of debt reduction with respect to any specific type of indebtedness has not 
yet been determined, as such determination will depend primarily upon market 
conditions at the time this offering is consummated. Pending application of 
the net proceeds to repay indebtedness, we intend to invest the net proceeds
in short term investments.

At June 30, 2010, the weighted average interest rate in effect on our 
revolving credit facility was 2.6%. Such indebtedness matures on July 31, 
2012. For a description of the interest rates and the maturity dates with 
respect to our foreign subsidiary indebtedness and the notes.

Contemporaneous with the closing of this offering, we will pay a total of 
$1.2 million to certain executive officers pursuant to a special incentive
program. In addition, we expect to grant RSUs to our executive officers, 
a board member and a consultant and to grant stock options to our executive 
officers and other employees. Such RSUs and stock options are subject to 
vesting requirements. See footnote 2 in “Prospectus Summary—Summary 
Consolidated Financial Data.” We have agreed to establish a bonus pool for 
certain employees who are not executive officers pursuant to our Value 
Creation Plan. However, based upon the size of this offering and the initial
public offering price of $13.00 per share, we will not pay any benefits under 
that plan."

$375.7 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full.
  
We will contribute the net proceeds from this offering to our operating 
partnership. Assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option, 
we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and approximately $45.2 
million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as follows: 
  
   •  approximately $287.1 million to reduce outstanding mortgage and 
      construction loan indebtedness and pay associated costs, as follows:

      rate floor through October 31, 2010 with respect to approximately $136.4
      million), a maturity date of January 31, 2011 and an additional loan 
      extension fee of $1.3 million);  
   
   •  $14.9 million outstanding under our construction loan with Wachovia Bank
      as it relates to The Grove at San Marcos (this loan, or the Wachovia 
      Bank Three Property Construction Loan, is secured by three of our 
      properties and has an aggregate outstanding principal amount of 
      approximately $14.9 million, as of June 30, 2010, an interest rate of

      rate swaps and hedges relating to the repayment of this debt (based on 
      the settlement value as of June 30, 2010);  

   •  approximately $4.8 million to fund preferred investments in asset-owning
      entities that will use the net proceeds from such investments to reduce 
      the outstanding principal balance of the Wachovia Bank Three Property 
      Construction Loan that is secured, in part, by The Grove at San Marcos, 
      in connection with our purchase of The Grove at San Marcos and its 
      removal from the collateral pool securing such loan;  

   •  approximately $4.0 million to repay indebtedness owed to Capital Bank, 
      which has an interest rate of prime plus 1.0% and a maturity date of 
      October 15, 2010 with a commitment from the lender to extend the maturity
      date to November 5, 2010;  
   
   •  approximately $6.0 million to repay unsecured indebtedness owed by us to 
      RHR, LLC, an entity owned by MXT Capital and the Ricker Group, which has
      an interest rate of 12% and a maturity date of April 30, 2011; RHR, LLC 
      will, in turn, immediately repay an equal amount of indebtedness owed by
      it to an unaffiliated third party on substantially the same terms and 
      conditions as the loan from RHR, LLC to us;  
   
   •  approximately $3.3 million to MXT Capital, which will immediately use 
      such amount to make capital contributions to certain entities that will,
      in turn, immediately use the capital contributions solely to repay 
      indebtedness;  
   
   •  approximately $24.0 million to acquire interests in our properties from 
      HSRE;  
   
   •  approximately $17.4 million to acquire interests in our properties from 
      the Ricker Group;  
   
   •  approximately $10.7 million to acquire interests in our properties from 
      certain third-party investors;   
   
   •  approximately $3.4 million to acquire land on which we expect to 
      commence building four properties following the completion of this 
      offering;  
   
   •  $3.9 million to acquire the preferred membership interest in CC-Encore 
      (which includes repayment of the $2.35 million loan from CC-Encore to 
      Campus Crest Ventures I, LLC, or “CCV I”); and  
   
   •  approximately $6.4 million for working capital and general corporate 
      purposes.  

Under certain circumstances, we have the option to cause Encore to purchase an
additional preferred membership interest in CC-Encore in an amount not to 
exceed $2.5 million. We have not exercised this option, we have no intent to 
exercise this option and our right to cause Encore to purchase an additional 
preferred membership interest, as well as CC-Encore itself, will be terminated 
upon completion of this offering and our repurchase of the currently 
outstanding preferred interest. However, to the extent we did exercise this 
option and Encore purchased an additional $2.5 million preferred interest, we 
would be obligated to purchase this additional interest for approximately $3.75
million upon completion of this offering. We would use a portion of the net 
proceeds to complete this purchase, which would reduce the amount of net 
proceeds available for working capital and general corporate purposes by $3.75
million. 
  
If the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised, we expect to use the 
additional net proceeds (which, if the underwriters’ overallotment is exercised
in full, will be approximately $49.9 million) to pay down borrowings under our 
revolving credit facility and for working capital and general corporate 
purposes, which may include funding a portion of our expected development 
activity and other growth strategies and distributions to our stockholders. 

Pending application of any portion of the net proceeds from this offering, we 
will invest it in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing 
securities as is consistent with our intention to qualify for taxation as a 
REIT for federal income tax purposes. Such investments may include, for 
example, obligations of the U.S. federal government and governmental agency 
securities, certificates of deposit and interest-bearing bank deposits.

uses of the proceeds from this offering (assuming the underwriters’ 
overallotment option is not exercised) and borrowings under our revolving 
credit facility.

(1)   Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem 
their shares in connection with our successful consummation of our initial 
business combination.  
   
(2)   In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the 
proceeds of a $225,000 loan from Mr. Hicks, as described in this prospectus. 
This loan will be repaid upon consummation of this offering  
out of the $1.75 million of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the 
payment of offering expenses. In the event that offering expenses are less 
than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing 
working capital expenses.  
   
(3)   We have engaged The Klein Group to provide advisory services in 
connection with this offering and our initial business combination. The Klein 
Group will receive $100,000 upon the consummation of the offering and 
reimbursement of up to $15,000 of expenses. The Klein Group will also receive 
$300,000 upon the closing of our initial business combination.  

(4)   The underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $4.5 million of 
their underwriting commissions (or approximately $5.175 million if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which equals 3.0% 
of the gross proceeds from the units offered to the public, until consummation 
of our initial business combination. Upon consummation of our initial business 
combination, approximately $4.5 million, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
deferred commissions (or approximately $5.175 million if the underwriters’ 
over allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters 
from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
released to us.  
    
(5)   These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. 
In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject 
to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with 
legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, 
our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of 
consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not 
anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations 
among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the 
extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, 
would not be available for our expenses. The amount of interest available to 
us from the trust account may be less than $2.25 million as a result of the 
current interest rate environment.  

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business 
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or 
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are 
used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business 
combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that is 
not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including 
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment 
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the 
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for 
working capital. 
  
A total of approximately $149.25 million (or approximately $171.30 million if 
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net 
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in 
this prospectus, including approximately $4.5 million (or approximately $5.175 
million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of 
deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account at JP 
Morgan Chase Bank with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee 
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for a portion of the 
interest income that may be released to us to pay any income and franchise 
taxes and to fund our working capital requirements, as discussed below, and 
any amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of our public shares, none of the 
funds held in the trust account will be released until the earlier of the 
completion of our initial business combination and the redemption of 100% of 
our public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 
21 months from the closing of this offering (subject to the requirements of 
law). 
  
If we elect to increase the initial amount held in the trust account from 
approximately $9.95 per unit, such increase would be funded by an increase in 
the amount of the deferral of the underwriting commissions payable in 
connection with this offering, an increase in the number of sponsor warrants 
to be purchased by our sponsor at a price of $0.75 per warrant and/or a 
reduction from the $1.0 million initially available to us for working capital 
that is not held in the trust account. Public stockholders would own a smaller 
percentage of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis to the 
extent that our sponsor purchases additional warrants. 
  
We believe that amounts not held in the trust account, as well as the interest 
income of up to $2.25 million, subject to adjustment, earned on the trust 
account balance (net of franchise and income taxes payable) that may be 
released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay 
the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is 
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a 
target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to 
undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the 
relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a 
letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of 
a business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking 
in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than 
the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available 
to use from the trust account is less than $2.25 million as a result of the 
current interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional 
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital 
through loans or additional investments from members of our management 
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to 
advance funds to, or invest in, us. To the extent that the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option, the maximum amount of interest income 
we may withdraw from the trust account will proportionately increase. In 
addition, if the size of this offering is increased or decreased, it would 
result in a proportionate increase or decrease in the amount of interest we 
may withdraw from the trust account. We will use such a proportionate increase 
in interest income to cover our working capital expenses. While we currently 
do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and while they 
will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, we believe 
that any additional interest income released to us would facilitate our 
ability to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater number of 
potential acquisition targets. 
  
Commencing on the date our securities are first quoted on the OTCBB, we 
have agreed to pay Hicks Holdings Operating LLC, an entity owned and 
controlled by Thomas O. Hicks, our founder and chairman of the board, a total 
of $10,000 per month for office space, administrative services and secretarial 
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Mr. Hicks for our benefit and 
is not intended to provide Mr. Hicks compensation in lieu of salary or other 
remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could 
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our initial 
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly 
fees. 
  
As of the date of this prospectus, Mr. Hicks, our founder and chairman of the 
board, has advanced to us a total of $225,000 to be used for a portion of the 
expenses of this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured 
and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2010 or the closing of this 
offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of 
the $1.75 million of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment 
of offering expenses. 
  
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts,
other than the interest on such proceeds that may be released to us for 
working capital purposes. Up to $500,000 of such loans may be convertible 
into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $0.75 
per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to 
the sponsor warrants. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, 
if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect 
to such loans. 
  
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules in connection with 
our business combination, prior to the consummation of our initial business 
combination, there could be released to us from the trust account amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares sold in this offering (2,250,000 
shares, or 2,587,500 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full). These purchases could occur at any time commencing after 
the filing of a preliminary proxy statement for our initial business 
combination and ending on the record date for the stockholder meeting 
to approve the initial business combination. Purchases will be made only in 
open market transactions at times when we are not in possession of any 
material non-public information and may not be made during a restricted
period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. It is intended that 
purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, at prices 
(inclusive of commissions) not to exceed the per-share amount then held in 
the trust account (approximately $9.95 per share or approximately $9.93 per 
share if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). We 
can purchase any or all of the 2,250,000 shares (or 2,587,500 shares if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) we are entitled to 
purchase. It will be entirely in our discretion as to how many shares are 
purchased. Purchasing decisions will be made based on various factors, 
including the then-current market price of our common stock and the terms 
of the proposed business combination. All shares purchased by us will be 
immediately cancelled. Such open market purchases, if any, would be conducted 
by us to minimize any disparity between the then-current market price of our 
common stock and the per-share amount held in the trust account. A market 
price below the per-share trust amount could provide an incentive for 
purchasers to buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary proxy 
statement at a discount to the per-share amount held in the trust account 
for the sole purpose of voting against our initial business combination and 
exercising redemption rights for the full per-share amount held in the trust 
account. Such trading activity could enable such investors to block a business 
combination regardless of its merits by making it difficult to obtain the 
approval of such business combination by the vote of a majority of the 
outstanding shares of common stock voted. 
  
If we hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination 
and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules in 
connection with our business combination, we may enter into privately 
negotiated transactions to purchase public shares from stockholders after 
consummation of the initial business combination with proceeds from our 
trust account. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates 
may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions. Neither we nor 
our directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will make any such
purchases when we or they are in possession of any material non-public 
information not disclosed to the seller. Although we do not currently 
anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, in
the event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of 
those stockholders not receiving any such additional consideration. In 
addition, the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of the 
remaining stockholders, who will experience a reduction in book value per 
share compared to the value received by stockholders that have their shares 
purchased by us at a premium. 
  
In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause 
our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If we enter into an 
acquisition agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing 
condition to our initial business combination that we maintain a minimum net 
worth or certain amount of cash that is substantially greater than $5,000,001, 
we will communicate the details of the closing condition to our public 
stockholders through our tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as 
applicable. Our certificate of incorporation requires us to provide all of 
our stockholders with an opportunity to redeem all of their shares in 
connection with the consummation of any initial business combination. 
Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would 
cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater 
amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we 
would not proceed with such redemption or the related business combination 
and may instead search for an alternate business combination. 
  
The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not 
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested 
only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less 
or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
the Investment Company Act. Because the investment of the proceeds will be 
restricted to these instruments, we believe we will meet the requirements 
for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment 
Company Act. Interest income of up to $2.25 million, subject to adjustment, 
on the trust account balance (net of franchise and income taxes payable) may 
be released to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working 
capital requirements. 
  
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of our consummation of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common 
stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the 
restrictions described in this prospectus, and the redemption of our public 
shares if we are unable to consummate an initial business combination 
within 21 months from the closing of this offering. In no other circumstances 
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the 
trust account. 
  
Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with 
respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the 
consummation of a business combination. In addition, initial stockholders 
have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder 
shares if we fail to consummate a business combination within 21 months from 
the closing of this offering. However, if our initial stockholders, or any of 
our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this 
offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such 
public shares if we fail to consummate a business combination within the 
required time period."

(1)   Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem 
their shares in connection with our successful consummation of our initial 
business combination.  
   
(2)   In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the 
proceeds of a $225,000 loan from Mr. Hicks, as described in this prospectus. 
This loan will be repaid upon consummation of this offering  
out of the $1.75 million of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the 
payment of offering expenses. In the event that offering expenses are less 
than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing 
working capital expenses.  
   
(3)   We have engaged The Klein Group to provide advisory services in 
connection with this offering and our initial business combination. The Klein 
Group will receive $100,000 upon the consummation of the offering and 
reimbursement of up to $15,000 of expenses. The Klein Group will also receive 
$300,000 upon the closing of our initial business combination.  

(4)   The underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $4.5 million of 
their underwriting commissions (or approximately $5.175 million if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which equals 3.0% 
of the gross proceeds from the units offered to the public, until consummation 
of our initial business combination. Upon consummation of our initial business 
combination, approximately $4.5 million, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
deferred commissions (or approximately $5.175 million if the underwriters’ 
over allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters 
from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
released to us.  
    
(5)   These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. 
In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject 
to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with 
legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, 
our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of 
consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not 
anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations 
among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the 
extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, 
would not be available for our expenses. The amount of interest available to 
us from the trust account may be less than $2.25 million as a result of the 
current interest rate environment.  

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business 
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or 
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are 
used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business 
combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that is 
not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including 
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment 
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the 
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for 
working capital. 
  
A total of approximately $149.25 million (or approximately $171.30 million if 
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net 
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in 
this prospectus, including approximately $4.5 million (or approximately $5.175 
million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of 
deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account at JP 
Morgan Chase Bank with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee 
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for a portion of the 
interest income that may be released to us to pay any income and franchise 
taxes and to fund our working capital requirements, as discussed below, and 
any amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of our public shares, none of the 
funds held in the trust account will be released until the earlier of the 
completion of our initial business combination and the redemption of 100% of 
our public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 
21 months from the closing of this offering (subject to the requirements of 
law). 
  
If we elect to increase the initial amount held in the trust account from 
approximately $9.95 per unit, such increase would be funded by an increase in 
the amount of the deferral of the underwriting commissions payable in 
connection with this offering, an increase in the number of sponsor warrants 
to be purchased by our sponsor at a price of $0.75 per warrant and/or a 
reduction from the $1.0 million initially available to us for working capital 
that is not held in the trust account. Public stockholders would own a smaller 
percentage of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis to the 
extent that our sponsor purchases additional warrants. 
  
We believe that amounts not held in the trust account, as well as the interest 
income of up to $2.25 million, subject to adjustment, earned on the trust 
account balance (net of franchise and income taxes payable) that may be 
released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay 
the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is 
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a 
target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to 
undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the 
relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a 
letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of 
a business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking 
in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than 
the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available 
to use from the trust account is less than $2.25 million as a result of the 
current interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional 
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital 
through loans or additional investments from members of our management 
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to 
advance funds to, or invest in, us. To the extent that the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option, the maximum amount of interest income 
we may withdraw from the trust account will proportionately increase. In 
addition, if the size of this offering is increased or decreased, it would 
result in a proportionate increase or decrease in the amount of interest we 
may withdraw from the trust account. We will use such a proportionate increase 
in interest income to cover our working capital expenses. While we currently 
do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and while they 
will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, we believe 
that any additional interest income released to us would facilitate our 
ability to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater number of 
potential acquisition targets. 
  
Commencing on the date our securities are first quoted on the OTCBB, we 
have agreed to pay Hicks Holdings Operating LLC, an entity owned and 
controlled by Thomas O. Hicks, our founder and chairman of the board, a total 
of $10,000 per month for office space, administrative services and secretarial 
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Mr. Hicks for our benefit and 
is not intended to provide Mr. Hicks compensation in lieu of salary or other 
remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could 
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our initial 
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly 
fees. 
  
As of the date of this prospectus, Mr. Hicks, our founder and chairman of the 
board, has advanced to us a total of $225,000 to be used for a portion of the 
expenses of this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured 
and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2010 or the closing of this 
offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of 
the $1.75 million of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment 
of offering expenses. 
  
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts,
other than the interest on such proceeds that may be released to us for 
working capital purposes. Up to $500,000 of such loans may be convertible 
into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $0.75 
per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to 
the sponsor warrants. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, 
if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect 
to such loans. 
  
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules in connection with 
our business combination, prior to the consummation of our initial business 
combination, there could be released to us from the trust account amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares sold in this offering (2,250,000 
shares, or 2,587,500 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full). These purchases could occur at any time commencing after 
the filing of a preliminary proxy statement for our initial business 
combination and ending on the record date for the stockholder meeting 
to approve the initial business combination. Purchases will be made only in 
open market transactions at times when we are not in possession of any 
material non-public information and may not be made during a restricted
period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. It is intended that 
purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, at prices 
(inclusive of commissions) not to exceed the per-share amount then held in 
the trust account (approximately $9.95 per share or approximately $9.93 per 
share if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). We 
can purchase any or all of the 2,250,000 shares (or 2,587,500 shares if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) we are entitled to 
purchase. It will be entirely in our discretion as to how many shares are 
purchased. Purchasing decisions will be made based on various factors, 
including the then-current market price of our common stock and the terms 
of the proposed business combination. All shares purchased by us will be 
immediately cancelled. Such open market purchases, if any, would be conducted 
by us to minimize any disparity between the then-current market price of our 
common stock and the per-share amount held in the trust account. A market 
price below the per-share trust amount could provide an incentive for 
purchasers to buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary proxy 
statement at a discount to the per-share amount held in the trust account 
for the sole purpose of voting against our initial business combination and 
exercising redemption rights for the full per-share amount held in the trust 
account. Such trading activity could enable such investors to block a business 
combination regardless of its merits by making it difficult to obtain the 
approval of such business combination by the vote of a majority of the 
outstanding shares of common stock voted. 
  
If we hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination 
and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules in 
connection with our business combination, we may enter into privately 
negotiated transactions to purchase public shares from stockholders after 
consummation of the initial business combination with proceeds from our 
trust account. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates 
may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions. Neither we nor 
our directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will make any such
purchases when we or they are in possession of any material non-public 
information not disclosed to the seller. Although we do not currently 
anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, in
the event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of 
those stockholders not receiving any such additional consideration. In 
addition, the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of the 
remaining stockholders, who will experience a reduction in book value per 
share compared to the value received by stockholders that have their shares 
purchased by us at a premium. 
  
In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause 
our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If we enter into an 
acquisition agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing 
condition to our initial business combination that we maintain a minimum net 
worth or certain amount of cash that is substantially greater than $5,000,001, 
we will communicate the details of the closing condition to our public 
stockholders through our tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as 
applicable. Our certificate of incorporation requires us to provide all of 
our stockholders with an opportunity to redeem all of their shares in 
connection with the consummation of any initial business combination. 
Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would 
cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater 
amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we 
would not proceed with such redemption or the related business combination 
and may instead search for an alternate business combination. 
  
The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not 
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested 
only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less 
or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
the Investment Company Act. Because the investment of the proceeds will be 
restricted to these instruments, we believe we will meet the requirements 
for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment 
Company Act. Interest income of up to $2.25 million, subject to adjustment, 
on the trust account balance (net of franchise and income taxes payable) may 
be released to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working 
capital requirements. 
  
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of our consummation of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common 
stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the 
restrictions described in this prospectus, and the redemption of our public 
shares if we are unable to consummate an initial business combination 
within 21 months from the closing of this offering. In no other circumstances 
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the 
trust account. 
  
Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with 
respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the 
consummation of a business combination. In addition, initial stockholders 
have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder 
shares if we fail to consummate a business combination within 21 months from 
the closing of this offering. However, if our initial stockholders, or any of 
our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this 
offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such 
public shares if we fail to consummate a business combination within the 
required time period."

approximately $53.4 million,or approximately $61.8 million if the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us and 
assuming an initial public offering price of $9.50 per ADS, the mid-point of 
the estimated range of the initial public offering price shown on the front 
cover of this prospectus. Assuming the number of ADSs offered by us as set 
forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same, and after 
deduction of underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by 
us, a $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price 
of $9.50 per ADS would increase (decrease) the net proceeds of this offering 
by approximately $5.9 million.

The primary purposes of this offering are to obtain additional equity capital, 
create a public market for our ordinary shares represented by ADSs, and 
facilitate future access to capital via public markets. We expect to use the 
net proceeds from this offering, together with available funds, for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures relating 
to the expansion of our operations, and funding possible future acquisitions 
where the use of such U.S. dollar proceeds is permitted by PRC or other laws. 
We have not determined any particular capital expenditures for which we will 
use the net proceeds, and the timing and size of our particular capital 
expenditure needs may change rapidly in response to perceived market 
opportunities, technological changes and actions by our competitors. We do not 
currently have any agreements or understandings for material acquisitions for 
which we intend to allocate a portion of the net proceeds. Therefore, our 
management is currently unable to allocate any specific portions of the net 
proceeds for particular uses.

Pending our use of the net proceeds we receive from this offering, we intend 
to invest our net proceeds in short-term investment grade debt securities or 
to deposit the proceeds into interest-bearing bank accounts. These investments 
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences 
of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a PFIC for 
U.S. federal income taxpayers, which could result in negative tax consequences 
to you.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we, as an offshore holding 
company, are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to 
our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our 
affiliated PRC entities only through loans, in each case subject to 
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements. 
We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government 
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Furthermore, partly
as a result of the restrictions under Circular No. 142, we do not currently 
intend to fund acquisitions within China through foreign capital contributions 
to our subsidiaries in China, including, for example, Renminbi converted from 
the U.S. dollar proceeds raised from this offering. See “Risk Factors—Risk 
Factors Relating to Our Corporate Structure and Regulation of Our Industry—PRC 
regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC 
entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital 
contributions to our PRC operating subsidiaries and affiliated entities and 
limit the use of such funds, which could materially and adversely affect our 
liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.” SAFE Circular No. 
142 does not restrict our use of the U.S. dollar proceeds of this offering to 
fund the acquisition of entities formed outside of China, such as companies 
that utilize a similar offshore holding company structure as we do to conduct 
their business in China. Moreover, SAFE Circular No. 142 does not prevent 
direct investments in or acquisitions of entities in China by our Cayman 
Islands, British Virgin Islands or Hong Kong offshore entities so long as such 
investments or acquisitions comply with other relevant laws and regulations 
relating to foreign investment in China."

this offering will be approximately $94.9 million (or approximately $109.2 
million if the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option), in 
each case after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions of 
approximately $2.9 million (or approximately $3.9 million if the underwriters 
fully exercise their over-allotment option) and estimated offering expenses of 
approximately $3.4 million payable by us. The net proceeds amounts assume that 
2,786,600 common shares are sold to our existing shareholders and certain 
other investors with whom we or our affiliates have an existing relationship, 
including the common shares reserved for sale to certain of our officers and 
directors and other persons associated with us with respect to which, in each 
case, the reduced underwriting discounts and commissions would apply. 

We plan to use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering to 
acquire our targeted assets in accordance with our investment objectives 
and strategies as described in this prospectus. Based on prevailing market 
conditions, our current expectation is that we will use substantially all
of the net proceeds of this offering within three months after completion
of this offering. We expect that the net proceeds of this offering will be 
allocated as follows: 85% to 95% in non-Agency RMBS, 5% to 15% in Agency 
RMBS, 0% to 10% in mortgage-related derivatives including credit default 
swaps on individual RMBS and on ABS indices, and 0% to 10% in our other 
targeted assets and cash. The foregoing percentages do not reflect our 
expected use of leverage, in that they reflect the use of capital that we 
expect to deploy, as opposed to the gross assets that we expect to acquire. 
However, we cannot assure you that we will not change the capital allocation 
described above. Our decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions 
and the opportunities we identify and may be adjusted in response to changes 
in interest rates, economic and credit environments. Capital allocated to 
particular targeted assets may reflect the actual usage of cash, such as in 
connection with the payment of the purchase price for such assets or in 
connection with the posting of collateral with third parties in connection 
with the financing of such assets, or may represent deemed allocations of 
capital pursuant to internal liquidity guidelines in connection with the 
financing or maintenance of such assets. We expect to use the balance of 
the net proceeds of this offering, if any, for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds from 
this offering in interest-bearing, short-term investments, including money 
market accounts. These investments are expected to provide a lower net return 
than we hope to achieve from investments in our longer-term intended use of 
proceeds of this offering.

While we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to acquire our 
targeted assets as described above, we will have significant flexibility in 
using the net proceeds of this offering and may use the net proceeds from 
this offering to acquire assets with which you may not agree or for purposes 
that are different in range or focus than those described above and elsewhere 
in this prospectus or those in which we have historically invested."

 (1)  As of September 3, 2010, none of the offering expenses have been paid and
      no advances have been received from our sponsor, as described below. Any 
      future advances will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not 
      being placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.  

 (2)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
      all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.  

 (3)  The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will 
      remain constant at $545,000 even if the underwriters’ over-allotment is 
      exercised. In addition, up to approximately $2,000,000 of interest income
      earned on the amounts held in the trust account may be available to us to
      pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of presentation, 
      the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net 
      proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.  

 (4)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of 
      these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
      we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
      estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring an initial 
      business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business 
      combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of 
      proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
      allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
      estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from 
      our excess working capital.  

 (5)  We expect to spend approximately $12,000 on initial fees payable to 
      Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and approximately $12,000 in 
      annual fees for each subsequent year for its services as trustee, 
      transfer agent and escrow agent. We expect to pay approximately $140,000 
      in director and officer liability insurance premiums per year. The 
      remainder of the funds available to us for use as working capital will be
      used for miscellaneous expenses and other expenses not yet identified 
      that are incidental to identifying a target business and consummating an 
      initial business combination.  

A total of approximately $40,300,000 (or approximately $46,165,000 if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds 
from this offering and the sale of the sponsor’s warrants described in this 
prospectus will be placed in the trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. 
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. Except for a 
portion of the interest income that may be released to us, the proceeds held 
in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the 
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation of our trust 
account. All amounts held in the trust account that are not paid to public 
shareholders who properly elect to exercise their shareholder redemption 
rights or released to us as interest income will be released on closing of our 
initial business combination with one or more target businesses which 
collectively have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the 
trust account at the time of such business combination plus any amounts 
previously distributed to shareholders who have exercised their shareholder 
redemption rights, subject to a majority of our public shareholders present 
in person or by proxy voting in favor of the business combination and less 
than 49.9% of the public shareholders properly electing to exercise their 
shareholder redemption rights. On release of funds from the trust account and 
after payment of the shareholder redemption price to any public shareholders 
who properly exercise their shareholder redemption rights, and the remaining 
funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial 
combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for using equity, debt 
or other securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust 
account to general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion 
of operations of acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or 
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business 
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of the members of our management team and may include engaging 
market research firms and/or third party consultants. Members of our management
team, or their affiliates or associates, will not receive any compensation for 
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed 
for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection
with such due diligence activities. There is no limit on the amount of such 
expenses reimbursable by us to such persons. Our audit committee will review 
and approve all expense reimbursements made to our sponsor, officers, directors
or their affiliates, and any reimbursements made to members of our audit 
committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the 
interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. 

Interest earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $2,000,000, may 
be released to us to fund our working capital requirements upon the 
consummation of this offering. We will withdraw such earned interest from time 
to time until a maximum of $2,000,000 of such interest has been released from 
the trust account. We believe that amounts not held in the trust account as 
well as (i) the interest income earned on the trust account balance released to
us to pay any tax obligations and (ii) interest income of up to $2,000,000 
earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us (so long as we 
have sufficient funds available to us to pay our tax obligations on such 
interest income or otherwise then due at that time) will, in the aggregate, 
not be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are 
allocated unless either current interest rates increase or we locate an 
investment which pays a higher interest rate than current interest rates. 
Although we do not know the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account 
and are unable to predict an exact amount of time it will take to complete any 
initial business combination, we anticipate that at the current interest rate 
of approximately 0.2% per annum, the interest that will accrue on the trust 
account during the time it will take to identify a target business and complete
an acquisition together with the net offering proceeds not held in trust will 
be insufficient to fund our working capital requirements. In such event, we 
would seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. To the extent that 
our expenses exceed the amounts not held in the trust account and the interest 
income of up to $2,000,000 that may be released to us from the trust account, 
such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate 
an initial business combination. Furthermore, if we complete an initial 
business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by members of our 
management team prior to the business combination’s closing will become an 
obligation of the post-combination business, assuming these out-of-pocket 
expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing. These expenses would be
a liability of the post-combination business and would be treated in a manner 
similar to any other account or loan payable of the combined business. Our 
officers and directors may, as part of any such combination, negotiate the 
repayment of some or all of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that 
have not been reimbursed by us prior to the closing of our initial business 
combination. If the owners of the target business do not agree to such 
repayment, this could cause our officers and directors to view such potential 
initial business combination unfavorably and result in a potential conflict of 
interest. 

To the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as 
consideration to effect an initial business combination, the proceeds held in 
the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used 
to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds 
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research 
and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to 
repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to 
the completion of our initial business combination if the funds available to 
us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

Our sponsor has agreed to advance to us by way of a non-interest bearing loan 
an aggregate amount of up to $200,000 to be used to pay a portion of the 
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC 
registration fees, FINRA filing fees, the non-refundable portion of any other 
fees and accounting and legal fees and expenses. The loan is non-interest 
bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of December 31, 2011 or six months
following the consummation of the proposed offering. The loan will be repaid 
out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account. 

The net proceeds from this offering held in trust will either be maintained in 
an interest-bearing deposit account or, to the extent invested by the trust 
account agent only in United States “government securities” within the meaning 
of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the 
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being 
deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act 
of 1940. This offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on 
investments in government securities. The trust account and the purchase of 
government securities for the trust account is intended as a holding place for 
funds pending the earlier to occur of either: (i) the consummation of our 
primary business objective, which is a business combination, or (ii) absent a 
business combination, liquidation of our trust account and return of the funds 
held in this trust account to our public shareholders. Interest income earned 
on the trust account balance released to us to pay any tax obligations and, in 
addition, interest income of up to $2,000,000 earned on the trust account 
balance may be releasable to us from the trust account to fund a portion of 
our working capital requirements (so long as we have sufficient funds available
to us to pay our tax obligations on such interest income or otherwise then due 
at that time). 

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be 
paid to our sponsor, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates,
for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of 
our initial business combination. However, members of our management team will 
receive reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses 
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent 
that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust 
account and interest income of up to $2,000,000 that is released to us from 
the trust account (so long as we have sufficient funds available to us to pay 
our tax obligations on such interest income or otherwise then due at that 
time), such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us prior to our 
consummation of an initial business combination. In the event an initial 
business combination is consummated by us and irrespective of whether such 
persons remain associated with us, our audit committee and/or our board of 
directors may determine to reimburse such persons for such expenses. There is 
no limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us to such persons. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only in the event of our liquidation of our trust account if we fail to 
complete an initial business combination within the allotted time or if the 
public shareholder seeks to redeem such shares into cash in connection with an 
initial business combination that the public shareholder voted against and such
business combination is completed by us. In no other circumstances will a 
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the
trust account."

 (5)  We expect to spend approximately $12,000 on initial fees payable to 
      Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and approximately $12,000 in 
      annual fees for each subsequent year for its services as trustee, 
      transfer agent and escrow agent. We expect to pay approximately $140,000 
      in director and officer liability insurance premiums per year. The 
      remainder of the funds available to us for use as working capital will be
      used for miscellaneous expenses and other expenses not yet identified 
      that are incidental to identifying a target business and consummating an 
      initial business combination.  

A total of approximately $40,300,000 (or approximately $46,165,000 if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds 
from this offering and the sale of the sponsor’s warrants described in this 
prospectus will be placed in the trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. 
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. Except for a 
portion of the interest income that may be released to us, the proceeds held 
in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the 
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation of our trust 
account. All amounts held in the trust account that are not paid to public 
shareholders who properly elect to exercise their shareholder redemption 
rights or released to us as interest income will be released on closing of our 
initial business combination with one or more target businesses which 
collectively have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the 
trust account at the time of such business combination plus any amounts 
previously distributed to shareholders who have exercised their shareholder 
redemption rights, subject to a majority of our public shareholders present 
in person or by proxy voting in favor of the business combination and less 
than 49.9% of the public shareholders properly electing to exercise their 
shareholder redemption rights. On release of funds from the trust account and 
after payment of the shareholder redemption price to any public shareholders 
who properly exercise their shareholder redemption rights, and the remaining 
funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial 
combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for using equity, debt 
or other securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust 
account to general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion 
of operations of acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or 
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business 
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of the members of our management team and may include engaging 
market research firms and/or third party consultants. Members of our management
team, or their affiliates or associates, will not receive any compensation for 
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed 
for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection
with such due diligence activities. There is no limit on the amount of such 
expenses reimbursable by us to such persons. Our audit committee will review 
and approve all expense reimbursements made to our sponsor, officers, directors
or their affiliates, and any reimbursements made to members of our audit 
committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the 
interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. 

Interest earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $2,000,000, may 
be released to us to fund our working capital requirements upon the 
consummation of this offering. We will withdraw such earned interest from time 
to time until a maximum of $2,000,000 of such interest has been released from 
the trust account. We believe that amounts not held in the trust account as 
well as (i) the interest income earned on the trust account balance released to
us to pay any tax obligations and (ii) interest income of up to $2,000,000 
earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us (so long as we 
have sufficient funds available to us to pay our tax obligations on such 
interest income or otherwise then due at that time) will, in the aggregate, 
not be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are 
allocated unless either current interest rates increase or we locate an 
investment which pays a higher interest rate than current interest rates. 
Although we do not know the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account 
and are unable to predict an exact amount of time it will take to complete any 
initial business combination, we anticipate that at the current interest rate 
of approximately 0.2% per annum, the interest that will accrue on the trust 
account during the time it will take to identify a target business and complete
an acquisition together with the net offering proceeds not held in trust will 
be insufficient to fund our working capital requirements. In such event, we 
would seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. To the extent that 
our expenses exceed the amounts not held in the trust account and the interest 
income of up to $2,000,000 that may be released to us from the trust account, 
such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate 
an initial business combination. Furthermore, if we complete an initial 
business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by members of our 
management team prior to the business combination’s closing will become an 
obligation of the post-combination business, assuming these out-of-pocket 
expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing. These expenses would be
a liability of the post-combination business and would be treated in a manner 
similar to any other account or loan payable of the combined business. Our 
officers and directors may, as part of any such combination, negotiate the 
repayment of some or all of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that 
have not been reimbursed by us prior to the closing of our initial business 
combination. If the owners of the target business do not agree to such 
repayment, this could cause our officers and directors to view such potential 
initial business combination unfavorably and result in a potential conflict of 
interest. 

To the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as 
consideration to effect an initial business combination, the proceeds held in 
the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used 
to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds 
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research 
and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to 
repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to 
the completion of our initial business combination if the funds available to 
us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

Our sponsor has agreed to advance to us by way of a non-interest bearing loan 
an aggregate amount of up to $200,000 to be used to pay a portion of the 
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC 
registration fees, FINRA filing fees, the non-refundable portion of any other 
fees and accounting and legal fees and expenses. The loan is non-interest 
bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of December 31, 2011 or six months
following the consummation of the proposed offering. The loan will be repaid 
out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account. 

The net proceeds from this offering held in trust will either be maintained in 
an interest-bearing deposit account or, to the extent invested by the trust 
account agent only in United States “government securities” within the meaning 
of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the 
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being 
deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act 
of 1940. This offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on 
investments in government securities. The trust account and the purchase of 
government securities for the trust account is intended as a holding place for 
funds pending the earlier to occur of either: (i) the consummation of our 
primary business objective, which is a business combination, or (ii) absent a 
business combination, liquidation of our trust account and return of the funds 
held in this trust account to our public shareholders. Interest income earned 
on the trust account balance released to us to pay any tax obligations and, in 
addition, interest income of up to $2,000,000 earned on the trust account 
balance may be releasable to us from the trust account to fund a portion of 
our working capital requirements (so long as we have sufficient funds available
to us to pay our tax obligations on such interest income or otherwise then due 
at that time). 

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be 
paid to our sponsor, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates,
for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of 
our initial business combination. However, members of our management team will 
receive reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses 
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent 
that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust 
account and interest income of up to $2,000,000 that is released to us from 
the trust account (so long as we have sufficient funds available to us to pay 
our tax obligations on such interest income or otherwise then due at that 
time), such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us prior to our 
consummation of an initial business combination. In the event an initial 
business combination is consummated by us and irrespective of whether such 
persons remain associated with us, our audit committee and/or our board of 
directors may determine to reimburse such persons for such expenses. There is 
no limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us to such persons. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only in the event of our liquidation of our trust account if we fail to 
complete an initial business combination within the allotted time or if the 
public shareholder seeks to redeem such shares into cash in connection with an 
initial business combination that the public shareholder voted against and such
business combination is completed by us. In no other circumstances will a 
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the
trust account."

$83.9 million, or approximately $96.7 million if the underwriters exercise 
their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us in this 
offering. These estimates are based upon an assumed initial offering price of 
$11.50 per ADS. A $1.00 change in the initial public offering price would, in 
the case of an increase, increase, and, in the case of a decrease, decrease the
net proceeds of this offering by $7.4 million, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

We plan to use these net proceeds for the following purposes: 

   •  approximately $65.0 million to expand our polysilicon manufacturing 
      facilities; and 
 
   •  approximately $18.9 million to finance capital expenditures for our wafer
      manufacturing business. 
 
The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and allocate the net 
proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business conditions.
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus. 

To the extent that the net proceeds of this offering are not immediately 
applied for the above purposes, we intend to deposit the proceeds into interest
bearing bank accounts withdrawable on demand or to invest in short-term 
investment grade debt securities. 

Since we are an offshore holding company, we will need to make capital 
contributions and loans to our PRC subsidiaries such that the net proceeds of 
the offering can be used in the manner described above. Such capital 
contributions and loans are subject to a number of limitations and approval 
processes under Chinese laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that we can 
obtain the approvals from the relevant governmental authorities, or complete 
the registration and filing procedures required to use our net proceeds as 
described above, in each case on a timely basis, or at all."

(2)  Assumes all shares of common stock are sold in the subscription offering.

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing 
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but
will result in a reduction of Standard Bank’s deposits. The net proceeds may 
vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be more or less 
than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a syndicated 
community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not purchased in 
the subscription and community offerings. 

Standard Financial Corp. may use the proceeds it retains from the offering: 

   •  to invest in securities issued by the U.S. Government, U.S. Government 
      agencies and/or U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed 
      securities and equities, collateralized mortgage obligations and 
      municipal securities;  
   
   •  to finance the acquisition of financial institutions or other financial 
      service companies;  
   
   •  to pay cash dividends to stockholders;  
   
   •  to repurchase shares of our common stock; and  
   
   •  for other general corporate purposes.  

With the exception of the funding of the loan to the employee stock ownership 
plan, Standard Financial Corp. has not quantified its plans for use of the 
offering proceeds for each of the foregoing purposes. Initially, we intend to 
invest a substantial portion of the net proceeds in short-term investments, 
investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities. 

Standard Financial Corp. also intends to contribute $200,000 in cash and a 
number of shares of common stock with a value equal to 3.5% of the shares sold 
in the offering. Initially, a substantial portion of the net proceeds will be 
invested in short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations and 
mortgage-backed securities. 

Under current regulations as applied by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking 
and the Federal Reserve Board regulations, we may not repurchase shares of our 
common stock during the first year following the conversion, except to fund 
equity benefit plans other than stock options or except when extraordinary 
circumstances exist and with prior regulatory approval. 

Standard Bank may use the net proceeds it receives from the offering: 

   •  to expand its banking franchise by establishing or acquiring new 
      branches, or by acquiring other financial institutions or other financial
      services companies;  
   
   •  to fund new loans;  
   
   •  to repay borrowings;  
   
   •  to invest in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage 
      obligations, and debt securities issued by the U.S. Government, U.S. 
      Government agencies and/or U.S. Government sponsored enterprises; and  
   
   •  for other general corporate purposes.  

Standard Bank has not quantified its plans for use of the offering proceeds for
each of the foregoing purposes. Our short-term and long-term growth plans 
anticipate that, upon completion of the offering, we will experience growth 
through increased lending and investment activities and, possibly, 
acquisitions. We currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire 
other banks, thrifts, or other financial services companies. There can be no 
assurance that we will be able to consummate any acquisition. 

Initially, the net proceeds we retain will be invested in short-term 
investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities."

approximately US$61.9 million, or approximately US$73.6 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by 
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We 
currently plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

•  approximately US$15.0 million to expand our research and development 
   efforts; 

•  approximately US$27.6 million to fund our capital expenditures for network 
   and other equipment; and 

•  the remaining amount to fund working capital and for other general corporate
   purposes, including strategic investment in, and acquisitions of, 
   complementary businesses (although we are not negotiating any such 
   investment or acquisition).

To the extent that a certain portion or all of the net proceeds we receive from
this offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we plan to 
invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments or 
bank deposits. These investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of your investment in our ADSs. These 
consequences are described in more detail in ""Taxation—Material United States 
Federal Income Tax Considerations—Passive Foreign Investment Company 
Considerations."" 

In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we are 
permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC 
subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to our PRC 
affiliated entities only through loans, subject to satisfaction of applicable 
government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure you that 
we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a 
timely basis, if at all.

the 8,274,090 shares of common stock sold by us in the offering (or 
approximately $88 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment 
option in full). Our estimated net proceeds from the offering represent the 
amount we expect to receive after the underwriting discount and our payment of 
the other expenses of the offering payable by us. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use these net proceeds as follows: 

 •  approximately $10 million of the net proceeds will be used to pay down our 
    asset backed credit facility with Bank of America, N.A.:  

 •  the interest rate on the asset backed credit facility re-prices at various 
    intervals and has interest rates ranging from 2.75%-4.00%;  

 •  the asset backed credit facility matures mid-February 2011;  

 •  approximately $11 million of the net proceeds will be used to pay off 
    subordinated unsecured notes issued to the seller of TAG as part of the 
    acquisition of TAG;  

 •  the interest rates on the subordinated debt is 8.0% with the exception of 
    $3.4 million of the TAG seller debt that is at 3.0%;  

 •  the TAG seller debt matures February 28, 2011;  

 •  approximately $8 million of the net proceeds will be used to pay off 
    subordinated unsecured notes issued to six of our stockholders to finance 
    the acquisition of IIT (see the section titled “Certain Relationships and 
    Related Party Transactions”);  

 •  the subordinated shareholder debt matures February 2012;  

 •  the interest rate on this subordinated debt is 8%; and  

 •  all subordinated debt is due and payable within seven days of an initial 
    public offering; and  

 •  the balance of the net proceeds will be used for working capital, capital 
    expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including potential 
    acquisitions."

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering and the 
concurrent private placement, based on the initial public offering price of 
$5.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions 
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds 
will be approximately $72.9 million. 

We intend to use our estimated pre-offering cash plus approximately $44.5 
million of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placement for the following purposes: 

• approximately $46.7 million to fund Phase 3 clinical trials of AN2690 for 
onychomycosis and preclinical and clinical activities through the initial 
Phase 3 clinical trial of AN2728 for psoriasis; and 


• approximately $9.0 million to pay scheduled principal and interest under our 
loan agreement with Lighthouse Capital Partners V, L.P. bearing interest at a 
rate of 9.25% per annum and maturing in December 2011. 

We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds to fund other research and 
development programs, including AN2718 and AN2898, and for working capital, 
capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion 
of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, 
products or companies that complement our business, although we have no 
current understandings, commitments or agreements to do so. 

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placement represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and 
business condition. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with 
certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon 
the completion of this offering and the concurrent private placement or the 
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts 
and timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous 
factors, including the relative success and cost of our research, preclinical 
and clinical development programs, and the amount and timing of revenues, if 
any, received from our collaboration with GSK and any potential other 
collaborations. As a result, management will have broad discretion in the 
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment 
regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering and the 
concurrent private placement. In particular, we might decide to postpone or 
not pursue certain clinical trials or any number of our research and 
development programs, including, for example, AN2718 and AN2898, if the mix of 
proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement and the other 
sources of cash are less than expected. 

Pending any use, as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in a 
variety of capital preservation instruments, including short- and long-term 
interest-bearing obligations, direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government, certificates of deposit and money market funds."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders holding up to 
    3,480,000 of the shares sold in this offering (or 4,002,000 shares if 
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) who 
    properly redeem their shares in connection with our successful 
    completion of our initial business combination. Assuming a per share 
    redemption price of $10.10 per share (or approximately $10.05 per share 
    stock if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), 
    $35,148,000 of the proceeds of this offering (or approximately 
    $40,237,500 if underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
    full) would be payable to such stockholders.  

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been pre-funded with the 
    proceeds of an aggregate of $75,000 in loans and advances, as of 
    July 30, 2010, from two of our sponsors. These loans and advances will 
    be repaid upon the completion of this offering out of the portion of 
    the offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of 
    offering expenses.  

(3) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase 
    of the private placement warrants. For purposes of presentation, 
    the underwriting discount is reflected as the amount payable to the ]
    underwriters upon completion of this offering.  

(4) This amount includes (A) a deferred fee payable to the underwriters 
    equal to 0.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of units to the 
    public, (B) a contingent fee equal to 2.5% of the aggregate amount of 
    the funds released from the trust account to us and/or to our target 
    upon completion of our initial business combination (assuming none of 
    our public stockholders redeem their shares of common stock) payable to 
    Morgan Joseph LLC and such other firms (which may or may not be 
    underwriters), if any, who are instrumental in advising us in 
    connection with the consummation of our initial business combination 
    (in the event that 87% of our public stockholders redeem their shares, 
    we estimate the 0.5% deferred fee equal to $200,000 and the 2.5% 
    contingent fee to equal $131,300 and (C) a contingent fee equal to 
    $100,000 payable to our outside counsel for legal services rendered in 
    connection with this offering,  

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some 
    or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. 
    For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than 
    our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring 
    a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such 
    business combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target 
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the 
    engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use 
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories 
    of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they 
    exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, 
    would not be available for our expenses.  

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with 
an initial business combination, either because the consideration for the 
business combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or 
because we finance a portion of the consideration with our capital stock 
or the issuance of our debt securities. In such event, the proceeds held 
in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will 
be used to finance our operations, to effect other acquisitions, or for 
expenses, as determined by our board of directors at that time. We intend 
to use the $380,000 not held in the trust account for expenses in 
connection with identifying and conducting due diligence investigations 
of potential business combination candidates, including legal and 
accounting fees and other expenses (which may include consulting fees); 
legal, accounting and audit fees and expenses in structuring and 
negotiating a business combination; possible down payments for potential 
business combinations; reverse break-up fees which may be payable to a 
target if the transaction is not consummated; payments for a lock-up or 
“no-shop” provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from 
“shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more 
favorable to such target businesses); legal and audit fees in connection 
with our ongoing reporting obligations; and other miscellaneous expenses. 
While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down 
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular 
proposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a an agreement 
where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, 
the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” 
provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific 
business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. 
If we pay such amounts (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), 
or if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence 
and negotiating our business combination is less than the actual amount 
of such costs, it could result in our not having sufficient funds to 
continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, 
potential target businesses. 

Commencing on the closing of this offering, we have agreed to pay LLM 
Capital Partners LLC a total of $7,500 per month for office space, 
administrative services and secretarial support. This arrangement is 
being agreed to by LLM Capital Partners LLC for our benefit and is not 
intended to provide LLM Capital Partners LLC compensation in lieu of 
other remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable 
as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon the earlier 
of completion of our initial business combination, 18 months from the 
closing of this offering or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees. 

Other than the payment of $7,500 per month payable to LLM Capital Partners 
LLC discussed above, no compensation of any kind (including finders, 
consulting or other similar fees or the issuance of any of our securities) 
will be paid to any of our sponsors, officers, directors or any of our 
or their affiliates, prior to, or for any services that they render in 
order to effectuate, or in connection with the consummation of, our 
initial business combination. However, such persons will receive 
reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as 
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence 
on suitable target businesses and business combinations, as well as 
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of 
prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement 
for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in the 
trust account and currently allocated in the above table to “Legal and 
accounting expenses attendant to the due diligence investigations, 
structuring and negotiations of an initial business combination,” 
“Due diligence (excluding accounting and legal due diligence) of 
prospective target(s)” and “Other miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, 
audit fees and reserves.” Since the role of present management after a 
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination. 
  
As of the date of this prospectus, LLM Structured Equity Fund L.P. and 
John L. Shermyen have loaned and advanced to us an aggregate of $75,000 
to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These advances 
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 
30, 2011 or upon the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid out 
of the portion of the of offering proceeds that has been allocated to 
the payment of offering expenses. 
  
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with 
an intended initial business combination, our sponsors or an affiliate of 
one or more of our sponsors or certain of our officers and directors may, 
but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we 
consummate our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned 
amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not 
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the 
trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust 
account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Such loans may be 
convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a 
price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would 
be identical to the private placement warrants. Other than the conversion 
price described above, the terms of such loans by our officers and 
directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements 
exist with respect to such loans. However, such loans will not have any 
recourse against the trust account nor bear any interest prior to the 
consummation of the business combination and will have other terms that 
are no more favorable to the lenders than could be obtained from a 
third party. 
  
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and 
we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules in 
connection with our initial business combination, we may enter into 
privately negotiated transactions to purchase public shares from 
stockholders following completion of our initial business combination 
with proceeds released to us from our trust account immediately following 
the completion of our initial business combination. Our sponsor, 
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may also purchase 
shares in privately negotiated transactions. Neither we nor our 
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will make any such 
purchases when we or they are in possession of any material non-public 
information not disclosed to the seller. Although we do not currently 
anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, in 
the event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest 
of those stockholders not receiving any such additional consideration. In 
addition, the payment of a premium by us after the completion of our 
initial business combination may not be in the best interest of the 
remaining stockholders who do not redeem their shares. Such stockholders 
will experience a reduction in book value per share compared to the value 
received by stockholders that have their shares purchased by us at a 
premium. There is no limit on the amount of shares that could be 
acquired by us or our affiliates if we hold a stockholder vote. 

The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested only in U.S. 
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or less, or 
in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the 
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being 
deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company 
Act of 1940. The funds held in the trust account will be held in the name 
of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company that is qualified as a 
Massachusetts security corporation. 
  
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of 
the trust account (including interest, but net of franchise and income 
taxes) only in the event of our consummation of a business combination, 
if such public stockholder properly exercises its redemption rights in 
accordance with the conditions set forth in this prospectus, or if we 
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not consummate our initial 
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, 
subject to the limitations described herein. In no other circumstances 
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in 
the trust account. 
  
Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights 
with respect to their initial shares and any public shares they may own 
in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, 
but will be entitled to redeem any public shares they may own in the 
event we do not consummate our initial business combination."
SYSWIN INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/syswin-inc-840657-65565,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/syswin-inc-840657-65565,424B4,11/24/2010,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7577279,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately US$59.8 million 
(or US$69.3 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional ADSs in full) from this offering, after deducting the estimated 
underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the following 
purposes: 

• approximately US$26 million towards business expansion, consisting of: 

• approximately US$10 million towards the expansion into new markets; 

• approximately US10 million towards the expansion of our primary land
  development consultancy and agency business and our commercial property
  business; and 

• approximately US$6 million towards the establishment of real estate financial
  services; 

• approximately US$15 million towards merger and acquisition activities; 

• approximately US$10 million towards training programs, upgrading of IT
  systems and brand promotional activities; and 

• the balance for general corporate purposes, including our working capital
  needs. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty the 
particular uses for all of the net proceeds we will receive upon the 
completion of this offering. The foregoing represents our current intentions 
with respect to the use and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering 
based upon our present plans and business conditions. In addition, we have 
not identified any particular target which we intend to acquire with the 
proceeds of this offering. Accordingly, our management will have significant 
discretion in applying the net proceeds we will receive from the offering. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we believe that the estimated net proceeds 
of this offering, along with existing cash balances and ongoing operating cash 
flows, will provide necessary capital for our contemplated expansion plans. 
Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade obligations. 

On August 29, 2008, State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, 
promulgated Circular 142, a notice regulating the conversion by a 
foreign-invested company of foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting 
how the converted Renminbi may be used. As Circular 142 prohibits 
foreign-invested company to make equity investment with its foreign 
currency-denominated capital, we may not be able to make equity contributions 
to Syswin Xing Ye nor to establish new subsidiaries through Syswin Zhi Di in 
China. However, as Circular 142 only applies to foreign-invested companies 
incorporated in mainland China, even though our ability to make equity
contributions to Syswin Xing Ye is limited, we are able to: 

(i) make equity contribution to Syswin Zhi Di, our subsidiary in the PRC, 
    upon approval from Ministry of Commerce or its local branch. Pursuant to the 
    Law of the PRC on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises, or the WFOE Law, and 
    its implementation rules, as amended, and the Provisions on Change of the 
    Equity Interests of the Investors of a Foreign-Invested Enterprise, a 
    foreign-invested company such as Syswin Zhi Di may increase its registered 
    capital and receive additonal equity contribution from its foreign 
    shareholders, subject to approval from Ministry of Commerce or its 
    local branches. The regulatory authorities are required to conclude 
    its approval process within 30 days; 

(ii) make loans to Syswin Zhi Di through our offshore subsidiaries upon
     registration with SAFE or its local branches. Pursuant to the Interim
     Measures on Administration of Foreign Loans, a foreign-invested company
     is permitted to obtain loans from its foreign shareholder or an related

(iii) make new investments in the PRC through establishing new subsidiaries or
      acqusitions in the PRC, subject to approval from Ministry of Commerce or
      its local branches. Pursuant to the WFOE Law, upon approval from
      Ministry of Commerce or its local branches, SYSWIN Inc. or SYSWIN
      Limited may establish new subsidiaries or acquire companies in China to
      engage in businesses which are permitted for foreign investments. The
      regulatory authorities are required to conclude their approval process
      within 90 days; and 


(iv) fund any mergers and acquisitions outside China. Mergers and acquisitions
     undertaken by SYSWIN Inc. or SYSWIN Limited outside China are generally
     not subject to PRC government approval or foreign exchange control. 

In addition, Circular 142 does not limit the use of foreign currency-
denominated capital by Syswin Zhi Di to fund its working capital. The PRC 
government does not charge any fee for any of the above mentioned approvals 
and registrations. 

Circular 142 requires the foreign-invested company to apply with a commercial
bank regarding the conversion of foreign currencies into Renminbi. The bank
is required to review documents submitted by the foreign-invested company to
verify that the usage of the converted Renminbi is within the business scope
as prescribed in the business license of the applicant. Once the usage is
verified by the commercial bank, the foreign exchange may be converted into
Renminbi. No approval by any governmental authority in the PRC is required
for such currency conversion process."

approximately $72.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us, and 
assuming an initial public offering price of $10.00 per ADS, the midpoint of 
the estimated range of the initial public offering price as set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed 
initial public offering price of $10.00 per ADS would increase (decrease) the 
net proceeds to us from this offering by $7.4 million, after deducting the 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated aggregate 
offering expenses payable by us and assuming no other change to the number
of ADSs offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for the 
following purposes: 
  
• approximately $18.0 million to construct new manufacturing facilities in
  China that will increase our production capacity and also enhance quality 
  control and process standardization of our products;  

• approximately $18.0 million to enhance the scale and frequency of our
  marketing and promotional campaigns;  

• approximately $10.0 million to open flagship stores in China. We plan open
  up to five flagship stores in China by 2012;  

• approximately $10.0 million to establish dedicated research and development
  and sales and marketing centers;  

• approximately $8.0 million to develop new products, including establishing
  a sub-brand targeting younger customers between the ages of 20 and 30;  

• approximately $7.0 million to upgrade our data management systems, including
  rolling out an ERP system; and  

• the remaining amount to fund our working capital and for other general
  corporate purposes, including product launches and new store launches.  

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not 
immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds to us in short-term bank deposits, direct or guaranteed obligations 
of the U.S. government or other short-term money market instruments. 
  
We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling 
shareholders if the underwriters exercise the overallotment option."
"ZOGENIX, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/zogenix-inc-720558-65088,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/zogenix-inc-720558-65088,424B4,11/23/2010,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7576020,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $50.7 million 
(or approximately $58.5 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us 
in this offering, based on the initial public offering price of $4.00 per 
share and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering costs payable by us and assuming that certain of our 
current stockholders purchase all of the 7,138,895 shares of common stock that 
they have indicated an interest in purchasing as described elsewhere in this 
prospectus. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to 
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use 
approximately $35.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund 
Phase 3 clinical trials and related development activities for ZX002 and 
approximately $15.7 million to fund the ongoing commercialization of Sumavel 
DosePro and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Although 
it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe that the 
net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash 
equivalents, future product revenues and borrowings available under our $10.0 
million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations 
for at least the next 12 months. In particular, we believe the portion of the 
net proceeds from this offering intended to fund Phase 3 clinical trials and 
related development activities for ZX002, together with our existing cash and 
cash equivalents, future product revenues and borrowings available under our 
$10.0 million revolving credit facility, will enable us to complete the 
development of ZX002 through our planned submission of an NDA with the FDA, 
although we cannot assure you that this will occur. We may also use a portion 
of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary 
businesses or products; however, we have no current commitments or obligations 
to do so. 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including the commercial success of Sumavel DosePro and the progress 
of our clinical trials and other development and commercialization efforts, as 
well as the amount of cash used in our operations. We therefore cannot 
estimate the amount of net proceeds to be used for the purposes described 
above. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other 
purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of the net 
proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds 
from this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing 
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct 
or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."
AEROFLEX HOLDING CORP.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/aeroflex-holding-corp-825331-63804,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/aeroflex-holding-corp-825331-63804,424B4,11/19/2010,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7569772,"We will receive net proceeds from this offering, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and estimated offering expenses, including a $2.5 million 
transaction fee which will be paid to affiliates of the Sponsors under our 
advisory agreement with them, of approximately $211.8 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds as follows: 

• $190.0 million of the net proceeds will be used to make a capital 
  contribution to Aeroflex to enable it to: 


• purchase a portion of the senior notes; 


• purchase a portion of the senior subordinated unsecured term loans; and 


• pay fees and expenses relating to the foregoing transactions; 


• $16.9 million of the net proceeds will be paid to affiliates of the Sponsors 
  as a termination fee to terminate our advisory agreement with them; 


• $3.9 million of the net proceeds will be paid to our lenders in exchange for 
  an amendment to our senior secured credit facility and for related fees and 
  expenses; and 


• $1.0 million will be used for our general corporate purposes.           

We have commenced a tender offer for a portion of the senior notes and an 
offer to purchase a portion of the senior subordinated unsecured term loans, 
each of which is conditioned upon, among other things, the closing of this 
offering. The principal amounts of senior notes and senior subordinated 
unsecured term loans to be purchased, and the prices to be paid in such 
purchases, will not be determined until after the closing of this offering. 
We cannot assure you that either the tender offer or the offer to purchase 
will be successful, or that we will apply any or all of the $211.8 million of 
net proceeds from this offering to those transactions. If we fail to apply 
such amount to purchase senior notes or senior subordinated unsecured term 
loans, our ongoing interest expense would be higher. 

We currently expect to purchase between $171.6 million and $165.6 million of 
our outstanding indebtedness with the proceeds of the sale of our common 
stock. The purchase will be at a price determined as part of the tender offer 
process. We expect to repurchase the senior notes at 107% to 111% of face 
value and the senior subordinated unsecured term loans at 107% to 111% of face 
value. 

Assuming the application of $190.0 million of the net proceeds of the offering 
after expenses to the repurchase of our senior notes and senior subordinated 
unsecured term loans, our pro forma long term debt after the completion of the 
transactions described above will range from $711.2 million, assuming we are 
able to repurchase all of the notes and loans at the lowest price above, to 
$717.2 million assuming we must pay the maximum purchase price set forth above. 
We will not know whether we can complete the proposed repurchases on these 
terms until after the closing of the offering of common stock contemplated by 
this prospectus, and we may have to pay a price outside of that range of 
prices. In addition, depending on the aggregate principal amount of debt we 
purchase and the price of that debt, our pro forma interest expense, after 
giving effect to this offering and the application of proceeds therefrom, assuming the repurchase had occurred on the first day of fiscal 2010, would have been between $63.8 million and $64.5 million for fiscal 2010. 

As of September 30, 2010, there is $225.0 million aggregate principal amount 
of senior notes outstanding, which notes bear interest at a rate of 11.75% per 
annum and mature on February 15, 2015, and $168.0 million aggregate principal 
amount of the senior subordinated unsecured term loans outstanding (including 
the accrued paid-in-kind interest), which loans bear interest at a rate of 
11.75% per annum and mature on February 15, 2015. 

Goldman, Sachs & Co. may receive a portion of the offering proceeds through 
our purchase of a portion of the senior subordinated unsecured term loans. 
Goldman, Sachs & Co. is the manager of GS Direct, which holds approximately 
$59.3 million of senior subordinated unsecured term loans."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful consummation of our initial
    business combination.
 
(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of a $25,000 loan from J.W. Childs. This loan will be repaid 
    upon consummation of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds
    that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than 
    underwriting commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less 
    than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-
    closing working capital expenses.  
  
(3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $4.375 million of 
     their underwriting commissions (or approximately $5.031  million if the 
     underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which equals 
     3.5% of the gross proceeds from the units offered to the public, until 
     consummation of initial business combination. Upon consummation of our 
     initial business combination, approximately $4.375 million, which 
     constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or approximately 
     $5.031 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
     full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust 
     account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to
     pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses 
     with which our initial business combination occurs, general corporate 
     purposes, payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in 
     connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of
     other companies or for working capital.  
   
(4)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
     all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
     example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our 
     current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a 
     business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
     combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific 
     industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
     associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
     counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
     engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
     diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of 
     proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
     allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
     estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available 
     for our expenses. The amount of interest available to us from the trust 
     account may be less than $1.25 million as a result of the current 
     interest rate environment.  

(5)  Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
     initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
     fees for financing.   
  
A total of approximately $124.95 million (or approximately $143.325 million if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net 
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in 
this prospectus, including approximately $4.375 million (or approximately 
$5.031 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account with 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be 
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or 
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
the Investment Company Act. Except for a portion of the interest income that 
may be released to us to pay any income and franchise taxes and to fund our 
working capital requirements and any amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% 
of our public shares, none of the funds held in the trust account will be 
released until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business 
combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are 
unable to consummate a business combination within 21 months from the closing 
of this offering (subject to the requirements of law). 

We may increase the initial amount held in the trust account from 
approximately $10.00 per unit prior to the effectiveness of the registration 
statement of which this prospectus forms a part. In such case, the increase 
would be funded by an increase in the amount of the deferral of the 
underwriting commissions payable in connection with this offering, 
an increase in the number of sponsor warrants to be purchased by our sponsor 
at a price of $0.75 per warrant and/or a reduction from $800,000 of the 
amount initially available to us for working capital that is not held in the 
trust account. Public stockholders would own a smaller percentage of our 
outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis to the extent that our 
sponsor purchases additional warrants. We do not intend to reduce the initial 
amount to be held in the trust account.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business 
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or 
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are 
used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business 
combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that is not 
applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for 
maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of 
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the initial 
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working 
capital. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income of 
up to $1.25 million, subject to adjustment in the event the size of the 
offering changes as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of any portion of 
the over-allotment option or otherwise, earned on the trust account balance 
(net of franchise and income taxes payable) that may be released to fund our
working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses 
to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that 
while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth 
due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business 
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth 
due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual
amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to use from 
the trust account is less than $1.25 million as a result of the current 
interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, 
the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In 
this event, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional
investments from members of our management team, but such members of our
management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest 
in, us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option or the size 
of this offering is increased, the maximum amount of interest income we may 
withdraw from the trust account will proportionately increase (if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, the size of the 
offering will increase by 15%, and the maximum amount of interest income we 
may withdraw from the trust account will increase to approximately $2.59 
million). In addition, if the size of this offering is decreased, the maximum 
amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust account will 
proportionately decrease. We will use such a proportionate increase in 
interest income to cover our working capital expenses. While we currently do
not know what our future working capital expenses will be and while they will
not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, we believe that 
any additional interest income released to us would facilitate our ability to 
finance the exploration and consideration of a greater number of potential 
acquisition targets. 
  
Commencing on the date that our securities are first quoted on the OTCBB, we 
have agreed to pay J.W. Childs, an entity owned and controlled by John W. 
Childs, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a total of $5,000 per month 
for office space, administrative services and secretarial support. This 
arrangement is being agreed to by Mr. Childs for our benefit and is not 
intended to provide Mr. Childs compensation in lieu of salary or other 
remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could 
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our initial 
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly 
fees. 
  
As of the date of this prospectus, J.W. Childs has advanced to us a total of 
$25,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These 
advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of 
December 31, 2010 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid 
upon the closing of this offering out of the 750,000 offering proceeds 
that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. 
  
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working 
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. 
Up to $500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post 
business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of 
the lender. The warrants would be identical to the sponsor warrants. The terms
of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined 
and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

Unlike many blank check companies, if we seek stockholder approval of our 
initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection 
with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, prior to the
consummation of a business combination, our amended and restated certificate 
of incorporation will permit the release to us from the trust account amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares sold in this offering (1,875,000
shares, or 2,156,250  shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) at any time commencing after the filing of a preliminary 
proxy statement for our initial business combination and ending on the date
of the stockholder meeting to approve the initial business combination. 
Purchases will be made only in open market transactions at times when we are
not in possession of any material non-public information and may not be made 
during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. It is 
intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, 
at prices (inclusive of commissions) not to exceed the per-share amount then 
held in the trust account (approximately $10.00 per share or approximately 
$9.97 per share if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
full). We can purchase any or all of the 1,875,000 shares (or 2,156,250 
shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) we 
are entitled to purchase. It will be entirely in our discretion as to how 
many shares are purchased. Purchasing decisions will be made based on various
factors, including the then current market price of our common stock and the 
terms of the proposed business combination. All shares purchased by us will 
be immediately cancelled. Such open market purchases, if any, would be 
conducted by us to minimize any disparity between the then current market 
price of our common stock and the per-share amount held in the trust account. 
A market price below the per-share trust amount could provide an incentive for
purchasers to buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary proxy 
statement at a discount to the per-share amount held in the trust account for
the sole purpose of voting against our initial business combination and 
exercising redemption rights for the full per share amount held in the trust 
account. Such trading activity could enable such investors to block a business
combination by making it difficult for us to obtain the approval of such 
business combination by the vote of a majority of our outstanding shares of 
common stock. 
  
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant 
to the tender offer rules, we may enter into privately negotiated transactions
to purchase public shares from stockholders following consummation of the 
initial business combination with proceeds released to us from the trust 
account immediately following consummation of the initial business 
combination. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates 
may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions. Neither we nor
our directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will make any such 
purchases when we or they are in possession of any material non-public 
information not disclosed to the seller. Although we do not currently 
anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, in the 
event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of those
stockholders not receiving any such additional consideration. In addition, 
the payment of a premium by us after the consummation of our initial business
combination may not be in the best interest of the remaining stockholders who
do not redeem their shares. Such stockholders will experience a reduction in 
book value per share compared to the value received by stockholders that have
their shares purchased by us at a premium. Except for the limitations 
described above on use of trust proceeds released to us prior to consummating
our initial business combination, there is no limit on the amount of shares 
that could be acquired by us or our affiliates if we hold a stockholder
vote. 
  
In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause 
our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In such case, we would 
not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business 
combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. 
  
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock 
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable 
to consummate an initial business combination within 21 months following the 
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described 
herein. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or 
interest of any kind to or in the trust account. 

Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with 
respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the 
consummation of a business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders 
have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder 
shares if we fail to consummate a business combination within 21 months from 
the closing of this offering. However, if our initial stockholders, or any of 
our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this 
offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such 
public shares if we fail to consummate a business combination within the 
required time period."

from this offering, or approximately $8.8 million assuming the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional ordinary shares in full, after 
deducting estimated underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use all of our net proceeds from this offering for the 
installation of three production lines (production lines 2, 3 and 4) in the 
Evergreen Product facility that we are in the process of completing. We 
expect production line 2 to be installed and begin operating on a large scale 
by February 2011. We plan to begin installing production lines 3 and 4 in 
fiscal year 2011 and to utilize these production lines for production of 
Evergreen Products beginning in November 2011 and April 2012, respectively. 
We currently have no plans, agreements or commitments with respect to any 
material acquisitions or investments in other companies. 

The amounts and timing of these expenditures may vary depending on our 
ability to expand our business, the amount of cash generated by our 
operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of 
growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have 
significant discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds we will 
receive for this offering. Depending on future events and other changes in 
the business climate, we may determine at a later time to use the net proceeds 
for different purposes. 

Pending the use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in 
a variety of capital preservation instruments, including short-term, 
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

    could occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand  
    for the shares or changes in market conditions following the commencement 
    of the offering.

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing 
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment 
but will result in a reduction of Kaiser Federal Bank’s deposits.  The net 
proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the offering may be more 
or less than our estimates.  For example, our expenses would increase if a 
syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not 
purchased in the subscription and community offerings.  In addition, amounts 
shown for the distribution of the net proceeds at the minimum of the offering 
range to fund the loan to the employee stock ownership plan and to be proceeds 
retained by Kaiser Federal Financial Group, Inc. may change if we exercise our 
right to have the employee stock ownership plan purchase more than 6% of the 
shares of common stock offered if necessary to complete the offering at the 
minimum of the offering range. 

Kaiser Federal Financial Group, Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the 
offering: 
  
. to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares 
  of common stock in the offering;  
 
. to invest in securities;  

. to finance the acquisition of financial institutions, although we do 
  not currently have any agreements or understandings regarding any specific 
  acquisition transaction;  

. to pay cash dividends to stockholders;  

. to repurchase shares of our common stock; and  

. for other general corporate purposes.  

Initially, a substantial portion of the net proceeds will be invested in 
short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed 
securities. 
  
Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase 
shares of our common stock during the first year following the completion of 
the conversion, except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior 
regulatory approval. 
  
Kaiser Federal Bank may use the net proceeds it receives from the offering: 
  
. to repay a $20 million Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco borrowing 
  that matures on November 29, 2010 and has a fixed rate of interest of 
  4.77%;  

. to fund the origination of new loans, including multi-family residential, 
  one-to-four family residential, and consumer loans;  

. to enhance existing products and services and to support the development 
  of new products and services;  

. to expand our retail banking franchise by acquiring branches from other 
  financial institutions or by leasing new branches primarily in Southern 
  California, although we do not currently have any agreements or 
  understandings regarding the establishment of specific branches;  

. to acquire other financial institutions, including FDIC-assisted 
  transactions, or other financial services companies primarily in Southern
  California as opportunities arise, although we do not currently have any
  agreements or understandings regarding any specific acquisition;  

. to invest in securities; and  

. and for other general corporate purposes.  
  
Initially, a substantial portion of the net proceeds will be invested in 
short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed 
securities.  We have not determined specific amounts of the net proceeds that 
would be used for the purposes described above. The use of the proceeds 
outlined above may change based on many factors, including, but not limited 
to, changes in interest rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting 
the financial services industry, our relative position in the financial 
services industry, the attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our 
operations, and overall market conditions. 
  
We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to our performance 
in recent years, until we are able to reinvest effectively the additional 
capital raised in the offering.  Until we can increase our net interest income 
and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity to be below the 
industry average, which may negatively affect the value of our common stock."

(1) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares, which 
    could occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand  
    for the shares or changes in market conditions following the commencement 
    of the offering.

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing 
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment 
but will result in a reduction of Kaiser Federal Bank’s deposits.  The net 
proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the offering may be more 
or less than our estimates.  For example, our expenses would increase if a 
syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not 
purchased in the subscription and community offerings.  In addition, amounts 
shown for the distribution of the net proceeds at the minimum of the offering 
range to fund the loan to the employee stock ownership plan and to be proceeds 
retained by Kaiser Federal Financial Group, Inc. may change if we exercise our 
right to have the employee stock ownership plan purchase more than 6% of the 
shares of common stock offered if necessary to complete the offering at the 
minimum of the offering range. 

Kaiser Federal Financial Group, Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the 
offering: 
  
. to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares 
  of common stock in the offering;  
 
. to invest in securities;  

. to finance the acquisition of financial institutions, although we do 
  not currently have any agreements or understandings regarding any specific 
  acquisition transaction;  

. to pay cash dividends to stockholders;  

. to repurchase shares of our common stock; and  

. for other general corporate purposes.  

Initially, a substantial portion of the net proceeds will be invested in 
short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed 
securities. 
  
Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase 
shares of our common stock during the first year following the completion of 
the conversion, except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior 
regulatory approval. 
  
Kaiser Federal Bank may use the net proceeds it receives from the offering: 
  
. to repay a $20 million Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco borrowing 
  that matures on November 29, 2010 and has a fixed rate of interest of 
  4.77%;  

. to fund the origination of new loans, including multi-family residential, 
  one-to-four family residential, and consumer loans;  

. to enhance existing products and services and to support the development 
  of new products and services;  

. to expand our retail banking franchise by acquiring branches from other 
  financial institutions or by leasing new branches primarily in Southern 
  California, although we do not currently have any agreements or 
  understandings regarding the establishment of specific branches;  

. to acquire other financial institutions, including FDIC-assisted 
  transactions, or other financial services companies primarily in Southern
  California as opportunities arise, although we do not currently have any
  agreements or understandings regarding any specific acquisition;  

. to invest in securities; and  

. and for other general corporate purposes.  
  
Initially, a substantial portion of the net proceeds will be invested in 
short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed 
securities.  We have not determined specific amounts of the net proceeds that 
would be used for the purposes described above. The use of the proceeds 
outlined above may change based on many factors, including, but not limited 
to, changes in interest rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting 
the financial services industry, our relative position in the financial 
services industry, the attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our 
operations, and overall market conditions. 
  
We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to our performance 
in recent years, until we are able to reinvest effectively the additional 
capital raised in the offering.  Until we can increase our net interest income 
and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity to be below the 
industry average, which may negatively affect the value of our common stock."

We currently have three term loan tranches under our senior secured credit

(the “2013 Term Loans”), a term loan tranche of $500.0 million maturing on 
June 25, 2015 (the “2015 Term Loans”) and a term loan tranche of $580.0 
million maturing on June 28, 2017 (the “2017 Term Loans). We used the proceeds 
of the 2017 Term Loans, which we incurred in May 2010, together with cash on 
hand, to repay all of our then-outstanding senior unsecured subordinated notes 
due 2015. 
  
The applicable margin for borrowings with respect to the (a) 2013 Term Loans 
is currently 0.75% for base rate borrowings and 1.75% for LIBOR borrowings, 
(b) 2015 Term Loans is currently 1.75% for base rate borrowings and 2.75% for
LIBOR borrowings, and (c) 2017 Term Loans is currently 2.75% for base rate 
borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings. 
  
We have not yet determined how we will allocate the reduction of indebtedness 
among our term loan tranches. Management will retain broad discretion in the 
allocation and use of the net proceeds to us from this offering, and will 
determine the allocation of the net proceeds to repay indebtedness following 
the completion of this offering based on a number of factors, including 
remaining maturity, applicable interest rates, outstanding balance and 
ability to reborrow."

approximately $97.2 million, or approximately $114.9 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, 
based on the initial public offering price of $12.00 per ADS, after deducting 
the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from 
the ADSs sold by the selling shareholders. 
  
We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

   •   approximately $25.0 million of the net proceeds for product 
       development;  
   
   •   approximately $25.0 million of the net proceeds for sales and 
       marketing; and  
   
   •   the balance for general corporate purposes, including working 
       capital, approximately $3.0 million to pay a RMB20 million loan drawn 
       from a revolving line of credit facility at an annual interest rate of 
       5.31% that will mature on April 29, 2011, and potential acquisitions, 
       although we have not identified any potential acquisition targets at 
       this time.  

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. 
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event 
occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus.
   
Pending any use of the net proceeds, as described above, we plan to invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments or bank 
deposits. These investments may materially and adversely affect the United

(1)     A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration 
        fee, the FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, 
        have been paid from the funds we received from Ziegler Asset Partners 
        Pty. Ltd. described below. These funds will be repaid out of the 
        proceeds of this offering available to us

(2)     No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase 
        of the insider warrants.  For purposes of presentation, the 
        underwriting discounts are reflected as the amount payable to the 
        underwriters upon consummation of this offering. An additional 
        $960,000 (or $1,104,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in 
        full), all of which will be deposited in trust following the 
        consummation of this offering, is payable to the representative of the 
        underwriters only if and when we consummate a business transaction 
        under certain circumstances.  

(3)     These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
        all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
        example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our 
        current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a 
        business transaction based upon the level of complexity of such 
        business transaction.  In the event we identify an acquisition target 
        in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
        additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the 
        engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing  needs 
        may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to 
        assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate 
        any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations 
        among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations,
        to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category 
        of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

 (4)     The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will 
        remain constant at $800,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. 
        In addition, there can be released to us from the trust account, 
        interest earned on the funds in the trust account  (i) to fund our 
        expenses related to investigating and selecting a target business, 
        negotiating an acquisition agreement and consummating such acquisition 
        and our other working capital requirements and (ii) to pay any amounts 
        we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations. We anticipate 
        having approximately $200,000 (after payment of taxes owed on such         
        interest income) available to us. For purposes of presentation, the 
        full amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net         
        proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.  

(5)     The miscellaneous expenses may include deposits or down payments for a 
        proposed initial business transaction, director and officer liability 
        insurance premiums, brokers’ retainer fees, consulting fees, finders’ 
        fees and fees payable to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our management team
has agreed to purchase warrants exercisable for 8,000,000 ordinary shares at 
a purchase price of $0.50 per warrant in a private placement that will occur 
on or before the date of this prospectus. We will not pay any discounts or 
commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider warrants. All of the 
proceeds we receive from the sale of the insider warrants will be placed in 
the trust account described below.

$64,640,000 (or $73,976,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in 
full), of the net proceeds of this offering, will be placed in a trust account 
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A., which account will be maintained by 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. This amount 
includes the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $960,000 
(or $1,104,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), and the 
$4,000,000 of net proceeds from the private placement in which our management 
team will purchase 8,000,000 insider warrants.  The representative of the 
underwriters has agreed that the deferred underwriting discounts and 
commission will not be paid unless and until we consummate a business 
transaction and have waived their right to receive such payment upon our 
liquidation if we are unable to complete a business transaction.  The funds 
held in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities” 
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting 
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the 
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest income that may be 
released to us from time to time (i) to fund our expenses related to 
investigating and selecting a target business, negotiating an acquisition 
agreement and consummating such acquisition and our other working capital 
requirements and (ii) to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds 
held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of 
the completion of a business transaction or our liquidation. The proceeds held 
in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a 
target business with which we complete a business transaction. We will likely 
use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the 
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our 
expenses relating thereto.  Any remaining proceeds held in the trust account 
which are not used to consummate a business transaction will be disbursed to 
the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, 
be used as working capital to finance the operations of the acquired business 
or businesses. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways, 
including, without limitation, for maintenance or expansion of the operations 
of an acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest 
due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our business transaction, to fund 
strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing 
or new products, and the acquisition of assets for the business. Such funds 
could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we 
had incurred prior to the completion of our business transaction if the funds 
available to us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such 
expenses. 

We have agreed to pay Ziegler Asset Partners, a monthly fee of $10,000 for 
office space and administrative and support services.  Ziegler Asset Partners 
is an affiliate of Mr. Ziegler, our chairman of the board and chief executive 
officer.  This arrangement is being agreed to by Peter Ziegler for our benefit 
and is not intended to provide Mr. Ziegler with compensation in lieu of a 
salary or other remuneration.  We believe, based on rents and fees for similar 
services in the Melbourne, Australia area, that the fee charged by Ziegler 
Asset Partners is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from any 
unaffiliated person.  This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a 
business transaction or the distribution of the trust account to our public 
shareholders. 
  
No compensation of any kind, including finder’s, consulting or other similar 
fees, will be paid to any of our initial shareholders, officers and directors, 
or any of their affiliates, for any services rendered prior to or in connection
with the consummation of a business transaction, other than the monthly fee of
$10,000 for office space and administrative and support services referred to 
above, and repayment of a non-interest bearing loan and advances in the 
aggregate of $150,000 as of July 30, 2010 made by Ziegler Asset Partners Pty. 
Ltd., an affiliate of Mr. Ziegler, our chairman of the board and chief 
executive officer, which loan is due on the earlier of July 29, 2011 or the 
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of 
this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses. However, such 
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred 
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying 
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable 
target businesses and business transactions as well as traveling to and from 
the offices, plants, sites, or similar locations of prospective target 
businesses to examine their operations to the extent funds are available from 
the $800,000 held out of trust or the interest income we are permitted to 
withdraw from the trust account.  Our audit committee will review and approve 
all reimbursements made to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or 
their affiliates to the extent that they are in excess of $150,000 in the 
aggregate in any fiscal quarter, and any reimbursements made to members of our 
audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with
any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. Such review 
will encompass an analysis of the corporate purposes advanced by such expenses 
and their reasonableness as compared to similar services or products that 
could have been procured from an independent third party source. There is no 
limit on the total amount of these out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us, 
and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses other than 
by our audit committee and, in some cases, by our board of directors as 
described above, or if such reimbursement is challenged, by a court of 
competent jurisdiction. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out 
of the funds not held in trust. To the extent such out-of-pocket expenses 
exceed the available funds not held in trust and the interest income that may
be released to us as described above, such out-of-pocket expenses will not be 
reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business transaction. Since the role 
of present management after a business transaction is uncertain, we have no 
ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons 
after a business transaction. 
  
The net proceeds from this offering and the private placement available to us 
out of trust for our search for a business transaction will be $800,000.  In 
addition, interest earned on the funds held in the trust account, net of taxes 
payable on such interest, may be released to us from time to time upon our 
request to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target 
business, negotiating an acquisition agreement and consummating such 
acquisition and other working capital requirements. We intend to use these 
funds for director and officer liability insurance premiums, due diligence, 
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring, negotiating and 
consummating business transactions, as well as for reimbursement of any 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our management team in connection with 
activities on our behalf as described above. We will also be entitled to have 
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay 
any tax obligations that we may owe. We believe that these funds will be 
sufficient to allow us to operate for the next 21 months, assuming that a 
business transaction is not consummated during that time. However, we cannot 
assure you that our estimates will be accurate. We may request the release of 
such funds for a number of purposes that may not ultimately lead to a business 
transaction. For instance, we could use a portion of the funds available to us 
to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. 
We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment with respect to a 
particular proposed business transaction, or enter into a letter of intent 
where we pay for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business or 
where we may be required to forfeit funds (whether as a result of our breach 
or otherwise). In any of these cases, or in other situations where we expend 
the funds available to us outside of the trust account for purposes that do 
not result in a business transaction, we may not have sufficient remaining 
funds to continue searching for, or to conduct due diligence with respect to, 
a target business, in which case we would be forced to obtain alternative 
financing or liquidate. 
  
The allocation of net proceeds not held in trust and amounts available from 
the interest income earned on the trust account represents our best estimate 
of the intended uses of these funds. We do not expect to use such amounts for 
anything other than the purposes stated above. However, management may be 
required to pay a different amount than the amount indicated in the table 
above for legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the due diligence 
investigation, structuring and negotiation of a business transaction, 
depending upon the level of complexity of such business transaction. The 
difference, if any, will be allocated to, or deducted from, our working 
capital. 
  
To the extent we are unable to consummate a business transaction, we will pay 
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust 
account. If such funds are insufficient, Mr. Ziegler, our Chairman of the 
Board and Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to advance us the funds 
necessary to complete such liquidation 
  
(currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $25,000) and has 
agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. 
  
A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account,
only in the event of our liquidation or if that public shareholder exercises 
their redemption rights in connection with the consummation of our initial 
business transaction. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have 
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

approximately $73.9 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes for this offering are to increase our working capital, 
create a public market for our common stock, facilitate our access to the 
public capital markets and increase our visibility in our markets. 

We intend to use our proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. The amount and 
timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors, 
including competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, 
if any, of our business. In addition, we also may use a portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies. 
However, we are not currently contemplating any such acquisitions other than 
our acquisition of Winyatek Technology Inc., which closed on June 30, 2010. 

As of the date of this prospectus, however, we have not determined all of the 
anticipated uses for the proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we will 
actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amount and timing of actual 
expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, 
including the amount of cash generated from our operations, competitive and 
technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. 
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in applying the 
net proceeds of this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds as described 
above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

from the sale of 6,000,000 shares of common stock offered in this offering, or 
approximately $54.5 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full, based on the initial public offering price per share and after 
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us.

We currently intend to use approximately $20.0 million of the net proceeds of
this offering for capital expenditures to expand the sequencing and computing 
capacity in our Mountain View and Santa Clara leased facilities. We intend to 
use approximately $15.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering to 
finance the further development of our sequencing technology and services, 
and approximately $10.0 million for sales and marketing activities. We intend 
to use the remainder of the net proceeds of this offering for working capital 
and other general corporate purposes, including the costs associated with 
being a public company.

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plan and business conditions. As of the 
date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the 
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of 
this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in the application 
of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding 
the application of the proceeds of this offering.

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. We 
cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return,

approximately $75.3 million, or approximately $87.0 million if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses 
payable by us. These estimates are based upon an assumed initial public 
offering price of $10.00 per ADS. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed 
initial public offering price of $10.00 per ADS would increase (decrease) the 
net proceeds to us from this offering by $7.8 million, assuming the number of 
ADSs offered by us remains the same and after deducting the estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by 
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan 
to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

   •   $15.0 million to set up new branch offices and expand our coverage 
       network, including hiring additional relationship managers, to carry out
       our geographic expansion strategy to target cities in high growth and 
       relatively more affluent regions (although we have not yet identified

   •   $15.0 million to update our IT infrastructure; 
 
   •   $15.0 million for our capital contribution to funds of funds formed by 
       us; and 
 
   •   the remaining amount for general corporate purposes, including funding 
       potential acquisitions of complementary business, although we are not 
       currently negotiating any such transactions. 
 
The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. 
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus. 

Pending any use, as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits. 

In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we are 
permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC 
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to other entities 
only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government 
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to 
our PRC subsidiary or make additional capital contributions to our PRC 
subsidiary to fund its capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot 
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or 
approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

approximately $90.7 million (approximately $104.7 million if the underwriters 
exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares to cover 
overallotments, if any). This estimate is based upon the initial public 
offering price of $12.00 per share, less estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions and offering expenses payable by us. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering together with approximately
$15.0 million in borrowings under our new senior revolving credit facility for 
the following purposes: 
   
   •   $60.0 million to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the 
       Culligan Refill Acquisition;  
   •   $18.6 million to repay our 14% subordinated convertible notes due March 
       31, 2011;  
   •   $15.7 million to redeem 50% of the outstanding shares of our Series B 
        preferred stock and to pay accrued and unpaid dividends on all 
        outstanding shares of our Series B preferred stock;  
   •   $8.5 million to repay borrowings under our current senior revolving 
       credit facility; and  
   •   $2.9 million to pay fees and expenses in connection with all of the 
       foregoing items.  

This offering, the Culligan Refill Acquisition and our new senior revolving 
credit facility are all effectively conditioned upon each other such that we 
will not close any of these transactions unless we are going to close all of 
them. The underwriting agreement for this offering provides that the following 
are both conditions to the closing of the initial public offering: 
  
   
   •   the satisfaction of all conditions to the Culligan Refill Acquisition; 
        and  
   •   the satisfaction of all conditions to the new senior revolving credit 
       facility and the Company receiving proceeds thereunder in an amount 
       sufficient to consummate the transactions'
 
The condition relating to our new senior revolving credit facility is designed 
to ensure that we generate sufficient proceeds from the combination of this 
offering and the new senior revolving credit facility to accomplish the items 
described above. 
  
In addition, the commitment letter relating to our new senior revolving credit 
facility contains conditions to closing that include our simultaneously 
consummating this offering and having received gross proceeds under the new 
senior revolving credit facility and from this offering in an amount sufficient 
to consummate the Culligan Refill Acquisition and cause all of our 2011 Notes 
to be repaid. Our new senior revolving credit facility will limit our ability 
to borrow more than $20.0 million in connection with the closing of this 
offering. Immediately following the closing of this offering, we anticipate 
availability under our new senior revolving credit facility will increase from 
$20.0 million to approximately $28.0 million. 
  
As of October 5, 2010, we had $18.4 million principal amount of 2011 Notes 
outstanding that bear interest at 14% per annum and mature on March 31, 2011. 
We issued the 2011 Notes on December 30, 2009 and October 5, 2010. We used the 
proceeds from the December 2009 issuance of the 2011 Notes to retire $8.0 
million principal amount of subordinated debt and to repay approximately $7.0 
million of borrowings under our current senior revolving credit facility. We 
are using the proceeds from the October 2010 issuance of $3.4 million of 2011 
Notes to fund the continued expansion of our bottled water exchange and water 
dispenser businesses, to fund offering costs and for working capital purposes. 
Of the $18.6 million in net proceeds from this offering we intend to use to 
repay our 2011 Notes, $5.6 million will be used to repay 2011 Notes held by 
directors, officers and persons known to us to be the beneficial owners of 
more than 5% of our common stock. 
  
Of the $15.7 million in net proceeds we intend to use to redeem 50% of the 
outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock and to pay accrued and unpaid 
dividends on all outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock, $10.7 million 
will be paid to directors, officers and persons known to us to be the 
beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock. 
  
As of September 30, 2010, we had $7.0 million of outstanding borrowings under 
our current senior revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire 
January 30, 2011. Interest on outstanding borrowings under this revolving 
credit facility is payable quarterly at our option at: (i) the greater of (A) 
the LIBOR Market Index Rate or (B) 2.0% plus in either case the applicable 
margin or (ii) the greater of (X) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or (Y) 
the bank’s prime rate plus in either case the applicable margin. At September 
30, 2010, the interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 5.25%. Borrowings 
under our current senior revolving credit facility during the past 12 months
were incurred to grow our business (including investments in equipment and new 
store locations), to fund offering costs and for working capital purposes. 
  
If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, the cash portion of 
the purchase price for the Culligan Refill Acquisition will be increased and 
the number of shares of common stock we will issue to Culligan will be 
decreased by an amount equal to the net cash proceeds we receive as a result 
of such exercise. 
  
Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest such net 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade securities."

proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes and potential future 
vessel acquisitions. We believe that it is currently an attractive time in the 
container shipping cycle to invest. We have no current specific plan for the 
net proceeds, although we may decide to use a portion of the net proceeds, 
together with debt financing, to fund our contracted containership acquisitions.

$120.7 million, based on the initial offering price of $8.50 per ADS, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. 

We anticipate using the net proceeds we receive from this offering for the 
following purposes:

______                             __________________________________________
Approximately $69.7 million     Make LHD equipment-related capital expenditures

Approximately $51.0 million     Repay the principal amount of our outstanding 
                                loan under our facility agreement with Deutsche
                                Bank AG, Hong Kong Branch in full, plus 
                                accrued, unpaid interest.

The loan proceeds of the Deutsche Bank loan facility were used to finance our 
purchase of six LHD units and further purchase of two additional LHD units. 
The interest rates are 4.5%, 6.5% and 8.5% per annum above the LIBOR for the 
first 12 months, the next six months and thereafter, respectively. The loan 
is repayable on January 21, 2015. The lenders have a put option to request 
the repayment of the loan on July 23, 2012. 

Assuming the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option to 
purchase additional ADSs, we will use any remaining portion of the net 
proceeds we receive from this offering for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions of, or investments in, 
other businesses or technologies that we believe will complement our current 
operations and expansion strategies although we are not currently negotiating 
for any such acquisitions or investments. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the ADSs by the selling 
shareholders. 

In addition, the purposes of this offering also include the retention of 
employees by providing them with equity incentives and the creation of a 
public market for our ordinary shares represented by the ADSs for the benefit 
of our shareholders. We do not have any agreements or understandings to make 
any material acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses as of the 
date of this prospectus. 

The foregoing represents our intentions as of the date of this prospectus 
with respect to the use and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering 
based upon our present plans and business conditions, but our management will 
have significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of 
the offering. The occurrence of unforeseen events or changed business 
conditions may result in application of the proceeds of this offering in a 
manner other than as described in this prospectus. 

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not 
immediately applied for the above purposes or where PRC regulation of loans 
and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities delays 
or prevents us from using the net proceeds to make loans or additional capital 
contributions to our PRC operating subsidiary, we intend to invest our net 
proceeds in short-term, interest bearing debt instruments or bank deposits. 
These investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal 
income tax consequences of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that 
we may become a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes, which could result in negative tax consequences for you."

$98.9 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering:

• to repay approximately €24.4 million ($33.2 million) principal amount of
  indebtedness owed to financial institutions outstanding as of the date of
  this prospectus; and

• to repay approximately €1.4 million ($1.9 million) of additional
  indebtedness owed to our shareholders as of the date of this prospectus;

• to pay for various costs associated with the construction or purchase of
  an additional manufacturing facility in or near one of our existing markets,
  amounting to approximately €25.0 million ($34.0 million);

• to pay a one-time termination fee in the amount of €1.75 million ($2.4
  million) to Fortissimo Capital in consideration for terminating our
  Management Services Agreement with them upon the completion of this
  offering; and

• the balance for working capital and for other general corporate purposes.

In addition, we may use all or a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or
invest in complementary companies, products or technologies, although we
currently do not have any acquisitions or investments planned.

The indebtedness to be repaid consists of the following:

• Approximately €10.0 million ($13.6 million) will be used to repay debt
  outstanding as of the date of this prospectus under our existing revolving
  credit lines. As of June 30, 2010, approximately €8.0 million ($10.9
  million) was outstanding under these existing revolving credit facilities.
  Our revolving credit facilities are generally provided for one year and
  renewed on various dates ranging from January to July. Our revolving credit
  lines bear annual interest of between Libor plus 2.3% and Libor plus 5.0%.
  As of June 30, 2010, the weighted average interest rate on our revolving
  credit facilities was 4.6%.

• Approximately €14.3 million ($19.4 million) will be used to repay debt
  outstanding as of the date of this prospectus under existing bank loans
  and approximately €100,000 ($136,000) will be used to repay financing lease
  liabilities. As of June 30, 2010, €12.8 million ($17.4 million) was
  outstanding under bank loans and €100,000 ($136,000) was outstanding under
  financing lease liabilities. Our Euro loans bear annual interest of between
  Libor plus 2.0% and Libor plus 3.9%. Our U.S. Dollar loans bear annual
  interest of Libor plus 1.5%. Our New Israeli Shekel loans bear annual
  interest of Prime plus 2.0%. Our finance leases bear annual interest of
  Prime plus 2.25%. As of June 30, 2010, the weighted average interest rate
  on our bank loans was 4.5% and the weighted average interest rate on our
  finance leases was 5.2%. Principal is generally payable in quarterly
  installments ranging from €28,000 ($38,000) per quarter increasing to
  €156,000 ($212,000) per quarter through December 31, 2010. The final payment
  of the outstanding principal balance is due in March 2015.

• Approximately €1.4 million ($1.9 million) will be used to repay debt
  outstanding as of the date of this prospectus under existing non-convertible
  shareholder loans. Pursuant to our shareholders agreement, these loans bear
  no interest and are to be repaid in twelve quarterly installments after two 
  consecutive years in which our EBITDA exceeds €10.0 million. Our EBITDA for 
  2008 and 2009 exceeded €10.0 million and, therefore, we started to repay
  these loans beginning in March 2010. Our board of directors has decided to
  accelerate repayment of these loans following the consummation of this
  offering.

We will have broad discretion in the way that we use the balance of the net
proceeds of this offering not used to repay indebtedness. Pending use of the 
net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing, 
investment-grade instruments with maturities of less than one year or deposit 
the net proceeds in bank accounts."

price of $9.50 per ADS.

follows:

• approximately $90.0 million for (i) the improvement of our operating 
  platform and technology infrastructure, (ii) the development and offering of
  new services and products to our students through our VIE and its
  subsidiaries to enhance our tutoring services, and (iii) the enhancement of
  our PRC subsidiary's services to our VIE and subsidiaries through

In utilizing the proceeds we expect to receive from this offering, we, as an 
offshore holding company, are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to 
provide funding to our PRC subsidiary and VIE through loans or capital 
contributions, subject to approval from or registration with relevant PRC 
government authorities. For an increase of registered capital of our PRC 
subsidiary, we need to receive approval from MOFCOM or its local counterparts, 
who will decide within 90 days after receiving the application documents. If 
we provide funding to our PRC subsidiary through loans, the total amount of 
such loans may not exceed the difference between its total investment as 
approved by the foreign investment authorities and its registered capital. 
Such loans should be registered with the SAFE which usually takes no more 
than 20 working days to complete. The cost of obtaining such approvals or 
completing such registration is minimal. We currently expect that 
a substantial portion of the proceeds of this offering will be used by our 
PRC subsidiary to meet its working capital needs and for general corporate 
expenses in connection with its business expansion, such as management cost, 
research and development expenses and other expenses in connection with the

     could occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand 
     for the shares or changes in market conditions following the commencement 
     of the offering.  

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing 
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but 
will result in a reduction of SharePlus Federal Bank’s deposits. The net 
proceeds may vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be 
more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a 
syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not 
purchased in the subscription and community offerings. 

SP Bancorp, Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the stock offering: 

   •  to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares of 
      common stock in the stock offering; 
 
   •  to invest in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage 
      obligations, municipal obligations or debt securities issued by agencies 
      of, or entities sponsored by, the United States Government; 
 
   •  to acquire other financial institutions or other financial services 
      companies; 
 
   •  to pay cash dividends to stockholders; 
 
   •  to repurchase shares of our common stock; and 
 
   •  for other general corporate purposes. 
 
With the exception of the funding of the loan to the employee stock ownership 
plan, SP Bancorp, Inc. has not determined how much of the net offering proceeds 
it intends to use for each of the foregoing purposes. Additionally, we do not 
currently intend to pay cash dividends in the immediate future after completion 
of the conversion and stock offering. Initially, we intend to invest a 
substantial portion of the net proceeds in short-term investments, investment-
grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities. 

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase 
shares of our common stock during the first year following the conversion, 
except to fund stockholder-approved stock-based benefit plans other than stock 
options or except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior 
regulatory approval. 

SharePlus Federal Bank may use the net proceeds it receives from the stock 
offering: 

   •  to expand its banking franchise by establishing or acquiring new branches,
      or by acquiring other financial institutions or other financial services 
      companies; 
 
   •  to fund new loans; 
 
   •  to repay short-term borrowings; 
 
   •  to invest in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage 
      obligations, municipal obligations or debt securities issued by agencies 
      of, or entities sponsored by, the United States Government; and 
 
   •  for other general corporate purposes. 
 
SharePlus Federal Bank has not determined how much of the net offering proceeds 
it intends to use for each of the foregoing purposes. Moreover, the actual cost 
to acquire or open a new branch may vary significantly depending on the 
particular opportunity available. Our short-term and long-term growth plans 
anticipate that, upon completion of the offering, we will experience growth 
through increased lending and investment activities, cross-selling our products 
and services to our customers and, possibly, branch acquisitions. We currently 
have no understandings or agreements to acquire other banks, thrifts, other 
financial services companies, or branch offices of any such institutions. 

Initially, the net proceeds we retain will be invested in short-term 
investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities."

     could occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand 
     for the shares or changes in market conditions following the commencement 
     of the offering.  

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing 
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but 
will result in a reduction of SharePlus Federal Bank’s deposits. The net 
proceeds may vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be 
more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a 
syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not 
purchased in the subscription and community offerings. 

SP Bancorp, Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the stock offering: 

   •  to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares of 
      common stock in the stock offering; 
 
   •  to invest in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage 
      obligations, municipal obligations or debt securities issued by agencies 
      of, or entities sponsored by, the United States Government; 
 
   •  to acquire other financial institutions or other financial services 
      companies; 
 
   •  to pay cash dividends to stockholders; 
 
   •  to repurchase shares of our common stock; and 
 
   •  for other general corporate purposes. 
 
With the exception of the funding of the loan to the employee stock ownership 
plan, SP Bancorp, Inc. has not determined how much of the net offering proceeds 
it intends to use for each of the foregoing purposes. Additionally, we do not 
currently intend to pay cash dividends in the immediate future after completion 
of the conversion and stock offering. Initially, we intend to invest a 
substantial portion of the net proceeds in short-term investments, investment-
grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities. 

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase 
shares of our common stock during the first year following the conversion, 
except to fund stockholder-approved stock-based benefit plans other than stock 
options or except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior 
regulatory approval. 

SharePlus Federal Bank may use the net proceeds it receives from the stock 
offering: 

   •  to expand its banking franchise by establishing or acquiring new branches,
      or by acquiring other financial institutions or other financial services 
      companies; 
 
   •  to fund new loans; 
 
   •  to repay short-term borrowings; 
 
   •  to invest in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage 
      obligations, municipal obligations or debt securities issued by agencies 
      of, or entities sponsored by, the United States Government; and 
 
   •  for other general corporate purposes. 
 
SharePlus Federal Bank has not determined how much of the net offering proceeds 
it intends to use for each of the foregoing purposes. Moreover, the actual cost 
to acquire or open a new branch may vary significantly depending on the 
particular opportunity available. Our short-term and long-term growth plans 
anticipate that, upon completion of the offering, we will experience growth 
through increased lending and investment activities, cross-selling our products 
and services to our customers and, possibly, branch acquisitions. We currently 
have no understandings or agreements to acquire other banks, thrifts, other 
financial services companies, or branch offices of any such institutions. 

Initially, the net proceeds we retain will be invested in short-term 
investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities."

from this offering, or approximately $22.7 million assuming the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses 
payable by us. 
    
We intend to use an aggregate of approximately $22 million of the net proceeds 
from this offering to increase our production capacity.  Specifically, our 
plan is to allocate: 
  
   ·  $2 million toward the construction costs associated with the extension 
      of our Maanshan facility; and;  

  
   ·  $20 million toward the purchase and installation of eight new production 
      lines, to be located in the extended facility, which will be used for 
      the production of approximately 30,000 tons annually of coated PC wires 
      and PC strands.  

  
The amounts and timing of these expenditures may vary depending on our ability 
to expand our business, the amount of cash generated by our operations, 
competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of 
our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant discretion in 
the allocation of the net proceeds we will receive for this offering. 
Depending on future events and other changes in the business climate, we may 
determine at a later time to use the net proceeds for different purposes. 
Proceeds from this offering above the amount needed for expansion, if any, 
would be used for working capital. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds 
from this offerings to pay for our anticipated expansion in full, we intend to 
use cash from our operations or bank loans to complete the expansion. 
  
  
Pending the use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a 
variety of capital preservation instruments, including short-term, investment-
grade, interest-bearing instruments."

$225 million under our new credit facility, to make a cash distribution to the
Fund of approximately $300 million and to repay in full approximately
$200 million of the Fund’s debt that we will assume at closing.
 
The approximately $200 million of the Fund’s debt that we will assume and repay
in full at closing was incurred in connection with the Denbury Acquisition under
two credit facilities of the Fund that are secured by mortgages on oil and
natural gas properties, including the Partnership Properties. As of

the additional common units. To the extent the underwriters do exercise their
option to purchase the additional common units, the number of common units
issued to the Fund (as presented in this prospectus) will decrease by, and the
number of common units issued to the public (as presented in this prospectus)
will increase by, the aggregate number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise. The net proceeds from any exercise of
the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units will be paid to the

and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be 
$17,400,000, based on the sale of 2,900,000 shares in this offering at the 
offering price of $6.00 per share. 

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $15.0 million, 
after deducting $1,522,500 for underwriting discounts and commissions and the 
underwriters’ non-accountable expense allowance and other estimated expenses of 
approximately $926,500, which includes legal, accounting, printing costs, and 
various fees associated with the registration and listing of our shares. 

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets 
and to increase our liquidity. Based on approximately $15.0 million in net 
proceeds, we expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for the following 
purposes: 

 •  $8.0 million to conduct and complete the planned Phase III clinical trial 
    of iferanserin (VEN 309) in the treatment of hemorrhoids, consisting of an
    anticipated $750,000 for clinical testing supplies, $6.0 million for direct 
    clinical trial costs including CRO fees, $270,000 for license fees to Amer,
    and $880,000 for carcinogenicity testing and pre-clinical dose ranging, with
    $100,000 set aside for unexpected budget items;  
 
•  $3.8 million to continue the development of diltiazem cream (VEN 307), 
   consisting of $996,000 for license fees to S.L.A. Pharma, $1.4 million for 
   indirect clinical trial costs to complete those trials in the European Union,
   $1.0 million for the development of an improved formulation for use in Phase
   III studies in the U.S., and $373,500 to repay a portion of the $800,000 
   promissory note issued to Israel Discount Bank of New York (we borrowed 
   these funds in September 2010 to make the September 30, 2010 payment to 
   S.L.A. Pharma); and  
 
•  $3.2 million for general and administrative expenses.  

Our highest priority activity is the Phase III clinical trial of iferanserin 
(VEN 309). 

As of the date of this prospectus, we had outstanding convertible notes in the 
principal amount of $11,923,586, which have a maturity date of 
December 31, 2010. The entire principal amount of these notes, plus accrued 
interest, will convert into shares of our common stock upon the completion of 
this offering. However, if the offering is not completed by December 31, 2010, 
the notes will be due and payable on that date. We do not expect to be able to 
repay all of the notes if they mature on December 31, 2010, given our current 
cash position. In such event, we would expect to either (i) seek a further 
extension of the December 31, 2010 maturity date or (ii) use a portion of the
net proceeds of this offering to repay these notes. 

The above list represents our estimate of the use of the net proceeds of this 
offering based upon our current plans and current economic and industry 
conditions, and is subject to reallocation of proceeds between or among the 
categories listed above or to new and additional areas of use. The actual cost,
timing and amount of funds required for such uses cannot be determined 
precisely at this time and may be based, among other things, on economic, 
regulatory, competitive or other developments, the rate of our progress in 
research and development, the results of proposed preclinical studies and 
clinical trials, the timing of regulatory approvals, if any, payments under 
collaborative agreements and the availability of alternative methods of 
financing, if any. Other future events, including delays, expenses and 
complications frequently encountered by development-stage companies as well as 
changes in our planned business, the results of our research and development 
and testing activities may make shifts in the allocation of funds necessary or 
desirable. In addition, in the event that we deem it desirable to acquire 
assets, technologies or other entities in complementary fields, we may 
apportion proceeds of this offering to such acquisition or development. 
Accordingly, our management team will have significant flexibility in applying
the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the use of the net proceeds of the 
offering, we intend to invest them in short-term, investment grade, interest 
bearing securities."

by us in connection with this offering. With the net proceeds from shares that
we sell in this offering and increased borrowings of approximately $7.3 million
under our revolving credit facility, we intend to use $12.0 million to redeem
all of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock, $20.6 million to repay in
full our outstanding subordinated debentures and $14.1 million to pay the
conversion amount on our Class A common stock, $14.0 million of which will be
paid to affiliates of Summit Partners and $0.1 million of which will be paid to
other holders of our Class A common stock, including certain of our executive
officers. 
 
As of September 30, 2010, we had $7.4 million, $2.1 million and $1.9 million
outstanding of our Series A, B and C redeemable preferred stock, respectively;
and $20.0 million of our subordinated debentures outstanding. Any outstanding
Series A and B redeemable preferred stock must be redeemed in full on
December 31, 2034 and any outstanding Series C redeemable preferred stock must
be redeemed in full on December 31, 2035. Our Series A and C redeemable
preferred stock each accrue cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 8.25% per
annum of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of such series of
redeemable preferred stock. Our Series B redeemable preferred stock accrues cash
dividends at a rate per annum of 4.0% plus 90 day LIBOR times the liquidation
preference of $1,000 per share of Series B redeemable preferred stock. As of
September 30, 2010, the dividend rate on our Series B redeemable preferred stock
was 4.5% of the liquidation preference. Our subordinated debentures bear
interest at a rate of 14% per annum and mature on December 13, 2013. We entered
into our $35.0 million revolving credit facility with SunTrust Bank on June 16,
2010, and there was $28.0 million outstanding under the facility on
September 30, 2010. On November 30, 2010, CB&T, a division of Synovus Bank,
entered into a joinder agreement to the revolving credit facility with a
revolving commitment of $20.0 million, which increased the size of the facility
to $55.0 million. Loans under our revolving credit agreement bear interest based
upon a base rate or adjusted LIBO rate (as defined in the revolving credit
agreement) plus an applicable margin. As of September 30, 2010, the interest
rate applicable to our revolving loans was 6.0%. The maturity date for loans
under our revolving credit agreement is June 16, 2013.
 
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders, which include entities affiliated with members of our board of
directors."

(1)   Our new $400.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility will be      
      undrawn immediately after the closing of this offering. Such amount reflects 
      original issue discount of 1.0%.                                             
   
(2)   Our existing senior secured credit facility includes a first lien term loan  
      with an original aggregate principal amount of $1.72 billion, a              
      $300.0 million revolving line of credit, and a $150.0 million synthetic      
      letter of credit facility. As of September 30, 2010, there was $1.49 billion 
      outstanding under the first lien term loan and the first lien term loan is   
      scheduled to mature in May 2014. Interest on the first lien term loan is     
      based upon one of two rate options plus an applicable margin. The base rate  
      is equal to the higher of the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal
      and the Federal Funds Rate in effect plus 0.5% to 1.0%, or LIBOR. We may     
      select the interest rate option at the time of borrowing. The applicable     
      margins for the interest rate options range from 4.5% to 6.0%, depending on  
      the credit rating assigned by Standard and Poor’s Rating Services and Moody’s
      Investor Services. Interest on the first lien term loan is payable on the    
      stated maturity of the first lien term loan, on the date of principal        
      prepayment, if any, with respect to base rate loans, on the last day of each 
      calendar quarter, and with respect to LIBOR rate loans, on the last day of   
      each interest period. As of September 30, 2010, there were no borrowings     
      under the $300.0 million revolving line of credit. The revolving line of     
      credit also includes capacity for letters of credit, and, as of September 30,
      2010, there were outstanding letters of credit under the revolving line of   
      credit totaling $32.6 million, and $267.4 million available for borrowings   
      under the revolving line of credit. The $150.0 million synthetic letter of   
      credit facility was fully utilized at September 30, 2010. In conjunction with
      the closing of this offering and the Concurrent Transactions, we expect the  
      outstanding letters of credit under the revolving line of credit and         
      synthetic letter of credit facility to be cancelled and replaced by          
      outstanding letters of credit under the new senior secured revolving credit  
      facility.                                                                    

(3)   Interest on the senior secured floating rate notes is paid in quarterly      
      installments at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 7.75%. Interest on the senior   
      secured fixed rate notes is paid in semi-annual installments at an annual    
      rate of 12.5%. Based on the number of senior secured notes tendered by       
      December 14, 2010, we have received tenders representing a total of          
      $489.9 million of senior secured fixed rate notes and $192.6 million of      
      senior secured floating rate notes, representing 96.9% and 94.6%,            
      respectively, of the outstanding principal amount of the senior secured fixed
      rate notes and senior secured floating rate notes. Holders of the senior     
      secured notes are entitled to tender through December 17, 2010. Accordingly, 
      the actual number of outstanding senior secured notes tendered may vary as of
      the closing date of the Concurrent Transactions.                 
   
(4)   Reflects fees and expenses consisting of approximately (i) $10.7 million of  
      fees relating to the senior secured term loan, (ii) $4.0 million of fees     
      related to our new revolving senior secured credit facility,                 
      (iii) $10.0 million of fees related to our new senior second-priority secured
      notes, (iv) $41.7 million of premium expense and $3.4 million of dealer      
      manager fees associated with the tender of our existing senior secured notes,
      and (v) $15.0 million of third-party legal, financial, advisory and other    
      fees associated with this offering and the Concurrent Transactions. All fees 
      and expenses are based on the amounts shown in the table above."

maturity dates ranging from December 28, 2010 to November 19, 2011. The proceeds
from such bank borrowings were primarily used to finance our operations.

In addition, the purposes of this offering also include the retention of

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders holding up to 1,683,000 of
    the public shares sold in this offering (or 2,011,350 ordinary shares if 
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) who properly
    redeem their ordinary shares. Such amounts may become payable to our 
    public shareholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with 
    our successful consummation of our initial business transaction. Assuming
    a per share redemption price of $10.20 per share, $17,166,600 of the
    proceeds of this offering (or approximately $20,407,768 if the
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) would be payable
    to such shareholders.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been pre-funded with the proceeds
   of an aggregate of $125,000 in loans from our sponsor. These loans will be
   repaid out of the proceeds of this offering upon the consummation of this
   offering.

(3) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of
   the insider warrants.  For purposes of presentation, the underwriting 
   discount is reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon 
   consummation of this offering. 


(4) This amount assumes that 76.5% (or up to 79.5% if the over-allotment is
    exercised in full) of our public shareholders redeem their ordinary shares
    such that the contingent fees are released from the trust account to us
    and/or to our target upon consummation of our initial business transaction
    and paid to Rodman & Renshaw and/or such other firms, if any, who are
   instrumental in advising us in connection with the consummation of our
    business transaction.

(5) We have agreed to pay our U.S. securities counsel an additional $50,000
    upon completion of an initial business transaction. 

(6) $350,000 will be withheld from the proceeds of this offering for working 
capital purposes.  We also may withdraw up to 100% of the interest earned on 
the proceeds placed in the trust account for working capital purposes. 




(7) These expenses are estimates only.  The expenses also assume our use of 
100% of the interest earned on the trust account over our 18 (or 24) month 
lifespan.  We estimate that we will earn $200,000 in interest on the principal 
amount in the trust account over our 18 (or 24) month lifespan.  Our actual 
expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set 
forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses 
than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a 
business transaction based upon the level of complexity of such business 
transaction.  In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific 
industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.  
Further, the amount of interest available to us from the trust account for 
working capital purposes may be less than $200,000 as a result of lower than 
expected interest rates. 

  

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the insider 
warrants, an aggregate of $20,200,000 (or approximately $23,136,499 if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be deposited 
into the trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and maintained by 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee.  Initially, the 
proceeds of the trust account and the amount held outside the trust account 
will be invested and held outside the U.S.  Additionally, with the exception 
of up to 100% of the interest earned on the proceeds placed in the trust 
account (which may be used for working capital purposes), funds released for 
the payment of taxes and any amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of our 
public shares as described in this prospectus, none of the funds held in trust 
will be released from the trust account, until the earlier of (i) the 
consummation of a business transaction within 18 months from the date hereof 
(or 24 months from the date of this prospectus if a letter of intent, 
agreement in principle or a definitive agreement has been executed within 18 
months from the date of this prospectus and the business transaction relating 
thereto has not yet been completed within such 18-month period), (ii) a 
redemption to public shareholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the 
event we do not consummate a business transaction or (iii) our liquidation. 
The proceeds held in the trust account (net of taxes, up to 100% of the 
interest earned on the proceeds placed in the trust account which we may 
withdraw for working capital purposes and any amounts necessary to purchase up 
to 15% of our public shares as described in this prospectus but exclusive of 
any contingent fees payable or used to pay public shareholders who have 
exercised their redemption rights) may be used as consideration to pay the 
sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business 
transaction or, if there are insufficient funds not held in trust, to pay 
other expenses relating to such transaction such as reimbursement to insiders 
for out-of-pocket expenses, third party due diligence expenses or potential 
finder’s fees, in each case only upon the consummation of a business 
transaction. In the event there are funds remaining in the trust account after 
satisfaction of all of such obligations, such funds may be used to finance 
operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as 
determined by our board of directors at that time. All amounts held in the 
trust account will be released to us on the closing of our initial business 
transaction with a target business, subject to any amounts payable upon the 
exercise of tender offer or redemption rights, as applicable.

We have agreed to pay to FWC Management Services Ltd, an entity controlled by 
Messrs. Valenty and Gupta, $7,500 per-month for office space and other 
facilities located in other jurisdictions, as well as for certain general and 
administrative services, including but not limited to receptionist, 
secretarial and general office services. This agreement commences on the date 
of this prospectus and shall continue until the earliest to occur of: (i) the 
consummation of a business transaction or (ii) 21 months from the date of this 
prospectus. 

We 
intend to use a portion of the $350,000 not held in trust and up to 100% of 
the interest earned on the proceeds placed in the trust account which we may 
withdraw for working capital purposes including due diligence, legal, 
accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition including investment banking 
fees, and other expenses, including structuring and negotiating a business 
transaction, as well as a possible down payment, reverse break up fees (a 
provision which requires a payment to the target company if the financing for 
an acquisition is not obtained), lockup or “no-shop” provision (a provision 
designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions 
with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses), if 
necessary. While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a 
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular 
proposed business transaction, if we were to enter into such an agreement 
where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the 
amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision 
would be determined based on the terms of the specific business transaction 
and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such 
funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not 
having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence 
with respect to, potential target businesses. In addition to the use of funds 
described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to 
consultants to assist us with our search for a target business.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with 
a business transaction, either because the consideration for the business 
transaction is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we 
finance a portion of the consideration with our share capital or the issuance
of our debt securities. In such event, the proceeds held in the trust account 
as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance our 
operations, which may include the target business(es) that we acquire in the 
business transaction, to effect other acquisitions, or for expenses, as 
determined by our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, 
among other things, for director and officer compensation, change-in-control 
payments or payments to affiliates, to finance the operations of the target 
business, to make other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy. 

To the extent that our share capital or the issuance of our debt securities 
are used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business 
transaction, or in the event that indebtedness from third parties is used, in 
whole or in part, as consideration to effect a business transaction, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate 
a business transaction will be disbursed to the combined company and will, 
along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used to finance our 
operations. In the event that third party indebtedness is used as 
consideration, our officers and directors would not be personally liable for 
the repayment of such indebtedness. 

Our sponsor has loaned to us an aggregate of $125,000 which was used to pay
a portion of the expenses of this offering, including: SEC filing fees, FINRA 
filing fees, blue sky fees and expenses and legal and audit fees and expenses.
The loans will be payable without interest upon the earlier of July 9, 2011 
or upon the closing of this offering. We intend to repay the loans out of the 
proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account.  On August 23, 2010, 
we repaid $37,700 in advances from an affiliate of our sponsor. 

The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trust account 
agent only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days 
or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions under Rule 2a-7 
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the 
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being 
deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act 
of 1940. 

Other than the $7,500 per month general and administrative services fees 
described above, no compensation of any kind will be paid to any of our 
officers and directors (directly or indirectly) prior to a business 
transaction.  However, such persons will receive reimbursement, subject to 
board approval, for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection 
with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target 
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses 
and business transactions, as well as traveling to and from the offices, 
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their 
operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the 
funds not held in the trust account and currently allocated in the above 
table to “Legal and accounting expenses attendant to the due diligence 
investigations, structuring and negotiations of a business transaction,” 
“Due diligence (excluding accounting and legal due diligence) of prospective
targets” and “Other miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance and reserves.” 
Since the role of present management after a business transaction is 
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will 
be paid to those persons after a business transaction. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on such public shareholder’s portion of the trust 
account, but net of taxes and up to 100% of the interest earned on the 
proceeds placed in the trust account which we may withdraw for working capital 
purposes) in the event we consummate our initial business transaction, if such 
public shareholder properly exercises his redemption rights in accordance with 
the conditions set forth in this prospectus, upon a redemption to public 
shareholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the event we do not 
consummate a business transaction within the 18 (or 24) month period, or upon 
our liquidation. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any 
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.  Additionally, our 
sponsor (and its shareholders), officers and directors have agreed not to 
exercise their redemption rights with respect to ordinary shares acquired 
during or subsequent to the offering. Our sponsor has also waived its rights 
in any redemption with respect to its initial shares if we fail to consummate 
an initial business transaction within 18 (or 24) months. However, if our 
sponsor or any of our officers, directors, advisors or affiliates acquire 
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to a pro rata share of 
the trust account with respect to such shares upon our distribution of the 
trust account by way of redemption in the event we do not consummate a 
business transaction within the required time period ."

million based on the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share and 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters' overallotment option to purchase 
additional shares from us is exercised in full, we estimate that we will 
receive net proceeds of $12.5 million. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets. We intend to use the net proceeds received by us 
from this offering principally as follows: 

• approximately $40.0 million to expand production capacity in Taiwan, 
  including to (i) pay for the purchase of additional manufacturing space and 
  build out existing space in Hsinchu, (ii) pay the purchase price for the 
  three additional reactors that are expected to be delivered by the end of 
  December 2010, and (iii) purchase additional manufacturing equipment, 
  including reactors, as well as hire additional employees in the next 12 
  months; 

• approximately $10.0 million to build a test line and for research and 
  development expenses related to LED chip production based on 6"" wafers; and 

• the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
  working capital and capital expenditures. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in 
complementary technologies, solutions or businesses or to obtain rights to 
such complementary technologies, solutions or businesses. There are no 
agreements, understandings or commitments with respect to any such acquisition 
or investment at this time. 

Notwithstanding our estimate of the amounts to be used for each of the purposes
discussed above, the amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending 
on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and 
technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. 
Accordingly, our management will have significant discretion in the allocation 
of the net proceeds we will receive for this offering. Depending on future 
events and other changes in the business climate, we may use the net proceeds 
for different purposes. Pending their use, we intend to place our net proceeds 
in short-term bank deposits."
