the common stock offered by us in this offering after deducting estimated 
offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 
$11.7 million. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of 
shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders, including pursuant to 
the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering to repay all 
outstanding indebtedness under our new senior secured credit facility entered 
into in April 2011, approximately $105.0 million of which was outstanding on 
June 30, 2011. We intend to use any remaining net proceeds to partially fund 
the purchase price of our on-order hydraulic fracturing fleets.

As of June 30, 2011, we had approximately $95.0 million available for 
borrowing under our new credit facility. Indebtedness under our credit 
facility was incurred primarily to repay $49.6 million of indebtedness under 
our previous revolving credit facility and $29.9 million of indebtedness, 
accrued interest and early termination penalties under our subordinated term 
loan and to fund $25.0 million of the purchase price for our acquisition of 
Total. Indebtedness under our previous revolving credit facility and our 
subordinated term loan, which were terminated in connection with the 
repayment, were incurred primarily to fund the acquisitions of Fleet 3 and 
Fleet 4. Our new credit facility will mature on April 19, 2016. As of June 
30, 2011, the interest rate under our credit facility was 2.8%. 
Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our credit 
facility and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the proceeds from this 
offering. 
  
We estimate that the selling stockholders will receive net proceeds of 
approximately $194.2 million from the sale of 7,200,000 shares of our common 
stock in this offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. 
If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in 
full, we estimate that the selling stockholders will receive net proceeds 
of approximately $240.7 million. We will pay all expenses related to this 
offering, other than underwriting discounts and commissions related to the 
shares sold by the selling stockholders."

after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. 
  
The selling stockholders will receive approximately $60.5 million in net 
proceeds from their sale of 4,333,333 shares of common stock in this offering, 
or approximately $79.3 million if the underwriters exercise in full their 
option to purchase additional shares of common stock from the selling 
stockholders to cover over-allotments, and in each case after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by the selling stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds 
from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 
  
Our existing senior secured credit facilities, which we entered into in 2010, 
provide for (i) a $75.0 million term loan facility and (ii) a revolving credit 
facility under which we may borrow up to $25.0 million. We used a portion of 
the borrowings under these facilities, together with all of the borrowings 
under our senior subordinated notes due 2014, to redeem, in October 2010, all 
of our outstanding Class A units and for general corporate purposes. In 
connection with the redemption of our Class A units, we paid our Class A 
unitholders approximately $45.8 million, plus a dividend of approximately 
$22.4 million. In connection with this offering, we intend to enter into our 
new senior secured credit facilities, consisting of a $30.0 million new term 
loan facility and $50.0 million revolving credit facility. We intend to use the
net proceeds of this offering, together with borrowings under our new senior 
secured credit facilities, as follows: 
   
   •    To redeem or repurchase all of our outstanding senior subordinated 
        notes due 2014 and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and other 
        related fees, including the call premium of approximately $0.8 million 
        associated with such redemption or repurchase. Interest on our senior 
        subordinated notes accrues at a rate of 20% semi-annually in arrears.
        As of March 25, 2011, approximately $16.3 million in aggregate 
        principal amount of our senior subordinated notes were outstanding. 
        Since October 2010, we have elected to capitalize accrued but unpaid 
        interest on our senior subordinated notes. As of March 25, 2011, we 
        had $1.3 million of capitalized and unpaid interest.  

   •    To repay all of our loans outstanding under our existing senior secured
        credit facilities and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and 
        other related fees. As of March 25, 2011, our existing senior secured 
        term loan facility had an outstanding balance of approximately $72.5 
        million and matures on April 23, 2014. The weighted-average interest 
        rate of our outstanding indebtedness under our existing senior secured 
        term loan facility was 11% for both the year ended December 24, 2010, 
        and the three months ended March 25, 2011. An affiliate of Jefferies & 
        Company, Inc. is a lender under our existing term loan facility and one
        of the holders of our senior subordinated notes and will receive more 
        than 5% of the proceeds from this offering (after taking into account 
        underwriters’ discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable 
        by us). As of March 25, 2011, our existing senior secured revolving 
        credit facility had an outstanding balance of approximately $9.7 
        million and matures on October 22, 2013. The weighted-average interest 
        rate of our outstanding indebtedness under our existing senior secured 
        revolving credit facility was approximately 3.4% for the year ended 
        December 24, 2010, and 3.8% for the three months ended March 25, 2011."

that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $15.0 
million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders, including any shares 
sold by certain of the selling stockholders in connection with the exercise 
of the underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase additional shares.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering in the following 
order:

• to redeem all outstanding shares of our Series A redeemable preferred stock,
 all of which is held by Teavana Investment LLC, for an aggregate redemption
 value of $10,683,333;

• to pay offering-related expenses of approximately $3.2 million; and

• to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under our amended revolving
 credit facility with Fifth Third Bank.

In the event that the net proceeds available to be applied to repay 
indebtedness outstanding under our amended revolving credit facility are less 
than the total amount of debt outstanding under it at the closing of this 
offering, we will pay down that indebtedness by the amount of net proceeds 
available to be applied. We intend to use any remaining net proceeds for 
general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital 
expenditures.

At May 1, 2011, the balance outstanding under our amended revolving credit 
facility was $1.0 million, and the interest rate with respect to those 
borrowings on that date was 6.0%. Our amended revolving credit facility 
expires on April 22, 2016.

The amount and timing of our actual working capital requirements and capital 
expenditures will depend on numerous factors related to the implementation
of our growth plan, including the number of new stores opened in each fiscal
period, increased volumes purchased from our vendors, the expansion of our 
distribution center and other infrastructure investments. Accordingly, our 
management will have broad discretion in the amount and timing of the 
application of the net proceeds to our working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements, and investors will be relying on the judgment of 
our management regarding such application of the proceeds from this offering."

we are offering will be approximately $41.9 million, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the 
underwriters fully exercise their overallotment option, we estimate that the 
net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $48.8 million. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to 
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. 

We intend to use approximately $37.3 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering to fund U.S. commercialization activities for DUEXIS and LODOTRA and 
the remainder to fund regulatory approvals of LODOTRA and DUEXIS, to fund 
required post-marketing studies and development of DUEXIS, to fund development
of LODOTRA for other indications and our other product candidates and for 
working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. 

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade 
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of 
the U.S. government. 

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and 
cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund 
our operations into the second quarter of 2012, including our initial 
commercial launch activities in the U.S. for DUEXIS."

• repay in full the outstanding balance under our existing credit facility;
 
• pay offering expenses of approximately $3.3 million;
 
• terminate, in exchange for a payment of $2.5 million, the advisory services
  agreement between American Midstream, LLC and AIM;

• make an aggregate distribution of approximately $6.6 million, on a pro rata
  basis, to LTIP participants holding common units, AIM Midstream Holdings and
  our general partner. The distribution to AIM Midstream Holdings and our
  general partner will be a reimbursement for certain capital expenditures
  incurred with respect to assets contributed to us.
 
Immediately following the repayment of the outstanding balance under our 
existing credit facility with the net proceeds of this offering, we will 
terminate our existing credit facility and enter into a new credit facility 
and borrow approximately $30.0 million under that credit facility. We will 
use the proceeds from our borrowings to (i) make an aggregate distribution 
of approximately $28.0 million, on a pro rata basis, to LTIP participants 
holding common units, AIM Midstream Holdings and our general partner and (ii)
 pay fees and expenses of approximately $2.0 million relating to our new

secured credit facility. In connection with such repayment, affiliates of 
Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Jefferies & Company, Inc. 
will each receive $9.47 million of such net proceeds, an affiliate of RBC 
Capital Markets, LLC will receive $6.56 million of such net proceeds and 
affiliates of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and KeyBanc Capital 
Markets Inc. will each receive $4.37 million of such net proceeds. On an 
aggregate basis, affiliates of the underwriters will receive $43.7 million of 
the net proceeds from this offering as part of such repayment.

Our existing senior secured credit facility consists of a $95.0 million term 
loan facility and a $5.0 million revolving credit facility, each with a 
scheduled maturity date of November 17, 2013. As of April 30, 2011, we had 
$92.6 million outstanding under our term loan facility and $5.0 million 
available under our revolving credit facility. Immediately prior to the 
completion of this offering, we anticipate that there will be $91.4 million 
of term loans and no amounts of revolving loans outstanding under our existing
senior secured credit facility. We used all of the term loan borrowings, along
with cash on hand, to pay a dividend of $100.0 million on our common stock 
during November 2010. The borrowings under our existing senior secured credit
facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our 
option, either (a) in the case of base rate borrowings, a rate equal to the 
highest of (1) the higher of (i) the prime rate of Royal Bank of Canada and 
(ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (2) the LIBOR for an interest 
period of one month plus 1.00% and (3) 2.75% or (b) in the case of LIBOR 
borrowings, a rate equal to the higher of (1) 1.75% and (2) the LIBOR for the
interest period relevant to such borrowing. The current applicable margin for
borrowings under both the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility
is 5.00% with respect to base rate borrowings and 6.00% with respect to LIBOR
borrowings. The applicable margin for borrowings under both the revolving 
credit facility and the term loan facility for base rate borrowings increases
to 6.50% and 9.00% on June 1, 2012 and June 1, 2013, respectively. The 
applicable margin for borrowings under both the revolving credit facility and
the term loan facility for LIBOR borrowings increases to 7.50% and 10.00% on
June 1, 2012 and June 1, 2013, respectively. As of January 29, 2011, the loans
under our existing senior secured credit facility were LIBOR-based and had an

common stock and the concurrent private placement, after deducting our 
estimated offering and organizational expenses, will be approximately 
$203 million (based on the offering price of $20.00 per share set forth on the
cover of this prospectus), after deducting estimated offering expenses of 
approximately $2.05 million payable by us. We estimate that our net proceeds 
will be approximately $233 million if the underwriters exercise their 
overallotment option in full. Our obligation to pay for the expenses incurred
in connection with this offering and the concurrent private placement will be 
capped at 1% of the total gross proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement (or approximately $2.05 million, and approximately 
$2.35 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full).
Our Manager will pay the expenses incurred above this 1% cap.

All of the shares sold in this offering will be sold to the underwriters at 
$20.00 per share. Our Manager will pay to the underwriters $0.80 per share for
shares sold in this offering. Our total net proceeds from this offering will

overallotment option in full, approximately $233 million), after deducting 
estimated offering expenses. 

Concurrently with this offering, we also expect to sell shares of our common 
stock to certain affiliates of Apollo, including personnel of our Manager, at 
the initial public offering price per share, for an aggregate investment equal
to 2.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering, excluding the 
underwriters’ overallotment option, up to $5 million. No underwriting fee is
payable in connection with the sale of shares to certain affiliates of Apollo,
including personnel of our Manager, in the concurrent private placement. 

We plan to use all of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement to purchase Agency MBS assets. We anticipate that 
approximately 50% of our initial Agency MBS assets will consist of fixed-rate
Agency MBS and that the remaining 50% will consist of ARM Agency MBS. We 
expect that the fixed-rate Agency MBS will have the following characteristics:
(i) coupons ranging from 3.0% to 6.5%; (ii) original maturities of either 
15 years or 30 years; and (iii) current weighted average months to maturity 
ranging from 70 months to 360 months. We expect that the ARM Agency MBS will 
have the following characteristics: (i) net weighted average coupons ranging 
from 2.0% to 6.0%; (ii) with respect to hybrid ARM Agency MBS, original months
to first initial reset of underlying loans of either 36 months, 60 months, 
84 months or 120 months; and (iii) current weighted average months to maturity
ranging from 70 months to 360 months. 

We believe that the depth and liquidity of the Agency MBS market will allow us
to invest a significant portion of our capital in a relatively short period of
time. Depending on the availability of our targeted investments during this 
period, until we invest the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent 
private placement in our target assets, we may temporarily invest in 
interest-bearing short-term investments, including money market accounts, that
are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. Based on current 
market conditions, we expect our initial portfolio will be comprised of Agency
MBS and we expect to diversify this initial portfolio of Agency MBS assets by
investing in non-Agency MBS at first, over the course of several months 
following the closing of this offering and the concurrent private placement. 
We expect to further diversify into residential mortgage loans and other 
residential mortgage assets over time, reaching a fully-diversified portfolio
over the course of approximately one or two years following the closing of 
this offering and the concurrent private placement."

offering will be approximately $74.3 million, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated expenses, based upon the initial 
public offering price of $20.00 per share. We will not receive any proceeds 
from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering: 

     •     to repay the outstanding balance on our unsecured subordinated 
           promissory notes, which was approximately $16.7 million as of 
           March 31, 2011; 
 
     •     to pay the additional consideration of $17.5 million pursuant to 
           our securities purchase and redemption agreement; 
 
     •     to pay approximately $4.4 million, which represents the portion of 
           the principal balance attributable to accrued interest that must be 
           paid in cash upon conversion of our convertible note; and 
 
     •     for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
 
Our unsecured subordinated promissory notes consist of two tranches. The first 
tranche, our 2009 note, was issued in February 2009 and bears interest at 11% 
per annum, which interest is payable quarterly until the 2009 note is repaid 
or until its maturity on February 3, 2013. As of March 31, 2011, $7.3 million 
was outstanding under the 2009 note. 

The second tranche, our 2010 notes, was issued in December 2010 and bears 
interest at 3.3% per annum, which interest is due and payable, together with 
any outstanding principal amount, at maturity. The 2010 notes mature on the 
earlier of December 31, 2012, ten business days following the consummation of 
this offering, ten business days following a sale of a majority ownership 
interest in us, or upon certain events of default. As of March 31, 2011, $9.3 
million was outstanding under the 2010 notes. 

Our securities purchase and redemption agreement provides that we will pay an 
aggregate of $17.5 million as additional consideration to stockholders that 
redeemed certain of their shares in the transaction. The additional 
consideration amount is due on the earlier of December 31, 2013, ten business 
days following the consummation of this offering or ten business days 
following a sale of a majority ownership interest in us. 

A portion of the net proceeds used to repay the unsecured subordinated 
promissory notes and to pay the additional consideration will be received by 
certain of our officers, directors and their affiliates.

In November 2008, we issued a convertible note in the amount of $29.8 million 
to Goode Skullcandy Holdings. The convertible note is secured by a second lien 
on substantially all of our assets and bears interest at 15% per annum, 5% of 
which is paid in cash and 10% of which is accrued and added to the principal 
balance of the convertible note on a quarterly basis. As of March 31, 2011, 
the outstanding balance totaled $34.2 million and the portion attributable to 
accrued interest that must be paid in cash upon conversion was $4.4 million. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire other businesses, 
products or technologies, including our repurchase of the rights previously 
granted to 57 North pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement. However, 
other than our non-binding letter of intent with 57 North, we do not have any 
agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time. Pending 
the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, 
investment grade, interest bearing securities."

our Class A common stock. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot

approximately $66.6 million, based on the initial public offering price of 
$10.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions 
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

• approximately $25.5 million to pay down in full the outstanding balances on 
  our senior secured term loan and revolving credit facilities, which mature on
  January 21, 2015 and September 30, 2011, respectively, of which $20.0 million
  and $5.5 million in principal were outstanding as of March 31, 2011, 
  respectively, which were accruing interest at rates of 9.75% and 4.3%, 
  respectively, as of March 31, 2011; and 

• the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which 
  may include financing our growth, developing new solutions and funding 
  capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments. 

In addition, the other principal purposes for this offering are to: 

• create a public market for our common stock; 

• facilitate our future access to the public capital markets; 

• provide liquidity for our existing stockholders; 

• increase our visibility in our markets; 

• improve the effectiveness of our equity incentive plans in attracting and 
  retaining key employees; and 

• enhance our ability to acquire complementary businesses or technologies. 

Other than paying down the outstanding balances on our senior secured term loan
and revolving credit facilities described above, we have not yet determined 
with any certainty the manner in which we will allocate these net proceeds. Our
management will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of our net 
proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of these expenditures will 
vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated 
by our operations, competitive and technological developments, and the rate of
growth, if any, of our business. For example, if we were to expand our 
operations more rapidly than anticipated by our current plans, a greater 
portion of the proceeds would likely be used for working capital and other 
capital expenditures. Alternatively, if we were to engage in an acquisition 
that contained a significant cash component, some or all of the proceeds might 
be used for that purpose. 

Although we may use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or 
investment in, businesses, services or technologies that will help us expand 
the features and services of our solution, provide us with access to new 
markets or customers, or otherwise complement our business, we have no present 
understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or 
make any investments. We cannot assure you that we will make any acquisitions 
or investments in the future. 

Pending specific use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds to us from the offering in a variety of capital 
preservation investments, including short-term, investment-grade and interest-
bearing instruments."

 (1)  Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their 
      shares in connection with our consummation of our initial business 
      combination.  

 (2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a 
      $200,000 loan from Blue Wolf MHC Ltd., our sponsor, as described in this
      prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon consummation of this offering 
      out of the $600,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the
      payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the
      event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any 
      such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.  

 (3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer $2,100,000 of their underwriting
      commissions (or $2,415,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
      exercised in full), which equals 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the 
      units offered to the public, until consummation of the initial business 
      combination. Upon consummation of our initial business combination, 
      $2,100,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or 
      $2,415,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
      full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust 
      account, and the remaining funds will be released to us.  

 (4)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
      all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
      example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our 
      current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our 
      initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such 
      business combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in 
      a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
      additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the 
      engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may 
      vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist 
      with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change 
      in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the 
      current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the 
      extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of 
      expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount of interest
      available to us from the trust account may be less than $800,000 as a 
      result of the current interest rate environment. Based on the current 
      interest rate environment, we anticipate that approximately $280,000 
      (after payment of taxes on such interest income) will be available to 
      us from interest income to be earned on the funds held in the trust 
      account.  

 (5)  Management estimated the amount of expenses based on its prior experience
      in searching and acquiring companies, as well as the amount of expenses 
      incurred by comparable special purpose acquisition companies.  

A total of $70,000,000 (or $80,237,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the 
sale of the sponsor warrants described in this prospectus, including $2,100,000
(or $2,415,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the 
United States at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, with Continental Stock 
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. 
government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money 
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment 
Company Act and which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for up to 
$800,000 of interest income that may be released to us (net of taxes payable) 
to fund our working capital requirements, as discussed below, and any amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 15% of our public shares if we seek shareholder 
approval of our business combination as will be permitted under our memorandum 
and articles of association, none of the funds held in the trust account will 
be released from the trust account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation 
of our initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of this 
offering and (ii) a redemption to public shareholders prior to any voluntary 
winding-up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination
within the applicable period. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial 
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our 
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account 
that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, 
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income that
may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to
pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target
business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake 
in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant 
prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of 
intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial
business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-
depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less 
than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available 
to use from the trust account is less than $280,000 as a result of the current 
interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the 
amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this 
event, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional 
investments from members of our management team, but such members of our 
management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in,
us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option or the size of 
this offering is increased, the maximum amount of interest income we may 
withdraw from the trust account will proportionately increase (for example, if 
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, the size of the 
offering will increase by 15%, and the maximum amount of interest income (net 
of taxes payable) we may withdraw from the trust account will increase to 
$920,000). In addition, if the size of this offering is decreased, the maximum 
amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust account will 
proportionately decrease. We will use any proportionate increase in interest 
income to cover our working capital expenses. 

While we currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be
and while they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the 
offering, we believe that any additional interest income released to us
would facilitate our ability to finance the exploration and consideration of a 
greater number of potential acquisition targets. 

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the NASDAQ 
Capital Market, to pay Blue Wolf MHC Ltd., our sponsor, an entity controlled by
our officers and directors, or an affiliate of our sponsor, a total of $10,000
per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative 
services. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our benefit 
and is not intended to provide our sponsor compensation in lieu of salary or 
other remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we 
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our 
initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these 
monthly fees. 

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced to us a total of 
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These 
advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of 
December 31, 2011 and the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid 
upon the closing of this offering out of the $600,000 of offering proceeds 
that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial 
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering 
proceeds held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up 
to $500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post 
business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of 
the lender. The warrants would be identical to the sponsor warrants. The terms 
of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined 
and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

Unlike many blank check companies, if we seek shareholder approval of our 
initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection 
with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, prior to the 
consummation of our initial business combination, our memorandum and articles 
of association will permit the release to us from the trust account of amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares sold in this offering (1,050,000
shares, or 1,207,500 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) at any time commencing after the filing of a preliminary 
proxy statement for our initial business combination and ending on the record 
date for the vote to be held to approve our initial business combination. 
Purchases will be made only in open market transactions at times when we are 
not in possession of any material non-public information and may not be made 
during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. It is 
intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, 
which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, 
including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases. If the 
conditions of Rule 10b-18, as in effect at the time we wish to make such 
purchases, are not satisfied, it is likely that we will not make such 
purchases. Any purchases we make will be at prices (inclusive of commissions) 
not to exceed the per-share amount then held in the trust account ($10.00 per 
share or approximately $9.97 per share if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option is exercised in full). We can purchase any or all of the 1,050,000 
shares (or 1,207,500 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) we are entitled to purchase. It will be entirely in our 
discretion as to how many shares are purchased. Purchasing decisions will be 
made based on various factors, including the then current market price of our
ordinary shares and the terms of the proposed business combination. All shares 
purchased by us will be immediately cancelled. Such open market purchases, if 
any, would be conducted by us to minimize any disparity between the then 
current market price of our ordinary shares and the per-share amount held in 
the trust account. A market price below the per-share trust amount could 
provide an incentive for purchasers to buy our shares after the filing of our 
preliminary proxy statement at a discount to the per-share amount held in the 
trust account for the sole purpose of voting against our initial business 
combination and exercising redemption rights for the full per share amount held
in the trust account. Such trading activity could enable such investors to 
block our initial business combination by making it difficult for us to obtain 
the approval of such business combination by the vote of a majority of our 
outstanding ordinary shares. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, we may enter into privately negotiated transactions to 
purchase public shares from shareholders following consummation of the initial 
business combination with proceeds released to us from the trust account 
immediately following consummation of the initial business combination. Our 
sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates also may purchase 
shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the 
consummation of our initial business combination. Although we do not currently 
anticipate paying any premium purchase price (over the trust value) for such 
public shares, in the event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in the 
best interest of those shareholders not receiving any such premium. In 
addition, the payment of a premium by us after the consummation of our initial 
business combination may not be in the best interest of the remaining 
shareholders who do not redeem their shares. Such shareholders may experience 
a reduction in book value per share compared to the value received by 
shareholders that have their shares purchased by us at a premium. Nevertheless,
because any payment of a premium by us will be made only from proceeds released
to us from the trust account following completion of a business combination, no
such payments will reduce the per share amounts available in the trust account 
for redemption in connection with the business combination. Except for the 
limitations described above on use of trust proceeds released to us prior to 
consummating our initial business combination, there is no limit on the amount 
of shares that could be acquired by us or our affiliates, or the price we or 
they may pay, if we hold a shareholder vote. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our 
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption 
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial 
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an 
alternate business combination. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such 
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described 
herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to 
consummate our initial business combination within 21 months following the 
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) 
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other 
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind 
to or in the trust account. 

Our sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its 
founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our 
initial business combination. Our officers and directors in their individual 
capacities (excluding their affiliates), have also agreed to waive their 
redemption rights with respect to any public shares purchased during or after 
the offering in connection with the consummation of our initial business 
combination. In addition, our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to 
liquidating distributions with respect to its founder shares if we fail to 
consummate our initial business combination within 21 months from the closing 
of this offering. However, if our sponsor, or any of our officers, directors 
or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be 
entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public 
shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the 
required time period."

 (1)  Includes amounts payable to public shareholders holding up to 4,257,425 
      of the public shares sold in this offering (or 4,977,425 of the public 
      shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
      who properly redeem their common stock. Such amounts may become payable 
      to our public shareholders who properly redeem their common stock in 
      connection with our consummation of our initial business transaction.
      Assuming a per share redemption price of $10.10 per share, $42,999,995 of
      the proceeds of this offering (or $50,271,999 if the underwriters’ over-
      allotment option is exercised in full) would be payable to such 
      shareholders.  

 (2)  A portion of the offering expenses reflected above under “Estimated 
      Offering Expenses”, such as the SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, 
      legal and accounting fees have been pre-funded with the proceeds of an 
      aggregate of $238,145 (consisting of an initial loan of $33,809 and 
      subsequent loans of $204,336) in loans from Prokopios (Akis) Tsirigakis 
      and George Syllantavos, two of our officers and directors. These loans 
      will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering upon the .
      consummation of this offering.  

 (3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer $480,000 of their underwriting 
      commissions, which equals 1.0% of the gross proceeds from the units 
      offered to the public until consummation of our initial business 
      transaction. Upon consummation of our initial business transaction, 
      $480,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions, will 
      be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, 
      and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all
      or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with 
      which our initial business transaction occurs or for general corporate
      purposes. In the event the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
      exercised, the underwriters have agreed to waive the underwriting 
      discount for the units sold pursuant to the over-allotment option 
      including any deferred underwriting commissions. In addition, the 
      representative of the underwriters will loan us up to $72,000 (depending 
      on the number of units sold in the over-allotment option (or $0.10 per 
      unit)), which loan proceeds will be added to the amount to be held in the
      trust account. This loan will be interest-free and will be payable by us 
      only upon the successful completion of our initial business transaction 
      or can be converted at its option into warrants at $0.75 per warrant 
      (such additional warrants to be identical to the insider warrants and
      will have piggy-back registration rights for the underlying shares). In 
      the event we do not consummate our initial business transaction, the loan
      will not be paid.  

 (4)  Our counsel has agreed to defer legal fees for services provided in 
      connection with the offering in the amount of $100,000. Such deferred 
      legal fees will be payable by us only upon the successful completion of 
      our initial business transaction. In the event we do not consummate our 
      initial business transaction the deferred legal fee will not be paid. 
      Accordingly, the deferred legal fee is not reflected as a cost of this
      offering in the above “Estimated Offering Expenses”.  

 (5)  Miscellaneous expenses may include, among others, payments of fees and 
      costs associated with the use of a transfer agent, warrant agent, 
      trustee, and road show.  

 (6)  $238,145 (consisting of an initial loan of $33,809 and subsequent loans 
      of $204,336) of the $1,536,000 “Estimated Expenses of this Offering” 
      represents the aggregate amounts loaned to us by Messrs. Tsirigakis and 
      Syllantavos to pre-fund certain of the expenses of this offering, and 
      such loan amount will be repaid to Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos 
      from the proceeds of this offering upon its consummation.  

 (7)  315,000 will be withheld from the proceeds of this offering for working 
      capital purposes. We also may withdraw up to 100% of the interest earned
      on the proceeds placed in the trust account for working capital purposes.

 (8)  Includes an amount equal to up to 2.0% of the gross offering proceeds 
      which may, at our sole discretion, be released to us to pay firms, if 
      any, who are instrumental in advising us in connection with the 
      consummation of our business transaction. Such amount may only be 
      released to us in the event we consummate a business transaction and such
      payment shall not reduce the per-share redemption price to below $10.10. 
      Also includes, in the event the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
      exercised in full, the $72,000 loan referred to in footnote 3 above.  

 (9)  Includes $2,331,000 in proceeds from the private placement of warrants.

 (10)  These expenses are estimates only. The expenses also assume our use of
      100% of the interest earned on the trust account over our 19 month 
      lifespan. We estimate that we will earn $135,000 in interest on the 
      principal amount in the trust account over our 19 month lifespan based 
      upon interest rates currently available as of the date of this 
      prospectus. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may 
      differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur 
      greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
      connection with negotiating and structuring a business transaction based 
      upon the level of complexity of such business transaction. In the event 
      we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to 
      specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with 
      legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
      addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
      number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. 
      We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other 
      than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
      which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
      specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. 
      Further, the amount of interest available to us from the trust account 
      for working capital purposes may be less than $135,000 as a result of 
      lower than expected interest rates.  

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the insider 
warrants, an aggregate of $48,480,000 (or $55,200,000 if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $480,000 of deferred 
underwriting commissions, will be deposited into the trust account in the 
United States or the United Kingdom, initially at J.P. Morgan Chase and 
maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee, and 
will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 
days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and 
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. 
Initially, the proceeds of the trust account and the amount held outside the 
trust account will be invested and held outside the U.S. Additionally, with 
the exception of up to 100% of the interest earned on the proceeds placed in
the trust account (which may be used for working capital purposes), funds 
released for the payment of taxes and any amounts necessary to purchase up to 
15% of our public shares as described in this prospectus, none of the funds 
held in trust will be released from the trust account until the earlier of (i)
the consummation of a business transaction within 19 months from the date of 
this prospectus, (ii) our redemption of the public shares sold in this offering
if we are unable to consummate a business transaction within 19 months from 
the date hereof or (iii) our liquidation. Any such withdrawals will not reduce 
the per-share redemption price to below $10.10. The proceeds held in the trust
account (net of taxes, up to 100% of the interest earned on the proceeds placed
in the trust account which we may withdraw for working capital purposes and any
amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of our public shares as described in 
this prospectus) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target 
business with which we ultimately complete a business transaction or, if there 
are insufficient funds not held in trust, to pay other expenses relating to 
such transaction such as reimbursement to insiders for out-of-pocket expenses,
third party due diligence expenses or potential finder’s fees, in each case 
only upon the consummation of a business transaction. In addition, an amount 
equal to up to 2.0% of the gross offering proceeds may, at our sole discretion,
be released to us to pay firms, if any, who are instrumental in advising us in 
connection with the consummation of our business transaction; provided, 
however, that such amount may only be released to us in the event we consummate
a business transaction and such payment shall not reduce the pre-share 
redemption price to below $10.10. In the event there are funds remaining in the
trust account after satisfaction of all of such obligations, such funds may be 
used to finance operations of the target business or to effect other 
acquisitions, as determined by our board of directors at that time. All amounts
held in the trust account will be released to us on the closing of our initial
business transaction with a target business, subject to any amounts payable 
upon the exercise of tender offer or redemption rights, as applicable. 

We have agreed to pay to Fjord NEPA (Greece), an entity controlled by Mr. 
Tsirigakis, $7,500 per-month for office space and other facilities located in 
other jurisdictions, as well as for certain general and administrative 
services, including but not limited to receptionist, secretarial and general 
office services. This agreement commences on the date of this prospectus and 
shall continue until the earliest to occur of: (i) the consummation of a 
business transaction or (ii) 19 months from the date of this prospectus. 

We intend to use a portion of the $315,000 not held in trust and up to 100% of 
the interest earned on the proceeds placed in the trust account which we may 
withdraw for working capital purposes including due diligence, legal, 
accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition including investment banking 
fees, and other expenses, including structuring and negotiating a business 
transaction, as well as a possible down payment, reverse break up fees (a 
provision which requires a payment to the target company if the financing for 
an acquisition is not obtained), lockup or “no-shop” provision (a provision de
signed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with 
other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses), if 
necessar. While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a 
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular 
proposed business transaction, if we were to enter into such an agreement where
we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount
that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be 
determined based on the terms of the specific business transaction and the 
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds 
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with 
respect to, potential target businesses. In addition to the use of funds 
described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to 
consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. 

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with a 
business transaction, either because the consideration for the business 
transaction is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we 
finance a portion of the consideration with our share capital or the issuance 
of our debt securities. In such event, the proceeds held in the trust account 
as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance our 
operations, which may include the target business(es) that we acquire in the 
business transaction, to effect other acquisitions, or for expenses, as 
determined by our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, 
among other things, for director and officer compensation, change-in-control 
payments or payments to affiliates, to finance the operations of the target 
business, to make other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy. 

To the extent that our share capital or the issuance of our debt securities are
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business transaction, or 
in the event that indebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in 
part, as consideration to effect a business transaction, the proceeds held in 
the trust account which are not used to consummate a business transaction will 
be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net 
proceeds not expended, be used to finance our operations. In the event that 
third party indebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors 
would not be personally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness. 

Akis Tsirigakis and George Syllantavos, two of our officers and directors, have
loaned to us $238,145 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this 
offering, including: SEC filing fees, FINRA filing fees, and legal and audit 
fees and expenses. These loans will be payable without interest upon the 
earlier of November 30, 2011 or upon the closing of this offering. We intend to
repay the loan (which prefunded certain of the expenses of this offering) out 
of the proceeds of this offering that are designated for the payment of our 
offering expenses. 

The proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested by the trust 
account agent only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 
days or less, or in money market funds investing solely in United States 
treasury bills and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the investment of the 
proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investment 
company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940. 

Other than the $7,500 per month general and administrative services fees 
described above, no compensation of any kind will be paid to any of our 
officers and directors (directly or indirectly) prior to a business 
transaction. However, such persons will receive reimbursement, subject to board
approval, for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with 
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, 
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business 
transactions. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the 
funds not held in the trust account and currently allocated in the above table
to “Legal and accounting expenses attendant to the due diligence 
investigations, structuring and negotiations of a business transaction,” “Due 
diligence (excluding accounting and legal due diligence) of prospective 
targets”, “Legal and accounting fees relating to SEC reporting obligations“ and
“Other miscellaneous expenses.” Since the role of present management after a 
business transaction is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
transaction. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on such public shareholder’s portion of the trust 
account, but net of taxes and up to 100% of the interest earned on the proceeds
placed in the trust account which we may withdraw for working capital purposes)
in the event we consummate our initial business transaction, if such public 
shareholder properly exercises his redemption rights in accordance with the 
conditions set forth in this prospectus, upon a redemption to public 
shareholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the event we do not 
consummate a business transaction within the 19 month period, or upon our 
liquidation. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Additionally, our sponsors 
(and their shareholders), officers and directors have agreed not to exercise 
their redemption rights with respect to common stock acquired during or 
subsequent to the offering. Our sponsors and directors have also waived their 
rights in any redemption with respect to their initial shares if we fail to 
consummate an initial business transaction within 19 months. However, if our 
sponsors or any of our officers or directors acquire common stock in or after 
this offering, they will be entitled to a pro rata share of the trust account 
with respect to such common stock upon our distribution of the trust account by
way of redemption in the event we do not consummate a business transaction 
within the required time period."

from this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount, 
structuring fee and offering expenses, to: 
  
   •   repay intercompany indebtedness owed to Oiltanking Finance B.V. in the 
amount of approximately $119.5 million;  
   
   •   reimburse Oiltanking Finance B.V. for approximately $7.1 million of 
fees incurred in connection with our repayment of such indebtedness;  
   
   •   make a distribution to OTA in the amount of $47.0 million; and  
   
   •   provide us working capital of $23.4 million.  

As of March 31, 2011, we had approximately $143.8 million of intercompany 
indebtedness outstanding to Oiltanking Finance B.V. with maturities ranging 
from 2014 to 2020 and a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 6.0%. 
This indebtedness was incurred to refinance project debt and for capital 
expenditures. As of July 13, 2011, approximately $142.0 million of such 
intercompany indebtedness remained outstanding. Following the completion of 
this offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described 
above, we expect to have approximately $22.5 million in intercompany 
indebtedness outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 
7.1%. 

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase all 
or a portion of the 1,500,000 additional common units, the number of common 
units purchased by the underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued 
to the public and the remainder of the 1,500,000 additional common units, if 
any, will be issued to OTA. Any such units issued to OTA will be issued for 
no consideration other than OTA’s contribution of equity interests in 
Oiltanking Houston, L.P. and Oiltanking Beaumont Partners, L.P. to us in 
connection with the closing of this offering. If the underwriters exercise 
their option to purchase 1,500,000 additional common units in full, the 
additional net proceeds would be approximately $30.2 million. The net 
proceeds from any exercise of such option will be used to make a distribution 
to OTA. If the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase 
additional common units, we will issue 1,500,000 common units to OTA upon 
the option’s expiration. We will not receive any additional consideration 
from OTA in connection with such issuance. Accordingly, the exercise of the 
underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of common units 
outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly
distribution on all units."

 (1)  Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
      shares in connection with our consummation of our initial business 
      combination.  

 (2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a 
      $100,000 loan from Azteca Acquisition Holdings, LLC, our sponsor. This 
      loan will be repaid upon consummation of this offering out of the 
      $625,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of 
      offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that 
      offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts
      will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.  

 (3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer $3,750,000 of their underwriting 
      commissions (or $4,312,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
      exercised in full), which equals 3.75% of the gross proceeds from the 
      units offered to the public, until consummation of initial business 
      combination. Upon consummation of our initial business combination, 
      $3,750,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or 
      $4,312,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
      full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust 
      account, and the remaining funds will be released to us.  

 (4)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
      all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
      example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our 
      current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our 
      initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such 
      business combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in 
      a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
      additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the 
      engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may 
      vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist 
      with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change 
      in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the 
      current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the 
      extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of 
      expenses, would not be available for our expenses. Based on the current 
      interest rate environment, we anticipate that approximately $420,000 
      (after payment of taxes on such interest income) will be available to us 
      from interest income to be earned on the funds held in the trust account.
      The interest rate used to calculate the $420,000 of interest was 
      calculated using an assumed annual interest rate of approximately 0.25% 
      on the trust account over 21 months.  

A total of $100,500,000 (or $115,237,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the 
sale of the sponsor warrants described in this prospectus, including $3,750,000
(or $4,312,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the 
United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and that invest solely in U.S. 
Treasuries. Except for the interest income that may be released to us (net of 
taxes payable) to fund our working capital requirements, as discussed below, 
and any amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of our public shares if we seek
stockholder approval of our business combination as will be permitted under the
investment management trust agreement to be entered into between us and 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, none of the funds held in the trust
account will be released from the trust account until the earlier of: (i) the 
consummation of our initial business combination within 21 months from the 
closing of this offering and (ii) a redemption to public stockholders prior to 
any voluntary winding-up in the event we do not consummate our initial business
combination within the applicable period. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial 
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our 
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account 
that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, 
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital. Although we believe that the net proceeds of 
this offering, including the interest earned on the proceeds held in the trust 
account that may be available to us for our initial business combination, will 
be sufficient to allow us to consummate our initial business combination, 
because we have not yet identified any prospective target business we cannot 
ascertain the capital requirements, if any, for any particular transaction or 
the sources of such potential financing. Such financing may not be available on
acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment has made it 
especially difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the 
extent additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate 
our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure 
the transaction or abandon that particular initial business combination and 
seek an alternative target business candidate. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income that 
may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to 
pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief 
is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a 
target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to 
undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the 
relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a 
letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our
initial business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of 
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business 
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount 
of interest available to use from the trust account is less than $420,000 as a 
result of the current interest rate environment, we may be required to raise 
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through 
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such 
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds 
to, or invest in, us. 

Commencing on the date that our securities are first quoted on the OTCBB, we 
have agreed to pay Galco, Inc., an affiliate of our sponsor, a total of $10,000
per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative 
services. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our benefit 
and is not intended to provide our sponsor compensation in lieu of salary or 
other remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we 
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly 
fees. 

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced to us a total of 
$100,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These 
advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of 
March 31, 2012 and the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon 
the closing of this offering out of the $625,000 of offering proceeds that has 
been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial 
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering 
proceeds held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up 
to $500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business
combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender.
The warrants would be identical to the sponsor warrants. The terms of such 
loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no 
written agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

Unlike many blank check companies, if we seek stockholder approval of our 
initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection 
with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, prior to the 
consummation of our initial business combination, the investment management 
trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & 
Trust Company will permit the release to us from the trust account of amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares sold in this offering (1,500,000 
shares, or 1,725,000 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) at any time commencing after the filing of a preliminary 
proxy statement for our initial business combination and ending on the record 
date for the vote to be held to approve our initial business combination. 
Purchases will be made only in open market transactions at times when we are 
not in possession of any material non-public information and may not be made 
during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. It is 
intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, 
which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, 
including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases. If the 
conditions of Rule 10b-18, as in effect at the time we wish to make such 
purchases, are not satisfied, it is likely that we will not make such 
purchases. Any purchases we make will be at prices (inclusive of commissions) 
not to exceed the per-share amount then held in the trust account ($10.05 per 
share or approximately $10.02 per share if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option is exercised in full). We can purchase any or all of the 1,500,000 
shares (or 1,725,000 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) we are entitled to purchase. It will be entirely in our 
discretion as to how many shares are purchased. Purchasing decisions will be 
made based on various factors, including the then current market price of our 
common stock and the terms of the proposed business combination. All shares 
purchased by us will be immediately cancelled. Such open market purchases, if 
any, would be conducted by us to minimize any disparity between the then 
current market price of our common stock and the per-share amount held in the 
trust account. A market price below the per-share trust amount could provide an
incentive for purchasers to buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary 
proxy statement at a discount to the per-share amount held in the trust account
for the sole purpose of voting against our initial business combination and 
exercising redemption rights for the full per share amount held in the trust 
account. Such trading activity could enable such investors to block our initial
business combination by making it difficult for us to obtain the approval of 
such business combination by the vote of a majority of our outstanding common 
stock. 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, we may enter into privately negotiated transactions to 
purchase public shares from stockholders following consummation of the initial 
business combination with proceeds released to us from the trust account 
immediately following consummation of the initial business combination. Our 
sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates also may purchase 
shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the 
consummation of our initial business combination. Although we do not currently 
anticipate paying any premium purchase price (over the trust value) for such 
public shares, in the event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in the 
best interest of those stockholders not receiving any such premium. In 
addition, the payment of a premium by us after the consummation of our initial 
business combination may not be in the best interest of the remaining 
stockholders who do not redeem their shares. Such stockholders may experience a
reduction in book value per share compared to the value received by 
stockholders that have their shares purchased by us at a premium. Except for 
the limitations described above on use of trust proceeds released to us prior 
to consummating our initial business combination, there is no limit on the 
amount of shares that could be acquired by us or our affiliates, or the price 
we or they may pay, if we hold a stockholder vote. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our 
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption 
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial 
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption 
of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of common stock that
such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations 
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable 
to consummate our initial business combination within 21 months following the 
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described 
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) 
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other 
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind 
to or in the trust account. 

Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with 
respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the 
consummation of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial 
stockholders have agreed to waive their right to liquidating distributions with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business 
combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our
sponsor, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares 
in or after this offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating 
distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our 
initial business combination within the required time period."

the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common 
stock by the selling stockholders. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering primarily for 
general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing 
activities, general and administrative matters, and capital expenditures. 
We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire, invest in, or 
obtain rights to complementary technologies, solutions, or businesses. 
Our management will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds 
in this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, 
commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

offering price of $20.00 per share. Concurrently, we are selling to American 
Capital an aggregate of $40.0 million (or 2,000,000 shares) of our common stock 
at the initial public offering price in a private placement. The gross proceeds
from the sale of the shares sold in the concurrent private placement will not 
be subject to any underwriting discount or commissions payable by us. For all 
shares sold in this offering, including shares sold pursuant to the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option, but excluding the Reserved Shares and 
shares sold in the concurrent private placement, the underwriters will 
receive an underwriting fee of $0.80 per share payable by our Manager at 
closing or the applicable date of delivery. We estimate that the net proceeds
that we receive from this offering and the concurrent private placement will 
be approximately $199 million (or approximately $223 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), in each case 
after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by us of approximately
$875,000.  

We intend to deploy the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent 
private placement on a leveraged basis to invest in our targeted assets,
which include agency mortgage investments, non-agency mortgage investments
and other mortgage-related investments. 

Depending on the availability of the targeted investments, we may temporarily 
invest the net proceeds in readily marketable, short-term, interest-bearing 
investments, including money market accounts that are consistent with our 
intention to qualify as a REIT. These temporary investments are expected to
provide a lower net return than we hope to achieve from our target assets."

Creation Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading 
activities.  The Sponsor will invest the Fund’s assets in Sugar Futures 
Contracts, Cleared Sugar Swaps and Other Sugar Interests, short-term Treasury 
Securities, cash and cash equivalents.  When the Fund purchases Sugar 
Futures Contracts and certain Other Sugar Interests that are exchange-traded, 
the Fund will be required to deposit with the futures commission merchant on 
behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other 
interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under the Sugar 
Interests at maturity.  This deposit is known as initial margin.  
Counterparties in transactions in Cleared Sugar Swaps and over-the-counter 
Sugar Interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on the 
Fund.  The Sponsor will invest the Fund’s assets that remain after margin and
collateral is posted in short-term Treasury Securities, cash and/or cash 
equivalents.  Subject to these margin and collateral requirements, the 
Sponsor has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that will be: 
  
· held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other
  custodians;  

· used for other investments; and  

· held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.  

In general, the Fund expects that it will be required to post between 5% and 
10% of the notional amount of a Sugar Interest as initial margin when 
entering into such Sugar Interest.  Ongoing margin and collateral payments 
will generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter 
Sugar Interests based on changes in the value of the Sugar Interests.  
Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter 
Sugar Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall 
market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the 
ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Sugar Interest,
and each party’s creditworthiness.  In light of the differing requirements 
for initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Sugar 
Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral 
payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets 
will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time.  The Treasury 
Securities, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will constitute 
reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral 
requirements.  All interest income will be used for the Fund’s benefit. 
  
A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time.  Moreover, margin is merely
a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for 
any positions held.

Securities, cash and cash equivalents. When the Fund purchases Sugar Futures 
Contracts and certain Other Sugar Interests that are exchange-traded, the Fund 
will be required to deposit with the futures commission merchant on behalf of 
the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as 
security to ensure payment for the obligation under the Sugar Interests at 
maturity. This deposit is known as initial margin. Counterparties in 
transactions in Cleared Sugar Swaps and over-the-counter Sugar Interests will 
generally impose similar collateral requirements on the Fund. The Sponsor will 
invest the Fund’s assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in 
short-term Treasury Securities, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these 
margin and collateral requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine
the percentage of assets that will be: 
  
   ·  held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other 
      custodians;  

   ·  used for other investments; and  

   ·  held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.  

In general, the Fund expects that it will be required to post between 5% and 
10% of the notional amount of a Sugar Interest as initial margin when entering 
into such Sugar Interest. Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally
be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter Sugar Interests based
on changes in the value of the Sugar Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral
requirements with respect to over-the-counter Sugar Interests are negotiated by
the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of 
the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its
exposure under the Sugar Interest, and each party’s creditworthiness. In light 
of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and 
over-the-counter Sugar Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin 
and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of the 
Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The 
Treasury Securities, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will constitute
reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral 
requirements. All interest income will be used for the Fund’s benefit. 
  
A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a 
security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any 
positions held.

(1)  As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares, which 
could occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand for 
the shares or changes in market conditions following the commencement of the 
offering.  

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing 
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment 
but will result in a reduction of Home Federal’s deposits. The net proceeds 
may vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be more or 
less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a 
syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not 
purchased in the subscription and community offerings. 

Poage Bankshares may use the proceeds it retains from the stock 
offering: 

   •     to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase 
         shares of common stock in the stock offering; 
 
   •     to invest in investment securities, including obligations of state 
         and political subdivisions and securities issued by the Unites States 
         Government and United States Government-sponsored agencies or 
         entities; 
 
   •     to pay cash dividends to stockholders; 
 
   •     to repurchase shares of our common stock; and 
 
   •     for other general corporate purposes. 
 
With the exception of the funding of the loan to the employee stock ownership 
plan, Poage Bankshares has not quantified its plans for use of the offering 
proceeds for any of the foregoing purposes. Initially, we intend to invest a 
substantial portion of the net proceeds in short-term investments, investment-
grade debt obligations or mortgage-backed securities. 

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase 
shares of our common stock during the first year following the conversion, 
except to fund equity benefit plans other than stock options or except when 
extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory approval. 

Home Federal may use the net proceeds it receives from the stock 
offering: 

    •     to fund new loans; 
 
    •     to repay short-term borrowings; 
 
    •     to expand its banking franchise by establishing or acquiring new 
          branches, although we have no current plans to do so; 
 
    •     to invest in investment securities, including obligations of state 
          and political subdivisions and securities issued by the Unites States
          Government and United States Government-sponsored agencies or 
          entities; and 
 
    •     for other general corporate purposes. 
 
Home Federal has not quantified its plans for use of the offering proceeds for 
any of the foregoing purposes. Our short-term and long-term growth plans 
anticipate that, upon completion of the offering, we will experience growth 
through increased lending and expansion into new markets as opportunities 
arise, including through de novo branching, branch acquisitions or 
acquisitions of other financial institutions. We currently have no 
understandings or agreements to acquire any other financial institutions, 
branches of other financial institutions, or other financial services 
companies. 

Initially, the net proceeds Home Federal receives will be invested in short-
term investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed 
securities."

of $12.50 per share. We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this 
offering of approximately $60.9 million assuming the sale of the minimum number
of shares of common stock offered in this offering or approximately $99.7 
million assuming the sale of the maximum number of shares of common stock 
offered in this offering, after deducting selling commissions and dealer

 (1)  Includes repayment of start-up costs of $74,271 (as of March 31, 2011), 
      consisting of $12,771 for SEC registration fees, $11,500 for FINRA 
      registration fees and $50,000 for NASDAQ registration fees, previously 
      paid by our sponsor.  

 (2)  As part of our formation transactions, we anticipate refinancing the 
      mortgage indebtedness encumbering our 60 continuing properties leased to 
      Citizen’s Bank and our two TRS properties in the principal amount, as of 
      March 31, 2011, of approximately $82.6 million, with an interest rate of 
      6.3% per annum, and which matures in August 2011. In connection with this
      refinancing, we anticipate utilizing approximately $27.6 million of net 
      proceeds from this offering to repay this mortgage indebtedness with the 
      balance coming from a $55.0 million draw against our anticipated $63.0 
      million senior secured revolving acquisition facility.  

 (3)  In connection with our formation transactions, we will repay the 
      outstanding indebtedness on (i) unsecured debt owed by 28 of our property
      subsidiaries in the principal amount of approximately $19.4 million that 
      has a weighted average interest rate of 9.94% and matures on July 11, 
      2011 (subject to two one-year extension options) and (ii) unsecured debt 
      owed by one of our property subsidiaries in the principal amount of 
      approximately $11.2 million (together with prepayment penalties related 
      thereto in the amount of approximately $112,000) that has an interest 
      rate of 8.50% and matures on September 8, 2013.  

 (4)  Includes approximately $630,000 debt origination costs and related fees 
      associated with the anticipated senior secured revolving acquisition 
      facility, $112,000 of prepayment costs related to outstanding unsecured 
      debt, $295,000 in property transfer taxes relating to the transfer of 
      interests in our portfolio of properties to us and $150,000 debt transfer
      fees associated with the transfer of our Home Depot property to us 
      subject to its existing mortgage financing of approximately $13.85 
      million.  

 (5)  Represents a reserve for the payment of distributions in respect of OP 
      units during the one year period following the closing of this offering 
      at an annual rate of 7% to the extent our cash flows provided by our 
      operations are insufficient to fund these distributions. We estimate, on
      a pro forma basis, that our estimated cash available for the 12 months 
      ended March 31, 2011 would be $6,137,890 and the aggregate distributions 
      for that same period would equal $7,971,250, leaving a shortfall of 
      $1,833,360.  

 (6)  We expect a significant portion of this amount to be available to fund 
      the acquisition of new properties.  

Pending the use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in 
interest-bearing, short-term investment-grade securities, money-market accounts
or other investments which are consistent with our intention to elect and 
qualify to be taxed as a REIT. 

We do not intend to use any of the net proceeds from the offering to fund 
distributions to our stockholders, but to the extent we use the net proceeds to
fund distributions, these payments will be treated as a return of capital to 
our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes."

offering of approximately $60.9 million assuming the sale of the minimum number
of shares of common stock offered in this offering or approximately $99.7 
million assuming the sale of the maximum number of shares of common stock 
offered in this offering, after deducting selling commissions and dealer 
manager fees, and estimated expenses of the offering. We will contribute the 
net proceeds of this offering to our operating partnership in exchange for OP 
units. 

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and the estimated uses of 
funds that we expect in connection with this offering. Some of the uses 
indicated in the following table could be funded from other sources, such as 
additional cash on hand.

 (1)  Includes repayment of start-up costs of $74,271 (as of March 31, 2011), 
      consisting of $12,771 for SEC registration fees, $11,500 for FINRA 
      registration fees and $50,000 for NASDAQ registration fees, previously 
      paid by our sponsor.  

 (2)  As part of our formation transactions, we anticipate refinancing the 
      mortgage indebtedness encumbering our 60 continuing properties leased to 
      Citizen’s Bank and our two TRS properties in the principal amount, as of 
      March 31, 2011, of approximately $82.6 million, with an interest rate of 
      6.3% per annum, and which matures in August 2011. In connection with this
      refinancing, we anticipate utilizing approximately $27.6 million of net 
      proceeds from this offering to repay this mortgage indebtedness with the 
      balance coming from a $55.0 million draw against our anticipated $63.0 
      million senior secured revolving acquisition facility.  

 (3)  In connection with our formation transactions, we will repay the 
      outstanding indebtedness on (i) unsecured debt owed by 28 of our property
      subsidiaries in the principal amount of approximately $19.4 million that 
      has a weighted average interest rate of 9.94% and matures on July 11, 
      2011 (subject to two one-year extension options) and (ii) unsecured debt 
      owed by one of our property subsidiaries in the principal amount of 
      approximately $11.2 million (together with prepayment penalties related 
      thereto in the amount of approximately $112,000) that has an interest 
      rate of 8.50% and matures on September 8, 2013.  

 (4)  Includes approximately $630,000 debt origination costs and related fees 
      associated with the anticipated senior secured revolving acquisition 
      facility, $112,000 of prepayment costs related to outstanding unsecured 
      debt, $295,000 in property transfer taxes relating to the transfer of 
      interests in our portfolio of properties to us and $150,000 debt transfer
      fees associated with the transfer of our Home Depot property to us 
      subject to its existing mortgage financing of approximately $13.85 
      million.  

 (5)  Represents a reserve for the payment of distributions in respect of OP 
      units during the one year period following the closing of this offering 
      at an annual rate of 7% to the extent our cash flows provided by our 
      operations are insufficient to fund these distributions. We estimate, on
      a pro forma basis, that our estimated cash available for the 12 months 
      ended March 31, 2011 would be $6,137,890 and the aggregate distributions 
      for that same period would equal $7,971,250, leaving a shortfall of 
      $1,833,360.  

 (6)  We expect a significant portion of this amount to be available to fund 
      the acquisition of new properties.  

Pending the use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in 
interest-bearing, short-term investment-grade securities, money-market accounts
or other investments which are consistent with our intention to elect and 
qualify to be taxed as a REIT. 

We do not intend to use any of the net proceeds from the offering to fund 
distributions to our stockholders, but to the extent we use the net proceeds to
fund distributions, these payments will be treated as a return of capital to 
our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes."

common stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $76.6 
million, based on the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share, after 
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised 
in full, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $89.3 
million. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares 
offered by the selling stockholders. 

Of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering, we expect to use 
up to $7.0 million to pay our remaining milestone obligations to the General 
Hospital Corporation, a not-for-profit Massachusetts corporation, which owns 
and operates MGH. We are obligated to make two milestone payments to MGH 
including (i) $1 million due upon achieving cumulative net sales (as defined in
our agreement with MGH) of $70 million and (ii) $6 million due upon the earlier
to occur of achieving cumulative net sales of $200 million or the completion of
this offering. In lieu of a cash payment, MGH may elect to receive up to 50% of
each of the remaining milestone payments in our common stock, subject to a cap 
of 3.5% of our common stock on a fully-diluted basis. 

We intend to use the remainder of our net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes. Our primary purpose for pursuing this offering is to raise funds to 
support the further commercialization of CoolSculpting. As a result, we intend 
to prioritize our future expenditures on expanding our North American and 
international sales and distribution infrastructure, expanding our planned 
physician and consumer marketing initiatives, expanding our FDA-cleared 
indications for CoolSculpting, and obtaining additional regulatory approvals 
for CoolSculpting in key international markets. We also intend to use our 
remaining net proceeds to support our planned research and product development 
activities, including improving and enhancing the CoolSculpting System and the 
CoolSculpting procedure and exploring the development of additional aesthetic 
products utilizing our proprietary controlled-cooling technology platform. We 
also may use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire complementary products, 
technologies, or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or 
commitments to complete any such transaction and are not involved in 
negotiations to do so. Other than the payment of our remaining milestone 
obligations to MGH, we have not yet identified the amounts we plan to spend on 
each of these areas or the timing of the expenditures. Accordingly, our 
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, 
and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the 
application of the proceeds in this offering. The amounts that we actually 
spend for the purposes described above may vary significantly and will depend, 
in part, on the timing and amount of our future revenue, our future expenses, 
and any future acquisitions that we may propose. Pending these uses, we plan to
invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade securities."

(1) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares, which
    could occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand
    for the shares or changes in market conditions following the commencement
    of the offering.

(2) Assumes all shares of common stock are sold in the subscription offering
    and/or the community offering. 

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing 
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment 
but will result in a reduction of Belmont Savings Bank’s deposits. The net 
proceeds may vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be
more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if 
a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not 
purchased in the subscription and community offerings.

BSB Bancorp, Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the stock offering:

• to invest in mortgage-backed securities and debt securities issued by the
  United States Government and United States Government-sponsored agencies or
  entities;

• to finance the acquisition of financial institutions or other financial
  service companies or the deposits and assets of other institutions
  (although we currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other
  banks, thrifts, branches thereof or other financial services companies);
  and

• to pay cash dividends to stockholders;

• to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to regulatory
  restrictions; and

• for other general corporate purposes, including depositing such funds with,
  or making additional capital contributions to, Belmont Savings Bank.

With the exception of the funding of the loan to the employee stock ownership
plan (or funding a subsidiary which will make this loan), BSB Bancorp, Inc. 
has not quantified its plans for use of the offering proceeds for each of 
the foregoing purposes. Initially, we intend to invest a substantial portion 
of the net proceeds in short-term corporate debt securities, U.S. government 
and agency obligations, and mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed 
by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.

Under applicable banking regulations, we may not repurchase shares of our 
common stock during the first year following the conversion, except to fund 
equity benefit plans or except when extraordinary circumstances exist and 
with prior regulatory approval.

Belmont Savings Bank may use the proceeds it receives from the stock offering:

• to fund new loans;

• to invest in securities permitted by our investment policy;

• to expand its banking franchise by establishing or acquiring new branches,
  or by acquiring other financial institutions, or the deposits and assets of
  other institutions, including in FDIC-assisted transactions of failed
  institutions, or other financial services companies (although we currently
  have no understandings or agreements to acquire other banks, thrifts,
  branches thereof or other financial services companies). Depending on
  market conditions, we intend to expand our branch office network by at least
  two de novo or acquired branch offices over the next four years;

• to prepay outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances; and

• for other general corporate purposes. 

Belmont Savings Bank has not quantified its plans or determined specific 
amounts for use of the offering proceeds for each of the foregoing purposes. 
We expect that a substantial portion of the proceeds will initially be 
invested in short-term investments, U.S. Government Agency securities and 
mortgage-backed securities. The use of proceeds outlined above are based on 
many factors including but not limited to changes in market interest rates,
our relative position in the financial services industry in our market and 
the attractiveness of potential acquisition of other financial institutions
or their assets. Our short-term and long-term growth plans anticipate that, 
upon completion of the offering, we will experience growth through increased 
lending and investment activities and, possibly, acquisitions. We currently 
have no understandings or agreements to acquire other banks, thrifts, branches
thereof or other financial services companies. There can be no assurance that 
we would be able to consummate any acquisition."

approximately $36.8 million from our sale of 4,920,000 shares of our Common 
Stock in this offering, after deducting estimated unpaid offering expenses
of approximately $2.1 million and the underwriting discounts and commissions 
payable to the underwriters. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $42.7
million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering (i) to facilitate our 
growth strategy by, among other things, advancing our development and 
production of animated and VFX-driven feature films and building our 
for-profit education business through development of DDI, to the extent not 
funded from third-party sources as we currently anticipate, as well 
as (ii) for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

This anticipated use of net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts 
and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on 
numerous factors, including, among other things, the anticipated benefits 
and risks associated with our business and growth strategies; our ability to 
expand into the visual effects-driven and animated feature film production 
business and the for-profit education business; the anticipated size or 
trends of the markets in which we compete and the anticipated competition in 
those markets; our ability to attract customers and to attract and retain 
qualified management and technical personnel; and our future capital
requirements. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in using 
the net proceeds of this offering. 

Following this offering, we believe that our available funds will be 
sufficient to allow us to advance our growth strategy. However, it is
possible that we will not achieve the progress that we expect because the 
actual costs, timing of development and effects of competition are difficult 
to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays. We have no 
committed external sources of funds. To the extent that the net proceeds from 
this offering and our other capital resources are insufficient to serve the 
purposes stated herein, we will need to finance our cash needs through public 
or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaboration and 
licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives. 

Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the 
funds in cash, cash equivalents (which may include Treasury Bills, 
certificates of deposit, money market accounts, money market mutual funds, 
and other liquid investments), or short-term investment grade securities."

We intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering for working
capital and other general corporate purposes.

the termination of our royalty obligations under an existing license agreement,
we have an obligation to issue a promissory note to Symyx Technologies, Inc.

this offering. Such note will have a principal amount equal to $27.3 million 
and will have a term of 24 months and an interest rate equal to 4%. Such note 
will be payable in an amount equal to the lesser of the principal amount and 
the greater of $500,000 per quarter or the amount of accrued interest, with a 
balloon payment at maturity if applicable. Such note will also be pre-payable 
by us at any time without penalty or premium, and will be secured by tangible 
personal property, excluding intellectual property. A portion of the net 
proceeds of this offering will be used to make payments of scheduled interest 
and payment of principal at any time at or prior to maturity. We have also 
agreed to reimburse Symyx for 50% of their underwriting discounts and 
commissions, which amount is equal to $1.4 million. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to expand our current business 
through acquisitions of other businesses, products, intellectual property or 
technologies. Other than as set forth above, we do not have agreements or 
commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time.

investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or director or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government. We cannot predict whether the proceeds 
invested will yield a favorable return, if any."

offering at the initial public offering price of $19.00 per share are estimated
to be $95.2 million, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and 
offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of this 
offering to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the 2009 Loan Facility 
(an aggregate principal amount of $84.4 million was outstanding as of August 
2, 2011), to pay $1.4 million in the aggregate of accrued management fees and 
interest thereon and a related termination fee, and to use the remainder for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including possible 
acquisitions. If the underwriters exercise in full the over-allotment option, 
$4.4 million of the net proceeds will be used to repay the principal and 
accrued interest (as of August 2, 2011) of the outstanding PIK Notes 
substantially concurrent with the closing of the over-allotment option. 

The interest rate applicable to the 2009 Loan Facility is 16% per year, and it 
matures on January 18, 2015. The interest rate applicable to the PIK Notes is 
12% per year, and they mature at various times from October 24, 2012 through 
March 19, 2015. 

From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate possible 
acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses that are complementary to our 
business. We currently have no arrangements, agreements or understandings for 
any such acquisitions or investments, and have not identified any businesses 
that we currently intend to acquire or with respect to which we currently 
intend to use the proceeds of this offering.

Manning & Napier intends to use approximately $28.9 million of the net 
proceeds from this offering to purchase Class A units of Manning & Napier 
Group from Manning & Napier Group, which in turn expects to use such net 
proceeds for general corporate purposes and strategic growth opportunities,
including potential acquisitions and product seeding. However, as of the 
date of this prospectus, Manning & Napier Group has no agreement relating

use approximately $105.7 million of the net proceeds from this offering to

us will be approximately $72.2 million, or approximately $88.2 million if the 
underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the 
selling stockholders. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
common stock, obtain additional capital, facilitate our future access to the 
public equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential 
customers and improve our competitive position. We anticipate that we will 
use the net proceeds of this offering to fund our advertising strategy to 
drive membership growth and for general corporate purposes, including working 
capital. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire, invest in 
or obtain rights to complementary technologies, products, services or 
businesses. There are no such transactions under consideration at this time. 
Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds in 
this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of 
this offering in short-term, interest-bearing investment-grade securities or

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we 
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $139.4 million, 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable
by us. 
  
The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and 
to facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We anticipate
that we will use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 
  
• approximately $50.0 million to fund our clinical trials and other
 development activities related to CO-101;  
   
• approximately $25.0 million to fund our clinical trials and other
 development activities related to CO-1686;  
   
• approximately $30.0 million to fund our clinical trials and other
 development activities related to CO-338; and  
   
• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.  

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe 
that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash 
equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our 
operations for at least the next 12 months. In particular, we believe the 
net proceeds from this offering intended for clinical development and our 
existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be 
sufficient to fund our clinical development efforts through the following 
events: 
  
• completion of our LEAP trial of CO-101;  
   
• completion of our Phase II trial of CO-101 as a second-line treatment for
 pancreatic cancer patients with an absence of hENT1 expression;  
   
• completion of the dose ranging portion of our Phase I/II trials of CO-338
 as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in solid tumors; and  
   
• filing of an IND and initiation of our Phase I/II trial of CO-1686 in NSCLC.  

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts 
and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including 
the ongoing status of and results from clinical trials and other studies, as 
well as any strategic partnerships that we may enter into with third parties 
for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, 
management will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this 
offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this 
offering in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade securities, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the 
U.S. government."

shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders if the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional shares, although we will pay 
the expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, associated 
with the sale of those shares. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital, 
capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. We may also use 
a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products 
or technologies. However, we do not have negotiations underway, agreements 
reached or commitments made for any specific acquisitions at this time. 

Pending any use, as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in 
a variety of capital preservation instruments, including short- and 
long-term interest-bearing investments, direct or guaranteed obligations of 
the U.S. government, certificates of deposit and money market funds."

Creation Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading

Copper Futures Contracts and Other Copper-Related Investments, Treasuries, 
cash and cash equivalents. When the Fund purchases Benchmark Component Copper 
Futures Contracts and certain Other Copper-Related Investments that are 
exchange-traded, the Fund will be required to deposit with the futures 
commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the 
contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation 
under the Copper Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial 
margin. Counterparties in transactions in over-the-counter Copper Interests 
will generally impose similar collateral requirements on the Fund. The 
Sponsor will invest the Fund’s assets that remain after margin and collateral 
is posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these 
margin and collateral requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to 
determine the percentage of assets that will be: 

• held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other
  custodians;  
• used for other investments; and  
• held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.  

In general, the Fund expects that it will be required to post between 5% to 
20% of the notional amount of a Copper Interest as initial margin when
entering into the Copper Interest. Ongoing margin and collateral payments 
will generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter 
Copper Interests based on changes in the value of the Copper Interests. 
Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter 
Copper Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall
market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the 
ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Copper Interest, 
and each party’s creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for 
initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Copper Interests 
and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is 
not possible to estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted as 
margin or collateral at any given time. The Treasuries, cash and cash 
equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available 
to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will 
be used for the Fund’s benefit. 

A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely 
a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any

exchange-traded, the Fund will be required to deposit with the futures 
commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the 
contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation 
under the Copper Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial 
margin. Counterparties in transactions in over-the-counter Copper Interests 
will generally impose similar collateral requirements on the Fund. The 
Sponsor will invest the Fund’s assets that remain after margin and collateral 
is posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these 
margin and collateral requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to 
determine the percentage of assets that will be: 

• held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other
  custodians;  
• used for other investments; and  
• held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.  

In general, the Fund expects that it will be required to post between 5% to 
20% of the notional amount of a Copper Interest as initial margin when
entering into the Copper Interest. Ongoing margin and collateral payments 
will generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter 
Copper Interests based on changes in the value of the Copper Interests. 
Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter 
Copper Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall
market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the 
ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Copper Interest, 
and each party’s creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for 
initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Copper Interests 
and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is 
not possible to estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted as 
margin or collateral at any given time. The Treasuries, cash and cash 
equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available 
to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will 
be used for the Fund’s benefit. 

A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely 
a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any 
positions held. 

The assets of the Fund posted as margin for Benchmark Component Copper Futures
Contracts will be held in segregation pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act

Creation Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading 
activities. The Sponsor will invest the Fund’s assets in Benchmark Component 
Copper Futures Contracts and Other Copper-Related Investments, Treasuries, 
cash and cash equivalents. When the Fund purchases Benchmark Component Copper 
Futures Contracts and certain Other Copper-Related Investments that are 
exchange-traded, the Fund will be required to deposit with the futures 
commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the 
contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation 
under the Copper Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial 
margin. Counterparties in transactions in over-the-counter Copper Interests 
will generally impose similar collateral requirements on the Fund. The 
Sponsor will invest the Fund’s assets that remain after margin and collateral 
is posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these 
margin and collateral requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to 
determine the percentage of assets that will be: 

• held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other
  custodians;  
• used for other investments; and  
• held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.  

In general, the Fund expects that it will be required to post between 5% to 
20% of the notional amount of a Copper Interest as initial margin when
entering into the Copper Interest. Ongoing margin and collateral payments 
will generally be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter 
Copper Interests based on changes in the value of the Copper Interests. 
Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over-the-counter 
Copper Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall
market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the 
ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Copper Interest, 
and each party’s creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for 
initial payments under exchange-traded and over-the-counter Copper Interests 
and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is 
not possible to estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted as 
margin or collateral at any given time. The Treasuries, cash and cash 
equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available 
to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will 
be used for the Fund’s benefit. 

A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely 
a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any 
positions held.

shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $37.5 million 
(or approximately $43.5 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to 
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use 
approximately $12.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund to
 completion our Phase 3 clinical trial and related development activities for 
HyperAcute Pancreas, approximately $18.0 million to fund clinical and related 
development activities for our other HyperAcute immunotherapy product 
candidates, approximately $5.0 million to fund clinical and related 
development activities for our IDO pathway inhibitor product candidates and 
the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our 
other HyperAcute immunotherapy product candidates have either started or
completed Phase 1 clinical trials or completed the patient enrollment portion 
of Phase 2 clinical studies. Our IDO pathway inhibitor product candidates are 
in Phase 1 clinical trials and in multiple Phase 1/2 clinical trials. We 
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund the completion of 
each of these ongoing studies. Although it is difficult to predict future 
liquidity requirements, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering, 
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable 
securities, will allow us to fund our operations through at least the end of 
2013. 

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing 
of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the ongoing 
status and enrollment and site participation rates of, standard of care 
applicable to and results from clinical trials and other studies, as well 
as any strategic collaborations that we may enter into with third parties 
for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net 
proceeds from this offering. 

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade and interest-bearing instruments."

payable by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our visibility in the 
marketplace and create a liquid public market in the United States for our 
common shares. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with 
certainty all of the particular uses for these proceeds or the amounts that 
we plan to use for any particular purpose. Accordingly, our management team

the underwriters’ over-allotment option, primarily for general corporate 
purposes, which may include working capital, general and administrative 
matters and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of these proceeds

our option with SHI, although we have not made any determination with respect

approximately $167.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
a structuring fee, together with borrowings of approximately $155.8 million 
that we will incur upon the closing of this offering under our new revolving 
credit facility, to: 

• make cash distributions and payments to Fund I of approximately $289.9
 million; 

• repay in full approximately $27.3 million of LRR A's debt that we will
 assume at closing; 

• pay fees and expenses of approximately $1.9 million relating to our new
 credit facility; and 

• pay estimated offering expenses of approximately $3.9 million. 

Other than the $155.8 million that we expect to borrow under our new revolving
credit facility upon the closing of this offering, we have no plans to 
immediately draw down additional borrowings under our new revolving credit 
facility. 

All of LRR A's debt that we will assume and repay in full at closing was
incurred under LRR A' s credit facility in connection with acquisitions. 
Such debt is secured by mortgages on substantially all of LRR A's oil and 
natural gas properties, including the Partnership Properties. The interest 
rate on this credit facility is 2.81% through November 23, 2011, and the
credit facility matures in November 2014.

(1) If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common
 units in full, the gross proceeds would be $205.6 million and the total
 distribution and payment to Fund I would be approximately $315.0 million. 

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the 
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the 
remainder, if any, will be issued to Fund I. Any such common units issued to 
Fund I will be issued for no consideration other than Fund I's contribution 
of the Partnership Properties to us in connection with the closing of this 
offering. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 1,411,200 
additional common units in full, the additional net proceeds would be 
approximately $25.1 million. The net proceeds from any exercise of such 
option will be used to pay additional cash consideration for the Partnership 
Properties purchased from Fund I and to make an additional cash distribution 
to Fund I. If the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase 
1,411,200 additional common units, we will issue 1,411,200 common units to
Fund I upon the expiration of the option. We will not receive any additional
consideration from Fund I in connection with such issuance. Accordingly, 
the exercise of the underwriters' option will not affect the total number 
of common units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum 
quarterly distribution on all units."

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to

any acquisitions at this time. 

We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds

 (1)  A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee 
      and FINRA filing fee, has been paid from loans in the aggregate amount of
      $160,500 ($45,500 of which was loaned to us subsequent to June 30, 2011) 
      made to us by our sponsor, Selway Capital Holdings, LLC, as further 
      described below. These funds will be repaid out of the net proceeds of 
      this offering not being deposited in the trust account upon consummation 
      of this offering.  

 (2)  Represents 2.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of 2,000,000 units in
      this offering. No up-front fee will be paid to the underwriters for any 
      units sold pursuant to the over-allotment option.  

 (3)  Represents 2.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of 2,000,000 units 
      ($400,000) in this offering, that will be deposited into the trust 
      account and paid to the underwriters only upon the later of a 
      consummation of an acquisition transaction, post-acquisition tender offer
      or post-acquisition automatic trust liquidation, and then only with 
      respect to those units as to which the component shares have not been 
      redeemed. If an acquisition transaction is not consummated and our 
      company is dissolved and the trust account is liquidated, such amounts 
      will be distributed among our public shareholders. In addition, in the 
      event of an acquisition transaction or a post-acquisition tender offer, 
      as the case may be, the amount of deferred underwriting discount payable 
      to the underwriters will be paid out first over other amounts in the 
      trust account.  

 (4)  If an acquisition transaction is consummated, we will owe Loeb & Loeb LLP
      $100,000 at the closing of the acquisition transaction. We have recorded 
      this amount as a liability. We shall pay this fee from our expense 
      budget, interest we earn on the trust or potentially from other capital 
      we may raise, but not from proceeds held in trust.  

 (5)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the sale of the 
      placement warrants. For purposes of presentation, the current portion of 
      underwriting discounts and commissions are reflected as the amount 
      payable to the underwriters upon consummation of the offering. An 
      additional $400,000, or $460,000 if the over-allotment option is 
      exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in the trust account 
      following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the 
      underwriters only on the later of the consummation of an acquisition 
      transaction or a post-acquisition tender offer, and then only with 
      respect to those units as to which the component shares of common stock 
      have not been redeemed for cash.  

 (6)  The amount of funds placed in the trust account and the pro rata share of
      the trust account will vary depending on how many units are sold pursuant
      to the over-allotment option.  

 (7)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
      all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.  

 (8)  The amount available to us for expenses and working capital will be the 
      same regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised. In the
      event that our operating expenses exceed the working capital available to
      us from net proceeds not held in trust account and interest earned on 
      monies held in the trust account (any amounts in the trust account in 
      excess of a maximum of $10.30 per public share, or a minimum of $10.26 
      per public share if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), our 
      founders may fund any working capital requirements through loans to be 
      paid back upon the consummation of an acquisition transaction.  

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Selway Capital 
Holdings, LLC has committed to purchase the placement warrants from us for an 
aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,750,000. These purchases will take
place on a private placement basis immediately prior to the consummation of 
this offering. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the
purchase of the placement warrants. A portion of the proceeds we receive from 
this purchase will be placed in the trust account described below. 

A total of approximately $20,600,000 (or approximately $23,600,000 if the over-
allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering 
and the sale of the placement warrants described in this prospectus, including 
$400,000 (or $460,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of 
deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, will be placed in a trust 
account at Wells Fargo Investments with American Stock Transfer & Trust 
Company, LLC as trustee. Net proceeds of this offering in the amount of 
$220,000 will not be held in the trust account. We believe the $220,000 of 
proceeds of this offering initially available to us outside of the trust 
account, together with the interest income on the balance of the trust account 
(any amounts in the trust account in excess of a maximum of $10.30 per public 
share, or a minimum of $10.26 if the over-allotment option is exercised in 
full) to be released to us from time to time for working capital requirements, 
will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 18 months, 
assuming an acquisition transaction is not completed during that time. The per 
unit amount in the trust account will be less than $10.30 in the event the 
underwriters exercise the over-allotment option because the underwriters’ 
discount is based on a percentage of the aggregate offering price, while other 
offering costs and the proceeds from the sale of the placement warrants are 
fixed, regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised. 

Except for any amounts paid to redeeming shareholders in connection with our 
initial acquisition transaction, the proceeds held in the trust account will 
not be released from the trust account until the consolidation of each series 
of our common stock into one class of common stock after consummation of an 
acquisition transaction, a post-acquisition tender offer, post-acquisition 
automatic trust liquidation or our dissolution and the liquidation of the trust
account in the event we do not consummate an acquisition transaction prior to 
18 months following the consummation of this offering. All amounts held in the 
trust account that are not: 

 •  distributed to public shareholders who exercise redemption rights;  

 •  released to us for working capital purposes and general corporate 
    requirements (any amount in the trust account in excess of a maximum of 
    $10.30 per public share, or a minimum of $10.26 per public share if the 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full);  

 •  released to us to pay taxes; or  

 •  payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting discounts and 
    commissions,  

will be released to us upon the later of the consummation of our initial 
acquisition transaction or post-acquisition tender offer. 

The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the 
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be 
used to finance operations of the target business. 

We anticipate structuring an acquisition transaction to acquire 100% of the 
equity interests or assets of the target business. We may, however, structure 
an acquisition transaction to acquire less than 100% of such interests or 
assets of the target business, but we will not acquire less than a controlling 
interest and will in all instances be the controlling shareholder of the target
company. The key factors that we will rely on in determining controlling 
shareholder status would be our acquisition of more than 50% of the voting 
rights of the target company and control of the majority of any governing body 
of the target company. Our certificate of incorporation requires that we 
acquire a controlling interest in a target business in connection with an 
acquisition transaction. We will not consider any transaction that does not 
meet such criteria. 

Upon release of funds from the trust account, and after payment of the 
redemption price to any public shareholders who exercise their redemption 
rights and the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to the 
underwriters, the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay
all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which
our initial acquisition transaction occurs. If the initial acquisition 
transaction is paid for using equity or debt securities or additional funds 
from a private offering of debt or equity securities or borrowings, we may 
apply the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate 
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the acquired 
business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on 
indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial acquisition transaction, to 
fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital. 

Selway Capital Holdings, LLC, our sole shareholder, has loaned us a total of 
$160,500 ($45,500 of which was loaned to us subsequent to June 30, 2011), which
amount was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in
the line items above related to the SEC registration fee, the FINRA filing fee 
and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans will be 
payable without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loans will 
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. 

We have agreed to pay to Selway Capital LLC a total of $5,000 per month for up 
to six months for office space, administrative services and secretarial 
support for a period commencing on the date of this prospectus and ending on 
the earlier of our distribution or liquidation of the trust account or 6 months
following the date of this prospectus. Selway Capital LLC has agreed to 
continue to provide office space, administrative services and secretarial 
support without further payment until our distribution or liquidation of the 
trust account if we have not completed an acquisition transaction and 
distributed or liquidated the trust account prior to the end of such 6 month 
period. Selway Capital LLC is an affiliate of certain of our officers and 
directors, namely Messrs. Eitan and Gonzalez. This arrangement was agreed to by
Selway Capital LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide Messrs. Eitan
and Gonzalez compensation in lieu of a management fee or other remuneration 
because it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid by Selway Capital LLC 
will approximate the monthly reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at 
least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon 
consummation of an acquisition transaction or 6 months following the 
consummation of this offering, we will cease paying these monthly fees. 

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income 
that may be released to us (all amounts in the trust account in excess of a 
maximum of $10.30 per share, or a minimum of $10.26 per share if the over-
allotment option is exercised in full) and will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated for up to 18 months. Our 
estimates are based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken 
only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other 
preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an acquisition transaction. 
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence 
and negotiating an acquisition transaction is lower than the actual amount 
necessary to do so, or in the event the amounts not held in the trust account 
is insufficient to pay our costs and expenses, we may be required to raise 
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable, through loans or additional investments from our sponsor or 
our officers and directors. None of our founders is under any obligation to 
advance funds to, or invest in, us. 

The net proceeds from this offering and the private placement of the placement 
warrants that are not immediately required for the purposes set forth above 
will be invested only in U.S. “government securities” (as such term is defined 
in the Investment Company Act) and/or one or more money market funds, selected 
by us, which invest principally in either short-term securities issued or 
guaranteed by the United States having a rating in the highest investment 
category granted thereby by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of 
acquisition or short-term municipal bonds issued by governmental entities 
located within the United States, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. 

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, we will not pay fees of any kind (including finder’s and 
consulting fees) to any of our officers and directors, or any of their 
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the 
consummation of the acquisition transaction. However, our officers and 
directors and their respective affiliates will receive reimbursement for any 
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with 
identifying, investigating and consummating a potential acquisition transaction
with one of more target businesses. There are no limitations on the amount of 
expenses for which they can seek reimbursement, provided such expenses were 
incurred for our benefit. We expect that due diligence of prospective target 
businesses will be monitored or performed by Messrs. Eitan and Gonzalez. 
Additionally, we may engage market research firms and/or third-party 
consultants. Our board of directors will have the responsibility of reviewing 
and approving all expense reimbursements made to our founders and their 
affiliates, with any interested director or directors abstaining from such 
review and approval. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available 
proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would 
not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an acquisition transaction. These 
expenses would be a liability of the post-transaction business and would be 
treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined 
business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such acquisition 
transaction, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If 
the target business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause 
our directors to view such potential acquisition transaction unfavorably and 
result in a conflict of interest. Although we currently expect it is possible 
that the members of our management team will become a part of the management 
team of the combined entity, since the actual role of each present member of 
management after an acquisition transaction is uncertain, we have no current 
ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons 
after an acquisition transaction. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only (i) upon our dissolution and trust account liquidation if we are unable to
consummate an acquisition transaction within the allotted time, (ii) if the 
public shareholder seeks to have us redeem their shares for cash in connection 
with an acquisition transaction that was actually consummated, or (iii) we 
effect a post-acquisition automatic trust liquidation. In no other 
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind 
in or to the funds in the trust account. 

Upon the consolidation of each series of our common stock into one class of 
common stock after consummation of an acquisition transaction or post-
acquisition tender offer, as the case may be, the underwriters will receive the
deferred underwriting discounts and commissions held in the trust account. The 
underwriters will not receive the deferred underwriting discount with respect 
to those units as to which the component shares of common stock have been 
redeemed for cash. If we do not complete an initial acquisition transaction and
we dissolve and the trust account is liquidated and distributed to our public 
shareholders as described herein, the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit 
any rights or claims to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, 
together with any accrued interest thereon, in the trust account and (ii) that 
the trustee is authorized to distribute the deferred underwriting discounts 
and commissions, together with any accrued interest thereon, net of taxes 
payable, and net of interest income earned on the trust account previously 
released to us to fund our working capital and general corporate requirements, 
to the public shareholders."

underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated expenses of this 
offering, will be approximately $275.0 million (based on an assumed initial 
public offering price of $20.00 per common unit, the mid-point of the price 
range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus). We intend to use: 

   •     approximately $150.8 million of the net proceeds of this offering to 
         make a capital contribution to REMC for the repayment in full and 
         termination of REMC’s existing term loan and the payment of related 
         fees and expenses; 

   •     approximately $39.8 million of the net proceeds of this offering to 
         make a distribution to RNHI to reimburse it for expenditures made by 
         REMC during the two-year period preceding this offering for the 
         expansion and improvement of our facility, including expenditures for 
         preliminary work relating to our expansion projects; for federal 
         income tax purposes, when REMC converts to a limited liability company
         RNHI is treated as having been the party that made such expenditures 
         with respect to our facility; 
 
   •     approximately $1.8 million for the payment of expenditures related to 
         the replacement of our steam methane reformer tubes; 

   •     approximately $5.7 million for the payment of expenditures related to 
         our urea expansion and DEF build-out project; 
 
   •     approximately $0.6 million for the payment of expenditures related to 
         FEED for our ammonia capacity expansion project; 
 
   •     approximately $40.0 million for general working capital purposes; and
 
   •     the balance of the net proceeds of this offering to make a 
         distribution to RNHI. 
 
We will require additional debt and/or equity financing to complete our ammonia
capacity expansion project, which could cost approximately $100 million to 
complete based on preliminary estimates.

Borrowings under the existing term loan bear interest at a variable rate based 
upon either LIBOR with a 1.5% minimum or the lenders’ alternative base rate 
with a 2.5% minimum, plus in each case an applicable margin. As of June 30, 
2011, we had $150.0 million outstanding under our current term loan and the 
applicable interest rate was 10.0% per annum. The maturity date of the existing
term loan is June 10, 2016. REMC used the proceeds of the existing term loan 
plus approximately $20.4 million of cash on hand to repay the outstanding 
obligations and prepayment penalties under REMC’s previous credit agreement in 
an amount of approximately $95.7 million, to pay a dividend to Rentech of 
approximately $67.0 million and to pay related fees and expenses of 
approximately $7.7 million.

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase up to 2,250,000 
additional common units in full, the additional net proceeds would be 
approximately $41.9 million (and the total net proceeds to us would be 
approximately $316.9 million), in each case assuming an initial public offering
price per common unit of $20.00. The net proceeds from any exercise of such 
option will be used to redeem from RNHI, at the same price per unit as the 
common units sold to the public in this offering, less underwriting discounts 
and commissions, a number of common units equal to the number of additional 
common units purchased by the underwriters pursuant to such exercise. 

A $1.00 increase (or decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of 
$20.00 per common unit would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from 
this offering by $14.0 million, assuming the number of common units offered by 
us remains the same and assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option 
to purchase additional common units, and after deducting the underwriting 
discounts and commissions. Any increase or decrease in the initial public 
offering price will result in a corresponding adjustment to the second 
distribution to RNHI described above. The actual initial public offering price 
is subject to market conditions and negotiations between us and the 
underwriters. 

Depending on market conditions at the time of pricing of this offering and 
other considerations, we may sell fewer or more common units than the number 
set forth on the cover page of this prospectus."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $649.8 million, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering

shares of Class A common stock in this offering is exercised in full, we 
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $748.5 million, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of 
the particular uses for the net proceeds of this offering. However, we 
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, which may include the acquisition of other
businesses, products or technologies; however, we do not have any commitments 
for any acquisitions at this time. Based on our current cash and cash 
equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, we do not expect 
that we will utilize any of the net proceeds of this offering to fund 
operations, including online marketing expenses, during the next twelve 
months. We will have broad discretion in the way we use the net proceeds.
Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in money market funds and investment grade debt securities."

Enduro Sponsor maintains a $500 million senior secured credit agreement, which 
provides for revolving loans. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
have a maturity date of December 1, 2015 and bear interest at the applicable 
LIBOR rate, plus applicable margins ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%, or at a base 
rate, plus applicable margins ranging from 0.75% to 1.75%. The base rate is 
calculated as the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds 
effective rate plus 0.5%, and (c) the one-month LIBOR plus 1%. 
  
As of October 10, 2011, total borrowings under Enduro Sponsor’s revolving 
credit facility were $232 million. For the first half of 2011, the weighted 
average interest rate was approximately 3.2%. The current borrowings under the 
revolving credit facility were incurred to fund the acquisition of the Acquired
Properties. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters participating in this 
offering are lenders under Enduro Sponsor’s senior secured credit agreement and
will receive a substantial portion of the proceeds from this offering pursuant 
to the repayment of a portion of the borrowings thereunder."

The borrowings under our promissory note, which we will assume from NRGY 
immediately prior to the closing of this offering, will be incurred by NRGY to 
repay, repurchase or redeem existing debt of NRGY. We will assume the 
promissory note as partial consideration to NRGY in connection with the 
recapitalization of its interest in us. Our promissory note will mature at 5:00
p.m. (Chicago time) on the closing date of this offering. We expect borrowings 
under our promissory note will bear interest at a rate equal to JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A.’s prime rate plus 5%. 

We expect borrowings under our revolving credit facility to initially bear 
interest at approximately 3.25%. Our revolving credit facility will mature five
years from the closing date of this offering. 
  
If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase all or 
a portion of the 2,400,000 additional common units, the number of common units 
purchased by the underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the 
public and the remainder of the 2,400,000 additional common units, if any, will
be issued to NRGY. Any such units issued to NRGY will be issued for no 
additional consideration. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
2,400,000 additional common units in full, the additional net proceeds would be
approximately $38.2 million. The net proceeds from any exercise of the 
underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units will be distributed to
NRGY, and we expect that NRGY will use substantially all such net proceeds to 
repay outstanding borrowings under NRGY’s revolving credit facility. Borrowings
under NRGY’s revolving credit facility were incurred to fund the acquisition of
the Seneca Lake facility, to fund the construction of the MARC I pipeline and 
North/South expansion project and for NRGY’s working capital needs. As of 
November 30, 2011, borrowings under NRGY’s revolving credit facility had a 
weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.85%. NRGY’s revolving credit 
facility matures on July 28, 2016. If the underwriters do not exercise their 
option to purchase additional common units, we will issue 2,400,000 common 
units to NRGY upon the option’s expiration. We will not receive any additional 
consideration from NRGY in connection with such issuance. Accordingly, the 
exercise of the underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of common
units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the initial quarterly 
distribution on all common units. 

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, is the 
holder of our promissory note and will, in that respect, receive all or 
substantially all of the net proceeds from this offering in connection with the
repayment in full of such promissory note."

the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase additional shares in this 
offering is exercised, there will be no change in the total proceeds to us, 
as any additional shares would be sold by the selling stockholders. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization 
and financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and 
create a public market for our Class A common stock. As of the date of this 
prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for 
the net proceeds to us of this offering. However, we currently intend to
use the net proceeds to us from this offering primarily for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital, game development, marketing activities 
and capital expenditures. We also intend to use approximately $90.7 million 
of the net proceeds to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to the 
vesting of ZSUs held by current or former employees and other service 
providers, which will occur in connection with this offering. We may also 
use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, 
complementary businesses, technologies or other assets that complement our 
business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into 
any material acquisitions or investments. We intend to contribute a portion 
of the net proceeds to charitable causes through Zynga.org, our philanthropic 
initiative. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds 
in this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing 
securities such as money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial 
paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

numerous factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated 
growth of our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant 
flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. 
  
In addition to raising capital, the primary purpose of this offering is to 
further diversify our access to capital and to support future global growth of

     million.  

(2)  In addition to the cash consideration, we will issue 22,090,909 shares of 
     common stock to SEP I for the contribution by SEP I to us of all the 
     limited liability company interests in SEP Holdings III. If the 
     underwriters exercise their option to purchase in full up to an additional
     1,500,000 shares of common stock, the total cash consideration to SEP I 
     would be approximately $65.4 million, the number of shares of common stock
     issued to SEP I (as presented in this prospectus) will decrease by one-
     half of the aggregate number of shares of common stock purchased by the 
     underwriters pursuant to such exercise, and the number of shares issued 
     to the public (as presented in this prospectus) will increase by the 
     aggregate number of shares of common stock purchased by the underwriters 
     pursuant to such exercise. One-half of the net proceeds from any exercise 
     of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of common stock 
     will be paid to SEP I. This payment of net proceeds and/or issuance of 
     shares of common stock to SEP I is intended to represent a portion of the 
     consideration paid to SEP I for its contribution of all the limited 
     liability company interests in SEP Holdings III to us.  

(3)  The final amount of the cash consideration paid to Ross Exploration is 
     subject to adjustment as described in “The Marquis Acquisition.” We will 
     use any difference between the indicated amount and the actual cash 
     consideration paid for the contribution to us of the limited liability 
     company interests in Marquis LLC for general corporate purposes. In 
     addition to the cash consideration, we will issue 909,091 shares of our 
     common stock to Ross Exploration for the contribution by it to us of all 
     the limited liability company interests in Marquis LLC.  

(4)  If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase shares of common 
     stock in full, the underwriting discounts and commissions will be 
     approximately $16.4 million.  

(5)  In connection with the closing of this offering, we will reimburse SEP I 
     for the fees and expenses that it paid on our behalf in connection with 
     this offering and the formation transactions.  

(6)  We plan to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering of 
     approximately $64 million, along with cash generated from the results of 
     operations, to fund our $413 million capital expenditure budget for the 
     period from January 2012 through December 2013. This budget plans for the 
     drilling of 75 gross (46 net) wells. Pending use of the remaining net 
     proceeds of this offering, and any net proceeds paid to us from the 
     exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of 
     common stock from us, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest 
     bearing, investment-grade securities."

flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public 
market for our common stock. Additionally, we intend to use approximately 
$20 million of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to pay down 
the balances outstanding under our term loan and senior term loan. We 
incurred this indebtedness in May 2011 in connection with our acquisition 
of OffiSync. As of September 30, 2011, we had total indebtedness of $29.0

date of March 1, 2016 and has a fixed interest rate of 10.0% per annum, and 
the senior term loan component has a maturity date of May 1, 2015 and bears 
interest at a rate of prime plus 0.375%, or 3.625%, as of 
September 30, 2011. 

As of the date of this prospectus, except as described above, we cannot 
specify with certainty all of the other particular uses for the net proceeds 
from this offering. However, we expect to use the remaining net proceeds to 
us from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including 
headcount expansion, investments in our data center, sales and marketing 
activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures. 
We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or 
investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our 
business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter 
into any acquisitions or investments. 

Management’s plans for the remaining proceeds of this offering are subject 
to change due to unforeseen events and opportunities, and the amounts and 
timing of our actual expenditures depend on several factors. Accordingly, 
our management team will have broad discretion in using the remaining net 
proceeds from this offering. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering, 
we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates 
of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the United

structuring fees and offering expenses:

                                   Amount of 
                                   Proceeds        Percentage of

Distribution to SemGroup          $  127.3            100% 

The cash distribution to SemGroup made with the net proceeds of this offering
will be made in consideration of its contribution to us of all of the 
partnership interests in SemCrude, L.P., which owns all of our initial assets,
and to reimburse SemGroup for certain capital expenditures incurred with 
respect to those assets. 

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the 
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public. If the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units in 
full, the additional net proceeds will be approximately $19.5 million. The 
net proceeds from any exercise of such option will be used to make an 
additional cash distribution to SemGroup in consideration of its contribution 
to us of all of the limited and general partner interests in SemCrude, L.P. 
at closing and to reimburse SemGroup for certain capital expenditures 
incurred with respect to our assets. If the underwriters do not exercise 
their option to purchase additional common units in full, we will issue the 
common units not purchased to SemGroup upon the expiration of the option 
(1,050,000 common units if the option is not exercised at all) in 
consideration of its contribution to us of all of the limited and general 
partner interests in SemCrude, L.P. at closing. We will not receive any 
additional consideration from SemGroup in connection with such issuance. The 
exercise of the underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of 
common units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum 
quarterly distribution on all units. 

SemGroup has informed us that all of the net proceeds distributed to it will 
be used to repay, on a pro rata basis, a portion of the aggregate $181 
million of indebtedness outstanding under its term loan A and term loan B. 
The interest rates in effect at September 30, 2011 on the term loan A and 
the term loan B were 3.74% and 5.75%, respectively. Term loan A matures on 
June 20, 2016, and term loan B matures on June 20, 2018. SemGroup entered 
into the term loans in June 2011 and used the proceeds from the term loans, 
together with proceeds from a new revolving credit facility, to retire its
previous revolving credit facility and term loan. 

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under SemGroup’s term 
loan A and will, in that respect, receive a portion of the net proceeds of 
this offering."

(1)  If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common 
     units in full, the gross proceeds would be $197 million and the amount 
     borrowed under our new revolving credit facility would be approximately 
     $104 million.  

We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ option to 
purchase additional common units to reduce outstanding borrowings under our new
revolving credit facility. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase additional common units, the ownership interest of the public 
unitholders will increase to 10,350,000 common units representing an aggregate 
45.4% limited partner interest in us and the ownership interest of our general 
partner will increase to 22,795 general partner units representing a 0.1% 
general partner interest in us."
