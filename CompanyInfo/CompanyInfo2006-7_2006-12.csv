remaining approximately $150.3 million of the net proceeds to pay a dividend,
ratably, based on their percentage ownership of our common stock, to our
stockholders existing immediately prior to the offering, consisting of
affiliates of First Reserve and certain members of our management. Of such

members of our management, consisting of Mr. Thomas ($5,866,697) and Mr. Biehl
($328,493), and approximately $1,979,953 to be received by seven other employees

percentage ownership of our common stock, to our existing stockholders. In the
event the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option, the amount of
this dividend will be approximately $26.3 million. Of such amount, approximately
$24.9 million will be received by FR X Chart Holdings LLC, an affiliate of First
Reserve. In addition, approximately $1.4 million in the aggregate will be

——————

(1)A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received
from Messrs. Engel and Cohl described below. These funds will be repaid out of
the proceeds of this offering and the private placement not being placed in
trust upon consummation of this offering.

(2)Represents 4% of the gross proceeds ($720,000) from the sale of the 3,000,000
units in this offering and the private placement and 3% of the gross proceeds
($74,250) from the sale of the 412,500 units subject to the underwriters’
over-allotment option.

(3)The 1% non-accountable expense allowance payable to Maxim Group LLC is not
payable with respect to the units sold upon exercise of the underwriters’
over-allotment option.

(4)Represents 4% of the gross proceeds ($720,000) from the sale of the 3,000,000
units in this offering and the private placement and 5% of the gross proceeds
($123,750) from the sale of the 412,500 units subject to the
underwriters’ over-allotment option that will be paid to Maxim Group LLC only
upon consummation of a business combination and then only with respect to those
units as to which the component shares have not been redeemed. If a business
combination is not consummated and we dissolve and liquidate our trust account
to our public stockholders as part of our plan of dissolution and liquidation as
approved by our stockholders, such amounts will be distributed among our public
stockholders.

(5)Includes $720,000 (or $843,750 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is
exercised in full) of the underwriters’ discount, which Maxim Group LLC has
agreed to deposit into the trust account and forfeit if we do not consummate a
business combination.

(6)Of this amount held in the trust account, up to $15,780,000 (or $18,057,750 if
the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full) may be used by us
to consummate a business combination.

(7)We expect that the estimated amount of the net interest earned on the trust
account that may be released to us to cover our operating expenses will be
$630,000. Of the $780,000 currently reserved to cover our operating expenses, we
anticipate using $630,000 of such net interest together with $150,000 of
proceeds not held in trust.

(8)These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items
may differ substantially from those set forth herein.

(9)We have estimated this cost to be approximately $200,000. We expect to fund
approximately $170,000 of this cost from the interest earned on the funds in the
trust account which is released to us.

(10)We have estimated the total of such costs over a 24 month period to be $180,000.
We expect to fund approximately $108,000 ($4,500 per month) of this cost from
the interest earned on the funds in the trust account which is released to us.

(11)We have estimated this cost to be approximately $200,000. We expect to fund
approximately $191,000 of this cost from the interest earned on the funds in the
trust account which is released to us.

(12)We have estimated this cost to be approximately $50,000. We expect to fund
approximately $41,000 of this cost from the interest earned on the funds in the
trust account which is released to us.

(13)We have estimated this cost to be approximately $150,000. We expect to fund
approximately $120,000 of this cost from the interest earned on the funds in the
trust account which is released to us. We currently estimate that we would
require approximately $50,000 to $75,000 to implement our stockholder approved
plan of dissolution and liquidation in the event we do not consummate a business
combination.

$16,500,000, or $18,900,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of the net proceeds of the offering will be placed in a trust
account at Lehman Brothers Inc. maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Of this amount, up to $720,000
($843,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will
be paid to Maxim Group LLC as contingent fees in connection with this offering
and the private placement, if and only if a business combination is consummated,
leaving us with $15,780,000 with which to consummate a business combination.
Other than interest income which may be released to us as described in the table
above, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our dissolution
and liquidation to our public stockholders of our trust account as part of our
stockholder-approved plan of dissolution and liquidation, net of any taxes paid.
The proceeds held in the trust fund (exclusive of any funds held for the benefit
of the underwriters or used to pay public stockholders who have exercised their
conversion rights) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination or, if there
is insufficient funds not held in trust, to pay other expenses relating to such
transaction such as reimbursement to insiders for out-of-pocket expenses, third
party due diligence expenses or potential finders fees, in each case only upon
the consummation of a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as determined
by our board of directors at that time.

Pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement, we have agreed to pay a monthly fee
of $7,500 to Silverback Books, an affiliate of Messrs. Engel, Cohl and
Dombrowski (our chief executive officer, president and chief operating officer,
respectively), for general and administrative services, including but not
limited to receptionist, secretarial and general office services, provided, that
$4,500 of such amount shall be payable only from the interest earned on the
trust account. This agreement commences on the date of this prospectus and shall
continue until the earlier of the consummation of a business combination or our
dissolution and liquidation to our public stockholders of our trust account as
part of our stockholder-approved plan of dissolution and liquidation.

Prior to the closing of a business combination, we have agreed to obtain keyman
life insurance in the amount of $2,000,000 in the aggregate on the lives of
Messrs. Engel and Cohl for a three year period. Based on current estimates, the
premium for such life insurance policies, of which we will be the sole
beneficiary, is expected to be approximately $30,000 per year, and will be
funded from the interest earned on the proceeds held in the trust account.

We have estimated that the costs to identify and research prospective target
businesses and the costs related to the business combination, including legal
and accounting expenses to structure the transaction, prepare the transaction
documents and file the related proxy statement, will be approximately $600,000.
Only $78,000 of the net proceeds have been allocated for such purposes and we
intend to fund the balance ($522,000), as well as amounts that may exceed our
current estimates, from the interest earned on the proceeds being held in the
trust account, less interest earned on the trust account held back in the trust
account to ensure a $6.00 per share liquidation price to public stockholders (if
applicable). We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will
be performed by some or all of our officers and directors, and may include
engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and
directors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of
prospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds and a portion of the interest
earned on the funds in the trust account which is released to us allocated to
working capital for director and officer liability insurance premiums. We intend
to fund our working capital needs as well as amounts that may exceed our current
estimates, from the interest earned on the proceeds being held in the trust
account (less up to the first $74,250 in interest earned on the amount held in
trust to cover any shortfalls if the overallotment option is exercised in full),
with the balance being held for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below. The interest earned on the trust account in excess of
the amount necessary to have a $6.00 per share liquidation price to the public
stockholders will be released to us to fund our working capital and costs
associated with our stockholder-approved plan of dissolution and liquidation
including reserves, if any, if we do not consummate a business combination. No
interest will be payable to public stockholders converting in connection with a
business combination.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of such working capital to make
a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit
such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such
payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital
available outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other
expenses related to finding another suitable business combination without
securing additional financing. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the
allotted time and would be forced to dissolve and liquidate as part of our
stockholder-approved plan of dissolution and liquidation.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is
less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event, the
proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target businesses, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.

As of the date of this prospectus, Howard Cohl, our president, and affiliates of
Peter Engel, our chief executive officer, have loaned us a total of $235,000,
which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering, such as SEC
registration fees, NASD registration fees, blue sky fees and certain legal and
accounting fees and expenses. These loans will be payable without interest on
the earlier of June 30, 2007 or the consummation of this offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not being placed in
trust. In addition, prior to our formation, affiliates of Peter Engel paid for
certain legal and other expenses on our behalf aggregating $60,000, which we
have recorded as deferred offering costs. During the period ending December 31,
2005, we have repaid Peter Engel’s affiliates in full for the $60,000 amount.

The net proceeds of this offering and the private placement not held in the
trust fund and not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be
invested only in United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury
Bill issued by the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty
days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

By restricting the investment of the proceeds of this offering to these
instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act. Notwithstanding our belief that we are
not required to comply with the requirements of such act, in the event that the
stockholders do not approve a plan of dissolution and liquidation and the funds
remain in the trust account for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be
considered to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such
act. As disclosed in the table above, the interest income derived from
investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray our
general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
and all costs associated with the consummation of a business combination, until
a business combination is completed. We believe that, upon consummation of this
offering and the private placement and with the interest income generated by the
funds held in trust, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at
least the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not
consummated during that time.

Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month general and administrative service
fees described above ($4,500 of which shall be payable only from the interest
earned on the trust account), no compensation of any kind (including finder’s
and consulting fees) will be paid by us or any person or entity to any of our
existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination.
However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. After the consummation of a
business combination, if any, to the extent our management remains as officers
of the resulting business, we anticipate that they may enter into employment or
consulting agreements, the terms of which shall be negotiated and which we
expect to be comparable to employment or consulting agreements with other
similarly-situated companies in the publishing industry. Further, after the
consummation of a business combination, if any, to the extent our directors
remain as directors of the resulting business, we anticipate that they will
receive compensation comparable to directors at other similarly-situated
companies in the publishing industry.

If, at any time within five years of the consummation of a business combination,
our publicly-traded common stock reaches a volume weighted average trading price
of $6.60 per share for each day during any five day period, Messrs. Engel, Cohl
and Dombrowski, our chief executive officer, president and chief operating
officer, respectively (so long as they are either an officer, director, employee
or consultant to us) will receive warrants allowing them to purchase an
aggregate of 200,000 shares of our common stock for $.10 per share. If, at any
time within five years of the consummation of a business combination, our
publicly-traded common stock reaches a volume weighted average trading price of
$7.20 per share for each day during any five day period, these same persons (so
long as they are either an officer, director, employee or consultant to us) will
receive warrants allowing them to purchase an additional 227,000 shares in the
aggregate of our common stock, also for $.10 per share. All such warrants will
be exercisable for a period of five years from the date on which they are
granted.

In addition to the above, after the consummation of a business combination, we
expect to pay two of our directors, Messrs. Arthur and Jaffe, $100,000 each in
director’s fees for services to be provided in their capacity as directors in
the one year following such business combination, should they agree to remain on
our board of directors and if our stockholders approve such payments.
Additionally, as part of their compensation as directors, we have discussed
issuing both Messrs. Arthur and Jaffe options to purchase shares of our common
stock upon consummation of a business combination and implementation of a stock
option plan, should they agree to remain on our board of directors. We have not
yet entered into any formal agreements with regard to these matters. If we do
enter into formal agreements, at the time such agreements become operative,
Messrs. Arthur and Jaffe may no longer qualify as independent directors and, if
necessary, we would need to locate additional directors to serve as our
independent directors.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund, if any,
less the amount of taxes paid, if any, on interest earned but previously
released to us) only in the event of our dissolution and the liquidation of our
trust account to our public stockholders as part of our plan of dissolution and
liquidation approved by our stockholders upon our failure to complete a business
combination. If that public stockholder were to seek to convert such shares into
cash in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder
voted against and which we actually consummate, such public stockholder would
only be entitled to receive $6.00 per share. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
fund. The term public stockholders means the holders of common stock sold as
part of the units in this offering or in the open market, but excludes Mr. Engel
and two non-affiliated accredited investors with respect to the shares included
in the units they purchase in a private placement immediately prior to this
offering since they have waived their conversion and rights to any liquidation
amounts with respect to these shares upon our dissolution."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital, and for possible
acquisitions of businesses and delivery platforms.

The amounts that we actually expend for working capital will vary significantly
depending on a number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, and
the amount of cash that we generate from operations. As a result, we will retain
broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. We
also may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses or
delivery platforms. We have no current agreements or commitments for material
acquisitions of any businesses or delivery platforms. Pending their use, we
intend to invest our net proceeds in high-quality interest-bearing investments.
The proceeds from this offering of ADSs to be sold by the selling shareholders
will be paid to those shareholders. We will not receive any of the proceeds from

fund the redemption of an equal number of common units from Atlas America and
its affiliates. The redemption price per common unit will be equal to the price
per common unit (net of underwriting discounts) sold to the underwriters upon
exercise of their option to purchase additional common units."
CLEVELAND BIOLABS INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cleveland-biolabs-inc-665432-48703,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cleveland-biolabs-inc-665432-48703,424B4,7/21/2006,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4546018,"We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $8,530,000 from the sale of
1,700,000 shares of common stock by us based on a public offering price of $6.00
per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering
expenses.

We will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this
offering. We currently intend to use the balance of our net proceeds for the
following purposes and in the following approximate percentages, which may be
increased or decreased as we deem necessary:

† to complete the development of Protectan CBLB502 (approximately $2,047,200),

† to continue the development of Curaxin CBLC102 through Phase II clinical trials
in multiple cancers (approximately $1,535,400),

† to continue R&D related to a new generation of drugs (new protectans and new
curaxins) (approximately $3,070,800),and

† for general corporate purposes, including working capital (approximately
$1,876,600).

We intend to use the proceeds of this offering to complete the development of
Protectan CBLB502 by (1) arranging for manufacture of the drug candidate by a
GMP contract manufacturing organization, (2) completing formal preclinical
animal studies, (3) filing an IND application, (4) performing a Phase I human
safety study, and (5) filing a NDA application. We also intend to use the
proceeds of this offering to continue the development of Curaxin CBLC102 through
Phase II clinical trials in multiple cancers by (1) developing a high-throughput
method for the manufacturing of drug capsules, (2) continuing drug trials in
multiple cancers, (3) performing tests and assays depicting pharmacological
characteristics of the drug candidate during trials, and (4) monitoring of the
trials with an outside contract research organization. Lastly, we intend to use
the proceeds of this offering to continue R&D related to a new generation of
drugs (new protectans and new curaxins). This R&D process includes (1)
hit-to-lead optimization of new curaxins discovered in the primary screening of
Curaxin CBLC102, and (2) preclinical development of new protectans, which
demonstrate high degrees of radiation protection in preliminary animal
experiments.

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the funds in
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. We cannot predict
whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return.

We anticipate that the net proceeds received from this offering, together with
our existing cash holdings, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for
at least the next 24 months.

Notwithstanding the estimates above, the amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the status of our R&D
efforts, the timing and success of preclinical testing, the timing and success
of any clinical trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory
submissions, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering, the amount
of cash generated by our operations, the amount of competition we face and how
successful we are with obtaining any required licenses and entering into
collaboration arrangements. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the
acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets
that complement our business. However, we have no present understandings,
commitments or agreements to enter into any potential acquisitions or
investments."

(1) Excludes the payment of $100 from Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. for its purchase

    proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.                                  

(2) $148,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the   
    NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange   
    filing fee and a portion of the non-accountable expense allowance and legal  
    and audit fees, have been paid from loans we received from F. Jacob Cherian, 
    Suhel Kanuga and Kishore Mirchandani described below. These funds will be    
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon   
    consummation of this offering.                                               

(3) This amount excludes underwriting fees of 1.25% of the gross proceeds of the 
    offering, or $725,000, or $833,750 if the overallotment is exercised in full,
    which the underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our    
    initial business combination. Upon the consummation of our initial business  
    combination, we will pay such deferred fee to the underwriters out of the    
    proceeds of this offering held in a trust account maintained by The Bank of  
    New York, acting as trustee.                                                 

(4) This amount excludes $832,500 deferred balance of the representative’s 1.50% 
    non-accountable expense allowance, which the representative has agreed to    
    defer until the consummation of our initial business combination. Upon the   
    consummation of our initial business combination, we will pay such deferred  
    balance to the representative of the underwriters out of the proceeds of this
    offering held in a trust account maintained by The Bank of New York, acting  
    as trustee.                                                                  

(5) Miscellaneous expenses include additional expenses that may be incurred by us
    in connection with the offering over and above those specifically listed     
    above, including distribution and mailing costs.                             

(6) This amount includes funds received from the proceeds of this offering, after
    deducting expenses, of which 1.25% of the gross proceeds of this offering    
    representing a portion of the underwriter’s fees, or $725,000 ($833,750 if   
    the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full), and the $832,500     
    balance of the representative’s 1.50% non-accountable expense allowance have 
    been deferred and are payable from the proceeds held in the trust account    
    upon consummation of a business combination. Also includes $2,250,000        
    received prior to the date of this prospectus from the private sale of       
    warrants. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the 
    earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The  
    proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the   
    sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business    
    combination.                                                                 

(7) The amount represents the initial funding of working capital. The remaining  
    portion of working capital will be funded from the interest earned on monies 
    in escrow.                                                                   

(8) Approximately $1,975,000 of working capital will be funded from the interest 
    earned from the net proceeds held in trust payable on a monthly basis. The   
    net proceeds of this offering held in the trust account will only be invested
    in United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued
    by the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7          
    promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not     
    deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
    We believe that the interest earned from the trust proceeds held in trust    
    will generate sufficient funding to satisfy our working requirements. Because
    the initial working capital of $50,000 is being funded from proceeds of this 
    offering, we do not expect that we will need to rely on advances from our    
    officers prior to the receipt of interest earned from the proceeds held in   
    trust.                                                                       

Our agreement with The Bank of New York, as trustee, permits us to utilize up to
$1,975,000 of the interest earned upon monies in the trust for working capital.
We intend to use the working capital for director and officer liability
insurance premiums and general and administrative services, including office
space, utilities and secretarial support, with the balance being held in reserve
for other expenses, such as relocation of our full-time officers to India, due
diligence, legal, accounting, and other fees for structuring and negotiating
business combinations, and deposits, down payments and/or funding of “no shop”
provisions in connection with business combinations as well as for reimbursement
of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in
connection with activities undertaken on our behalf as described below. This
arrangement is for our benefit and is not intended to provide our existing
stockholders or special advisors with any other compensation prior to the
consummation of our initial business combination. We believe that our working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering and the private sale of
warrants as discussed below, to acquire one or more businesses that have
operations primarily in India. To the extent that our capital stock is used in
whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds
held in the trust account that are not used for such purpose as well as any
other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the operations of the
target business.

Some of our officers and directors may choose to purchase securities in this
offering. However, none of them are obligated to do so and we do not have any
agreements or arrangements with any of them requiring them to purchase
securities in this offering.

Prior to the date of this prospectus, we privately sold 2,250,000 warrants, at a
price of $1.00 per warrant, for an aggregate of $2,250,000 to our existing
stockholders, including to our officers, certain of our directors, other
persons who owned shares of our common stock prior to such sale, and, in some
instances, to their respective affiliates. All of the proceeds we received from
the sale of these private placement warrants will be placed in the trust account
upon the consummation of this offering. The privately placed warrants are
identical to the warrants offered by this prospectus except that they are
subject to lock up agreements restricting their sale until after the completion
of a business combination, and they may be exercised on a cashless basis. In
addition, the purchasers of the private placement warrants have waived their
right to receive distributions upon our liquidation prior to a business
combination with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the privately
placed warrants.

During March and April, 2006, our founders advanced an aggregate of $148,000 to
us, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced
in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, the
non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, and a portion
of the non-accountable expense allowance, legal and audit fees and expenses. The
loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of September 30, 2006 or
the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds
of this offering not being placed in trust.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including the deferred underwriters’ discount and the representative’s
non-accountable expense allowance) only in the event there is no business
combination or if that stockholder were to seek to convert such shares into cash
in connection with a business combination which the stockholder voted against
and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a stockholder
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

In the event of our liquidation, our existing stockholders, including purchasers
in our private placement offering, will be entitled to receive funds from the
trust account solely with respect to any shares of common stock which they
purchased in or following this offering."

——————

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including SEC registration fees, NASD filing
fees, AMEX filing fees and legal and accounting fees, have been paid from the
$300,000 loan from our President and Chief Operating Officer, George Sagredos,
which loan shall be repaid upon the closing of the offering. Four days prior to
the effective date of the offering, Mr. Sagredos will make an additional loan to
the Company in the principal amount of $475,000, as more fully described in
footnote (6) below.

(2) Includes $500,000 of the underwriter’s discount that the underwriters have
agreed to defer until the consummation of a business combination and forfeit in
the event we do not consummate a business combination.

(3) Consists of $412,699 in deferred placement fees in connection with Regulation S
private placement payable to Maxim Group LLC from working capital, with such
amount to be paid in four quarterly installments out of interest earned on the
trust account. Maxim Group LLC has agreed to defer such payments until the
expiration of the first full quarter after the date that we have drawn interest
from the trust account aggregating $1,000,000 to fund our working capital and
other expenses. 

(4) Represents 1% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 20,250,000 units in
this offering ($2,025,000) and 3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the
3,037,500 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option ($911,250)
that will be deposited into the trust account and paid to the underwriters only
upon consummation of a business combination and then only with respect to those
units as to which the component shares have not been redeemed. If a business
combination is not consummated and we liquidate, such amounts will be
distributed among our public stockholders. In addition, in the event of a
business combination the amount of contingent underwriting compensation payable
to the underwriters will have priority over other claims to the trust account.

(5) Represents 1% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 825,398 units in the
Regulation S private placement ($82,540) that will be deposited into the trust
account and paid to Maxim Group LLC only upon consummation of a business 
combination. In the event of a business combination, such amounts will have 
priority over the other claims to the trust account.

(6) Excludes (i) $2,025,000 (or $2,936,250 if the underwriters’ over allotment
option is exercised in full) of the underwriters’ discount, and $82,540 of Maxim
Group LLC’s placement agent fee which the underwriters and Maxim Group LLC have
agreed to deposit into the trust account and forfeit in the event we do not
consummate a business combination.

(7) Reflects a term loan in the principal amount of $475,000 to be made by
Mr. Sagredos prior to the closing date of this offering. Such loan is to be
repaid from accrued interest on the trust account.

(8) Reflects a convertible loan of $2,550,000 to be made prior to consummation of
this offering ($3,157,500 if the over-allotment is exercised in full), which
amount is payable upon the earlier to occur of consummation of a business
combination or our liquidation, subject to the right of the holder to convert.

(9) We expect to fund substantially all of our operating costs from interest earned
from the trust account released to us. An aggregate of $3,363,000 (or $3,665,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full) of the interest earned
on the proceeds being held in the trust account will be released to us to fund
our working capital requirements. In addition, we anticipate allocating an
additional $3,178,000 of interest earned on the trust account for (i) payment of
quarterly interest payments on the convertible loan (estimated to be $153,000 in
the aggregate), (ii) repayment of the convertible loan in the principal amount
of $2,550,000 ($3,157,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) in the event it is not converted, and (iii) repayment of the
$475,000 term loan (plus accrued interest).

(10) We are obligated to repay the principal and accrued interest on such loan
following the expiration of the second full quarter after the date that we have
drawn down at least $1 million from accrued interest on the trust account to
fund our working capital requirements. Does not include interest to accrue
during the term of the loan, estimated to be approximately $7,500 per year,
applying an estimated interest rate of 3% per annum.

(11) Assuming an interest rate of 3% per annum, payable in the amount of $19,125 on a
quarterly basis. We are obligated to make quarterly interest payments on such
loan following the expiration of the first full quarter after the date that we
have drawn down at least $1 million from accrued interest on the trust account
to fund our working capital requirements. Such loan bears interest at a per
annum rate equivalent to the per annum interest rate applied to the funds held
in trust during the quarterly period covered by such interest payment. The
principal of such loan is due on the earlier of our dissolution and liquidation
or the consummation of a business combination.

On the closing date of this offering, $202,500,000, or $232,875,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in a
trust account at Lehman Brothers’ Inc. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer
& Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes the net
proceeds of this offering and the Regulation S private placement, a convertible
loan in the principal amount of $2,550,000 to be made prior to the effective
date of this offering by an off-shore company controlled by our President and
Chief Operating Officer, a term loan in the principal amount of $475,000 to be
made prior to the effective date of this offering by our President and Chief
Operating Officer, $2,107,540 ($3,018,790 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of contingent underwriting compensation and
placement fees to be paid to the underwriters and Maxim Group LLC, respectively,
if and only if, a business combination is consummated, and $412,699 in deferred
placement fees to be paid to Maxim Group LLC in connection with the Regulation S
private placement.

Under the terms of our investment management trust agreement we are permitted,
at our discretion, from time to time as interest is earned and funds become
available, to draw the following amounts from the interest accrued on the trust
account: (i) taxes payable on interest earned, (ii) up to $3,363,000 ($3,665,000
if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of interest income released
to us to fund our working capital, (iii) payment of quarterly interest payments
on the convertible loan and repayment of the convertible loan upon the earlier
to occur of our dissolution and liquidation or a business combination, if not
converted, and (iv) repayment of the term loan, plus accrued interest. The
remaining proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidation
of the trust account as part of any plan of dissolution and liquidation approved
by our stockholders. The proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any
funds held for the benefit of the underwriters and Maxim Group LLC or used to
pay stockholders who have exercised their redemption right) may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business (other than amounts paid for finders’ or
professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or costs incurred in connection
with any debt or equity financing made in connection with the business combination) may
be used to finance operations of the target business.

We expect to allocate the $3,363,000 funds identified for working capital as
follows:

——————

(1) The allocation below is an estimate and may not prove to be accurate.

(2) We currently estimate that we would require approximately $50,000 to $75,000 to
implement our stockholder approved plan of dissolution in the event we do not
consummate a business combination.

(3) We will be permitted to draw up to $3,665,000 from the interest earned on our
trust account in the event that the over-allotment is exercised in full.

Only minimal proceeds have been allocated for working capital purposes and we
intend to fund the majority of such amounts from a portion of the interest
earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account. We have agreed with the
representative that $3,363,000 (or $3,665,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the interest earned on the
proceeds being held in the trust account for our benefit (net of taxes payable)
will be released to us upon our request, and in such intervals and in such
amounts as we desire and are available. Although we do not know the rate of
interest to be earned on the trust account and are unable to predict an exact
amount of time it will take to complete a business combination, we believe that
following the completion of this offering it will take a significant amount of
time to find a prospective target and take all of the steps necessary to
complete a business combination. We anticipate that the interest that will
accrue on the trust account, even at an interest rate of 3% per annum, during
the time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be
sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. We expect that due
diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of
our officers and directors, but is expected to include engaging market research
firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will not
receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to make a
deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds
(whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or
otherwise), if such payment was large enough and we had already used up the
funds available for due diligence and related expenses in connection with the
aborted transaction, we could be left with insufficient funds to continue
searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect
to, other potential target businesses. Thus, if we were unable to secure
additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business
combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate. Although
there are no existing written or oral agreements in place, or obligations on the
part of our existing stockholders, it is possible that our existing stockholders
could advance us the additional required funds, thereby increasing the amount of
excess out-of-pocket expenses to be reimbursed following a business combination.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

In addition to the above, we intend to use the interest earned on the trust
account and released to us for the payment of quarterly interest payments on the
convertible loan in the principal amount of $2,550,000 to be made prior to the
effective date of this offering ($3,157,500 in the event the over-allotment
option is exercised in full) and repayment of the convertible loan, for payment
of taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account and repayment of the
$475,000 term loan. We believe that the amount allocated to working capital,
together with interest earned on the trust account available to us, as described
above, will be sufficient to cover the costs related to the acquisition of a
target business and reimbursement costs, even if the costs of due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business
combination exceed our estimates.

As of the date of this prospectus, George Sagredos, our President, Chief
Operating Officer and a director has advanced to us a total of $300,000, which
was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee, AMEX Listing
fees, legal fees and expenses and an advance on Maxim’s non accountable expense
allowance. Such loan will be payable with 4% annual interest on the closing of
this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not
being placed in trust.

Four days prior to the effective date, Mr. Sagredos will loan us an additional
$475,000. Such loan will be placed in the trust account on the closing date of
this offering. Such loan bears interest at a per annum rate equivalent to the
per annum interest rate applied to the funds held in the trust account during
the same period that such loan is outstanding. Principal and accrued interest is
to be repaid from interest accrued on the trust account. The Company is not
obligated to repay such loan until the earlier of (i) expiration of the second
full quarter after the date that it has drawn down at least $1,000,000 from
accrued interest from the trust account to fund its working capital
requirements, (ii) the consummation of a business combination and (iii) our
dissolution and liquidation.

In addition, four days prior to the effective date of this offering, Robert
Ventures Limited, a company formed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands
which is controlled by George Sagredos, will loan us an additional $2,550,000 in
the form of a convertible loan ($3,157,500 if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full). Such loan bears interest at a per annum rate equivalent to
the per annum interest rate applied to the funds held in the trust account
during the quarterly period covered by such interest payment. We are obligated
to make quarterly interest payments on such loan following the expiration of the
first full quarter after the date that we have drawn down at least $1 million in
accrued interest on the trust account to fund our working capital requirements.
Such loan is due the earlier of our liquidation or the consummation of a
business combination. Quarterly interest payments and the repayment of principal
will be made from interest accrued on the trust account.

The $475,000 term loan and the $2,550,000 convertible loan ($3,157,500 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full) are being made so that a total of
$202,500,000 ($232,875,000 if the underwriters’ over allotment option is
exercised in full) will be in the trust account on the closing date of this
offering.

The repayment of each of the $475,000 term loan and the $2,550,000 convertible
loan ($3,157,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) is
subordinate to the public stockholders receiving a minimum of $10.00 per share,
subject to any valid claims by our creditors which are not covered by amounts in
the trust account or indemnities provided by our officers and directors, in the
event of our liquidation and dissolution if we do not consummate a business
combination, or if they exercise their redemption rights.

The Company has decided to treat the $300,000 loan which was made by Mr.
Sagredos in October 2005, and each of the $2,550,000 convertible loan
($3,157,500 if the over-allotment is exercised in full) and $475,000 term loan,
both to be made four days prior to the effective date of the offering, as
separate transactions because each of such loans, as described above, contains
different business terms with respect to the timing of repayment, applicable
interest rate and convertibility, due to the differing facts and circumstances
of the Company at the time such funds were required, which reflects the actual
sequencing of such transactions.

The funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of this
offering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed to be an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the
requirements of such act, in the event that the stockholders do not approve a
plan of dissolution and liquidation and the funds remain in the trust account
for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment
company and thus required to comply with such act.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, and receipt of interest on
the trust account (net of taxes payable), we will have sufficient available
funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

Other than options that we have agreed to grant to each of Messrs. Sagredos and
Theotokis, which vest following the consummation of a business combination, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, from us or from
any other party for any services rendered to us prior to or in connection with
the consummation of the business combination. Our existing stockholders will
only be entitled to receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf. To the extent that
such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless
we consummate a business combination, in which event this reimbursement
obligation would in all likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target
business. Since the role of present management after a business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, (net
of (i) taxes payable on interest earned, (ii) up to $3,363,000 ($3,665,000 if
the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of interest income released to
us to fund our working capital, (iii) payment of quarterly interest payments on
the convertible loan and repayment of the convertible loan upon the earlier to
occur of our dissolution and liquidation or a business combination, if not
converted, and (iv) repayment of the term loan, plus accrued interest), only in
the event of the liquidation of the trust account as part of our plan of
dissolution and liquidation approved by our stockholders upon our failure to
complete a business combination within the allotted time or if that public
stockholder were to seek to redeem such shares for cash in connection with a
business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we
actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

——————

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including SEC registration fees, NASD filing
fees, AMEX filing fees and legal and accounting fees, have been paid from the
$300,000 loan from our President and Chief Operating Officer, George Sagredos,
which loan shall be repaid upon the closing of the offering. Four days prior to
the effective date of the offering, Mr. Sagredos will make an additional loan to
the Company in the principal amount of $475,000, as more fully described in
footnote (6) below.

(2) Includes $500,000 of the underwriter’s discount that the underwriters have
agreed to defer until the consummation of a business combination and forfeit in
the event we do not consummate a business combination.

(3) Consists of $412,699 in deferred placement fees in connection with Regulation S
private placement payable to Maxim Group LLC from working capital, with such
amount to be paid in four quarterly installments out of interest earned on the
trust account. Maxim Group LLC has agreed to defer such payments until the
expiration of the first full quarter after the date that we have drawn interest
from the trust account aggregating $1,000,000 to fund our working capital and
other expenses. 

(4) Represents 1% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 20,250,000 units in
this offering ($2,025,000) and 3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the
3,037,500 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option ($911,250)
that will be deposited into the trust account and paid to the underwriters only
upon consummation of a business combination and then only with respect to those
units as to which the component shares have not been redeemed. If a business
combination is not consummated and we liquidate, such amounts will be
distributed among our public stockholders. In addition, in the event of a
business combination the amount of contingent underwriting compensation payable
to the underwriters will have priority over other claims to the trust account.

(5) Represents 1% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 825,398 units in the
Regulation S private placement ($82,540) that will be deposited into the trust
account and paid to Maxim Group LLC only upon consummation of a business 
combination. In the event of a business combination, such amounts will have 
priority over the other claims to the trust account.

(6) Excludes (i) $2,025,000 (or $2,936,250 if the underwriters’ over allotment
option is exercised in full) of the underwriters’ discount, and $82,540 of Maxim
Group LLC’s placement agent fee which the underwriters and Maxim Group LLC have
agreed to deposit into the trust account and forfeit in the event we do not
consummate a business combination.

(7) Reflects a term loan in the principal amount of $475,000 to be made by
Mr. Sagredos prior to the closing date of this offering. Such loan is to be
repaid from accrued interest on the trust account.

(8) Reflects a convertible loan of $2,550,000 to be made prior to consummation of
this offering ($3,157,500 if the over-allotment is exercised in full), which
amount is payable upon the earlier to occur of consummation of a business
combination or our liquidation, subject to the right of the holder to convert.

(9) We expect to fund substantially all of our operating costs from interest earned
from the trust account released to us. An aggregate of $3,363,000 (or $3,665,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full) of the interest earned
on the proceeds being held in the trust account will be released to us to fund
our working capital requirements. In addition, we anticipate allocating an
additional $3,178,000 of interest earned on the trust account for (i) payment of
quarterly interest payments on the convertible loan (estimated to be $153,000 in
the aggregate), (ii) repayment of the convertible loan in the principal amount
of $2,550,000 ($3,157,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) in the event it is not converted, and (iii) repayment of the
$475,000 term loan (plus accrued interest).

(10) We are obligated to repay the principal and accrued interest on such loan
following the expiration of the second full quarter after the date that we have
drawn down at least $1 million from accrued interest on the trust account to
fund our working capital requirements. Does not include interest to accrue
during the term of the loan, estimated to be approximately $7,500 per year,
applying an estimated interest rate of 3% per annum.

(11) Assuming an interest rate of 3% per annum, payable in the amount of $19,125 on a
quarterly basis. We are obligated to make quarterly interest payments on such
loan following the expiration of the first full quarter after the date that we
have drawn down at least $1 million from accrued interest on the trust account
to fund our working capital requirements. Such loan bears interest at a per
annum rate equivalent to the per annum interest rate applied to the funds held
in trust during the quarterly period covered by such interest payment. The
principal of such loan is due on the earlier of our dissolution and liquidation
or the consummation of a business combination.

On the closing date of this offering, $202,500,000, or $232,875,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in a
trust account at Lehman Brothers’ Inc. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer
& Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes the net
proceeds of this offering and the Regulation S private placement, a convertible
loan in the principal amount of $2,550,000 to be made prior to the effective
date of this offering by an off-shore company controlled by our President and
Chief Operating Officer, a term loan in the principal amount of $475,000 to be
made prior to the effective date of this offering by our President and Chief
Operating Officer, $2,107,540 ($3,018,790 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of contingent underwriting compensation and
placement fees to be paid to the underwriters and Maxim Group LLC, respectively,
if and only if, a business combination is consummated, and $412,699 in deferred
placement fees to be paid to Maxim Group LLC in connection with the Regulation S
private placement.

Under the terms of our investment management trust agreement we are permitted,
at our discretion, from time to time as interest is earned and funds become
available, to draw the following amounts from the interest accrued on the trust
account: (i) taxes payable on interest earned, (ii) up to $3,363,000 ($3,665,000
if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of interest income released
to us to fund our working capital, (iii) payment of quarterly interest payments
on the convertible loan and repayment of the convertible loan upon the earlier
to occur of our dissolution and liquidation or a business combination, if not
converted, and (iv) repayment of the term loan, plus accrued interest. The
remaining proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidation
of the trust account as part of any plan of dissolution and liquidation approved
by our stockholders. The proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any
funds held for the benefit of the underwriters and Maxim Group LLC or used to
pay stockholders who have exercised their redemption right) may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business (other than amounts paid for finders’ or
professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or costs incurred in connection
with any debt or equity financing made in connection with the business combination) may
be used to finance operations of the target business.

We expect to allocate the $3,363,000 funds identified for working capital as

 Total(3)                                                            $ 3,363,000  


——————

(1) The allocation below is an estimate and may not prove to be accurate.

(2) We currently estimate that we would require approximately $50,000 to $75,000 to
implement our stockholder approved plan of dissolution in the event we do not
consummate a business combination.

(3) We will be permitted to draw up to $3,665,000 from the interest earned on our
trust account in the event that the over-allotment is exercised in full.

Only minimal proceeds have been allocated for working capital purposes and we
intend to fund the majority of such amounts from a portion of the interest
earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account. We have agreed with the
representative that $3,363,000 (or $3,665,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the interest earned on the
proceeds being held in the trust account for our benefit (net of taxes payable)
will be released to us upon our request, and in such intervals and in such
amounts as we desire and are available. Although we do not know the rate of
interest to be earned on the trust account and are unable to predict an exact
amount of time it will take to complete a business combination, we believe that
following the completion of this offering it will take a significant amount of
time to find a prospective target and take all of the steps necessary to
complete a business combination. We anticipate that the interest that will
accrue on the trust account, even at an interest rate of 3% per annum, during
the time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be
sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. We expect that due
diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of
our officers and directors, but is expected to include engaging market research
firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will not
receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to make a
deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds
(whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or
otherwise), if such payment was large enough and we had already used up the
funds available for due diligence and related expenses in connection with the
aborted transaction, we could be left with insufficient funds to continue
searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect
to, other potential target businesses. Thus, if we were unable to secure
additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business
combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate. Although
there are no existing written or oral agreements in place, or obligations on the
part of our existing stockholders, it is possible that our existing stockholders
could advance us the additional required funds, thereby increasing the amount of
excess out-of-pocket expenses to be reimbursed following a business combination.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

In addition to the above, we intend to use the interest earned on the trust
account and released to us for the payment of quarterly interest payments on the
convertible loan in the principal amount of $2,550,000 to be made prior to the
effective date of this offering ($3,157,500 in the event the over-allotment
option is exercised in full) and repayment of the convertible loan, for payment
of taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account and repayment of the
$475,000 term loan. We believe that the amount allocated to working capital,
together with interest earned on the trust account available to us, as described
above, will be sufficient to cover the costs related to the acquisition of a
target business and reimbursement costs, even if the costs of due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business
combination exceed our estimates.

As of the date of this prospectus, George Sagredos, our President, Chief
Operating Officer and a director has advanced to us a total of $300,000, which
was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee, AMEX Listing
fees, legal fees and expenses and an advance on Maxim’s non accountable expense
allowance. Such loan will be payable with 4% annual interest on the closing of
this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not
being placed in trust.

Four days prior to the effective date, Mr. Sagredos will loan us an additional
$475,000. Such loan will be placed in the trust account on the closing date of
this offering. Such loan bears interest at a per annum rate equivalent to the
per annum interest rate applied to the funds held in the trust account during
the same period that such loan is outstanding. Principal and accrued interest is
to be repaid from interest accrued on the trust account. The Company is not
obligated to repay such loan until the earlier of (i) expiration of the second
full quarter after the date that it has drawn down at least $1,000,000 from
accrued interest from the trust account to fund its working capital
requirements, (ii) the consummation of a business combination and (iii) our
dissolution and liquidation.

In addition, four days prior to the effective date of this offering, Robert
Ventures Limited, a company formed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands
which is controlled by George Sagredos, will loan us an additional $2,550,000 in
the form of a convertible loan ($3,157,500 if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full). Such loan bears interest at a per annum rate equivalent to
the per annum interest rate applied to the funds held in the trust account
during the quarterly period covered by such interest payment. We are obligated
to make quarterly interest payments on such loan following the expiration of the
first full quarter after the date that we have drawn down at least $1 million in
accrued interest on the trust account to fund our working capital requirements.
Such loan is due the earlier of our liquidation or the consummation of a
business combination. Quarterly interest payments and the repayment of principal
will be made from interest accrued on the trust account.

The $475,000 term loan and the $2,550,000 convertible loan ($3,157,500 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full) are being made so that a total of
$202,500,000 ($232,875,000 if the underwriters’ over allotment option is
exercised in full) will be in the trust account on the closing date of this
offering.

The repayment of each of the $475,000 term loan and the $2,550,000 convertible
loan ($3,157,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) is
subordinate to the public stockholders receiving a minimum of $10.00 per share,
subject to any valid claims by our creditors which are not covered by amounts in
the trust account or indemnities provided by our officers and directors, in the
event of our liquidation and dissolution if we do not consummate a business
combination, or if they exercise their redemption rights.

The Company has decided to treat the $300,000 loan which was made by Mr.
Sagredos in October 2005, and each of the $2,550,000 convertible loan
($3,157,500 if the over-allotment is exercised in full) and $475,000 term loan,
both to be made four days prior to the effective date of the offering, as
separate transactions because each of such loans, as described above, contains
different business terms with respect to the timing of repayment, applicable
interest rate and convertibility, due to the differing facts and circumstances
of the Company at the time such funds were required, which reflects the actual
sequencing of such transactions.

The funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of this
offering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed to be an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the
requirements of such act, in the event that the stockholders do not approve a
plan of dissolution and liquidation and the funds remain in the trust account
for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment
company and thus required to comply with such act.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, and receipt of interest on
the trust account (net of taxes payable), we will have sufficient available
funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

Other than options that we have agreed to grant to each of Messrs. Sagredos and
Theotokis, which vest following the consummation of a business combination, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, from us or from
any other party for any services rendered to us prior to or in connection with
the consummation of the business combination. Our existing stockholders will
only be entitled to receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf. To the extent that
such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless
we consummate a business combination, in which event this reimbursement
obligation would in all likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target
business. Since the role of present management after a business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, (net
of (i) taxes payable on interest earned, (ii) up to $3,363,000 ($3,665,000 if
the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of interest income released to
us to fund our working capital, (iii) payment of quarterly interest payments on
the convertible loan and repayment of the convertible loan upon the earlier to
occur of our dissolution and liquidation or a business combination, if not
converted, and (iv) repayment of the term loan, plus accrued interest), only in
the event of the liquidation of the trust account as part of our plan of
dissolution and liquidation approved by our stockholders upon our failure to
complete a business combination within the allotted time or if that public
stockholder were to seek to redeem such shares for cash in connection with a
business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we
actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

——————

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including SEC registration fees, NASD filing
fees, AMEX filing fees and legal and accounting fees, have been paid from the
$300,000 loan from our President and Chief Operating Officer, George Sagredos,
which loan shall be repaid upon the closing of the offering. Four days prior to
the effective date of the offering, Mr. Sagredos will make an additional loan to
the Company in the principal amount of $475,000, as more fully described in
footnote (6) below.

(2) Includes $500,000 of the underwriter’s discount that the underwriters have
agreed to defer until the consummation of a business combination and forfeit in
the event we do not consummate a business combination.

(3) Consists of $412,699 in deferred placement fees in connection with Regulation S
private placement payable to Maxim Group LLC from working capital, with such
amount to be paid in four quarterly installments out of interest earned on the
trust account. Maxim Group LLC has agreed to defer such payments until the
expiration of the first full quarter after the date that we have drawn interest
from the trust account aggregating $1,000,000 to fund our working capital and
other expenses. 

(4) Represents 1% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 20,250,000 units in
this offering ($2,025,000) and 3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the
3,037,500 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option ($911,250)
that will be deposited into the trust account and paid to the underwriters only
upon consummation of a business combination and then only with respect to those
units as to which the component shares have not been redeemed. If a business
combination is not consummated and we liquidate, such amounts will be
distributed among our public stockholders. In addition, in the event of a
business combination the amount of contingent underwriting compensation payable
to the underwriters will have priority over other claims to the trust account.

(5) Represents 1% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 825,398 units in the
Regulation S private placement ($82,540) that will be deposited into the trust
account and paid to Maxim Group LLC only upon consummation of a business 
combination. In the event of a business combination, such amounts will have 
priority over the other claims to the trust account.

(6) Excludes (i) $2,025,000 (or $2,936,250 if the underwriters’ over allotment
option is exercised in full) of the underwriters’ discount, and $82,540 of Maxim
Group LLC’s placement agent fee which the underwriters and Maxim Group LLC have
agreed to deposit into the trust account and forfeit in the event we do not
consummate a business combination.

(7) Reflects a term loan in the principal amount of $475,000 to be made by
Mr. Sagredos prior to the closing date of this offering. Such loan is to be
repaid from accrued interest on the trust account.

(8) Reflects a convertible loan of $2,550,000 to be made prior to consummation of
this offering ($3,157,500 if the over-allotment is exercised in full), which
amount is payable upon the earlier to occur of consummation of a business
combination or our liquidation, subject to the right of the holder to convert.

(9) We expect to fund substantially all of our operating costs from interest earned
from the trust account released to us. An aggregate of $3,363,000 (or $3,665,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full) of the interest earned
on the proceeds being held in the trust account will be released to us to fund
our working capital requirements. In addition, we anticipate allocating an
additional $3,178,000 of interest earned on the trust account for (i) payment of
quarterly interest payments on the convertible loan (estimated to be $153,000 in
the aggregate), (ii) repayment of the convertible loan in the principal amount
of $2,550,000 ($3,157,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) in the event it is not converted, and (iii) repayment of the
$475,000 term loan (plus accrued interest).

(10) We are obligated to repay the principal and accrued interest on such loan
following the expiration of the second full quarter after the date that we have
drawn down at least $1 million from accrued interest on the trust account to
fund our working capital requirements. Does not include interest to accrue
during the term of the loan, estimated to be approximately $7,500 per year,
applying an estimated interest rate of 3% per annum.

(11) Assuming an interest rate of 3% per annum, payable in the amount of $19,125 on a
quarterly basis. We are obligated to make quarterly interest payments on such
loan following the expiration of the first full quarter after the date that we
have drawn down at least $1 million from accrued interest on the trust account
to fund our working capital requirements. Such loan bears interest at a per
annum rate equivalent to the per annum interest rate applied to the funds held
in trust during the quarterly period covered by such interest payment. The
principal of such loan is due on the earlier of our dissolution and liquidation
or the consummation of a business combination.

On the closing date of this offering, $202,500,000, or $232,875,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in a
trust account at Lehman Brothers’ Inc. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer
& Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes the net
proceeds of this offering and the Regulation S private placement, a convertible
loan in the principal amount of $2,550,000 to be made prior to the effective
date of this offering by an off-shore company controlled by our President and
Chief Operating Officer, a term loan in the principal amount of $475,000 to be
made prior to the effective date of this offering by our President and Chief
Operating Officer, $2,107,540 ($3,018,790 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of contingent underwriting compensation and
placement fees to be paid to the underwriters and Maxim Group LLC, respectively,
if and only if, a business combination is consummated, and $412,699 in deferred
placement fees to be paid to Maxim Group LLC in connection with the Regulation S
private placement.

Under the terms of our investment management trust agreement we are permitted,
at our discretion, from time to time as interest is earned and funds become
available, to draw the following amounts from the interest accrued on the trust
account: (i) taxes payable on interest earned, (ii) up to $3,363,000 ($3,665,000
if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of interest income released
to us to fund our working capital, (iii) payment of quarterly interest payments
on the convertible loan and repayment of the convertible loan upon the earlier
to occur of our dissolution and liquidation or a business combination, if not
converted, and (iv) repayment of the term loan, plus accrued interest. The
remaining proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidation
of the trust account as part of any plan of dissolution and liquidation approved
by our stockholders. The proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any
funds held for the benefit of the underwriters and Maxim Group LLC or used to
pay stockholders who have exercised their redemption right) may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business (other than amounts paid for finders’ or
professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or costs incurred in connection
with any debt or equity financing made in connection with the business combination) may
be used to finance operations of the target business.

We expect to allocate the $3,363,000 funds identified for working capital as
follows:

 Total(3)                                                            $ 3,363,000  


——————

(1) The allocation below is an estimate and may not prove to be accurate.

(2) We currently estimate that we would require approximately $50,000 to $75,000 to
implement our stockholder approved plan of dissolution in the event we do not
consummate a business combination.

(3) We will be permitted to draw up to $3,665,000 from the interest earned on our
trust account in the event that the over-allotment is exercised in full.

Only minimal proceeds have been allocated for working capital purposes and we
intend to fund the majority of such amounts from a portion of the interest
earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account. We have agreed with the
representative that $3,363,000 (or $3,665,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the interest earned on the
proceeds being held in the trust account for our benefit (net of taxes payable)
will be released to us upon our request, and in such intervals and in such
amounts as we desire and are available. Although we do not know the rate of
interest to be earned on the trust account and are unable to predict an exact
amount of time it will take to complete a business combination, we believe that
following the completion of this offering it will take a significant amount of
time to find a prospective target and take all of the steps necessary to
complete a business combination. We anticipate that the interest that will
accrue on the trust account, even at an interest rate of 3% per annum, during
the time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be
sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. We expect that due
diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of
our officers and directors, but is expected to include engaging market research
firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will not
receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to make a
deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds
(whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or
otherwise), if such payment was large enough and we had already used up the
funds available for due diligence and related expenses in connection with the
aborted transaction, we could be left with insufficient funds to continue
searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect
to, other potential target businesses. Thus, if we were unable to secure
additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business
combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate. Although
there are no existing written or oral agreements in place, or obligations on the
part of our existing stockholders, it is possible that our existing stockholders
could advance us the additional required funds, thereby increasing the amount of
excess out-of-pocket expenses to be reimbursed following a business combination.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

In addition to the above, we intend to use the interest earned on the trust
account and released to us for the payment of quarterly interest payments on the
convertible loan in the principal amount of $2,550,000 to be made prior to the
effective date of this offering ($3,157,500 in the event the over-allotment
option is exercised in full) and repayment of the convertible loan, for payment
of taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account and repayment of the
$475,000 term loan. We believe that the amount allocated to working capital,
together with interest earned on the trust account available to us, as described
above, will be sufficient to cover the costs related to the acquisition of a
target business and reimbursement costs, even if the costs of due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business
combination exceed our estimates.

As of the date of this prospectus, George Sagredos, our President, Chief
Operating Officer and a director has advanced to us a total of $300,000, which
was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee, AMEX Listing
fees, legal fees and expenses and an advance on Maxim’s non accountable expense
allowance. Such loan will be payable with 4% annual interest on the closing of
this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not
being placed in trust.

Four days prior to the effective date, Mr. Sagredos will loan us an additional
$475,000. Such loan will be placed in the trust account on the closing date of
this offering. Such loan bears interest at a per annum rate equivalent to the
per annum interest rate applied to the funds held in the trust account during
the same period that such loan is outstanding. Principal and accrued interest is
to be repaid from interest accrued on the trust account. The Company is not
obligated to repay such loan until the earlier of (i) expiration of the second
full quarter after the date that it has drawn down at least $1,000,000 from
accrued interest from the trust account to fund its working capital
requirements, (ii) the consummation of a business combination and (iii) our
dissolution and liquidation.

In addition, four days prior to the effective date of this offering, Robert
Ventures Limited, a company formed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands
which is controlled by George Sagredos, will loan us an additional $2,550,000 in
the form of a convertible loan ($3,157,500 if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full). Such loan bears interest at a per annum rate equivalent to
the per annum interest rate applied to the funds held in the trust account
during the quarterly period covered by such interest payment. We are obligated
to make quarterly interest payments on such loan following the expiration of the
first full quarter after the date that we have drawn down at least $1 million in
accrued interest on the trust account to fund our working capital requirements.
Such loan is due the earlier of our liquidation or the consummation of a
business combination. Quarterly interest payments and the repayment of principal
will be made from interest accrued on the trust account.

The $475,000 term loan and the $2,550,000 convertible loan ($3,157,500 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full) are being made so that a total of
$202,500,000 ($232,875,000 if the underwriters’ over allotment option is
exercised in full) will be in the trust account on the closing date of this
offering.

The repayment of each of the $475,000 term loan and the $2,550,000 convertible
loan ($3,157,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) is
subordinate to the public stockholders receiving a minimum of $10.00 per share,
subject to any valid claims by our creditors which are not covered by amounts in
the trust account or indemnities provided by our officers and directors, in the
event of our liquidation and dissolution if we do not consummate a business
combination, or if they exercise their redemption rights.

The Company has decided to treat the $300,000 loan which was made by Mr.
Sagredos in October 2005, and each of the $2,550,000 convertible loan
($3,157,500 if the over-allotment is exercised in full) and $475,000 term loan,
both to be made four days prior to the effective date of the offering, as
separate transactions because each of such loans, as described above, contains
different business terms with respect to the timing of repayment, applicable
interest rate and convertibility, due to the differing facts and circumstances
of the Company at the time such funds were required, which reflects the actual
sequencing of such transactions.

The funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of this
offering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed to be an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the
requirements of such act, in the event that the stockholders do not approve a
plan of dissolution and liquidation and the funds remain in the trust account
for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment
company and thus required to comply with such act.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, and receipt of interest on
the trust account (net of taxes payable), we will have sufficient available
funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

Other than options that we have agreed to grant to each of Messrs. Sagredos and
Theotokis, which vest following the consummation of a business combination, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, from us or from
any other party for any services rendered to us prior to or in connection with
the consummation of the business combination. Our existing stockholders will
only be entitled to receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf. To the extent that
such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless
we consummate a business combination, in which event this reimbursement
obligation would in all likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target
business. Since the role of present management after a business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, (net
of (i) taxes payable on interest earned, (ii) up to $3,363,000 ($3,665,000 if
the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of interest income released to
us to fund our working capital, (iii) payment of quarterly interest payments on
the convertible loan and repayment of the convertible loan upon the earlier to
occur of our dissolution and liquidation or a business combination, if not
converted, and (iv) repayment of the term loan, plus accrued interest), only in
the event of the liquidation of the trust account as part of our plan of
dissolution and liquidation approved by our stockholders upon our failure to
complete a business combination within the allotted time or if that public
stockholder were to seek to redeem such shares for cash in connection with a
business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we
actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

(1) $188,025 of the offering expenses have been paid from the initial investment 
    we received from our initial securityholders.                                

(2) The $250,000 allocated to legal, accounting and other third-party expenses of
    structuring and negotiating a business combination are amounts we expect to  
    pay to attorneys, accountants and other third parties we retain throughout   
    the process of structuring and negotiation of a business combination,        
    including due diligence, merger negotiations and regulatory filings and      
    approvals.                                                                   

$46,460,000, or $53,429,000 if the representative’s over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Lehman
Brothers Inc. maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York,
New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust fund
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or in connection
with a plan of dissolution. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination.

The payment to Danash Investment and Management Ltd., an entity wholly owned by
Mr. Gad, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and a Director,
of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative services including 
office space, utilities and administrative support. This arrangement is for 
our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Gad with compensation in lieu of
a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the 
Tel-Aviv, Israel metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Danash Investment 
and Management Ltd. is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an 
unaffiliated person.

We intend to use approximately $150,000 of the working capital allocation for
director and officer liability insurance premiums and hold the balance of
$440,000, or $697,175 if the representative’s over-allotment option is exercised
in full, in reserve in case due diligence, legal, accounting and other
third-party expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed
our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below. In addition, although we have no present intention to
do so, we could in the future find it necessary or desirable to use a portion of
these funds to make a down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in
letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for
transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target
businesses) with respect to a particular business combination. If so, any such
amount would be based on the terms of the specific business combination and the
amount of our available funds at the time. If we use a portion of our funds for
such a purpose and the related business combination does not occur and we are
required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the
agreement relating to the original payment or otherwise), we could, if such
payment was large enough and we had already used up the funds allocated to due
diligence and related expenses in connection with the aborted transaction, be
left with insufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence
with respect to, other potential target businesses.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund that are not used for such purpose, as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target business.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or cash
equivalents or be invested only in United States “government securities,”
defined as any Treasury Bill issued by within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Notwithstanding our belief
that we are not required to comply with the requirements of such act, in the
event that our stockholders do not approve a plan of dissolution and the
proceeds remain in the trust fund for an indeterminable amount of time, we may
be considered to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such
act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Danash Investment and
Management Ltd. the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and
consulting fees) will be paid to any of our initial securityholders, including
our officers and directors, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any
services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business
combination. However, they will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of accountable
out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us, which will be reviewed only by our
board (or by a court of competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is
challenged). Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

A Class B stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event there is no business combination or if that Class B stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the Class B stockholder voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a Class B stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund. Under no circumstances will
holders of common stock have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust fund."

repay a portion of our bank loan, which matures March 30, 2012, and through
March 31, 2006 carried an average floating rate of interest of 4.30%, and to use

contribution to Roma Bank to be used for general  business  purposes,  including
originating  loans and purchasing  securities,  as well as financing our de novo
branching plans and the possible acquisition of other financial  institutions or
financial  services  companies.  Our current plans call for the opening of up to
six de novo branches over approximately the next five years.

         We will also lend cash to Roma Bank's  employee stock ownership plan to
enable  the  plan  to buy up to 8% of  the  shares  sold  in  the  offering  and
contributed to the foundation.  The balance of the net proceeds will be retained
by Roma Financial Corporation and used for general business purposes,  which may
include  investment  in  securities,  repurchasing  shares of our common  stock,
paying cash  dividends,  supporting  acquisitions  or providing  funding for our
planned majority  investment in a de novo bank. Roma Financial  Corporation will
initially  invest  its  share  of the net  proceeds  in  short  term  investment
securities.

----------
         We are conducting  this stock offering  principally to raise capital to
support our  anticipated  future  growth.  The net  proceeds  will depend on the
expenses  incurred by us in connection with the offering and the total number of
shares of stock  issued in the  offering,  which will depend on the  independent
valuation and market  considerations.  Although the actual net proceeds from the
sale of the common stock cannot be  determined  until the offering is completed,
we  estimate  that net  proceeds  from the sale of common  stock will be between
$61.4 million and $83.4 million,  or $96.1 million at the adjusted maximum.  The
net proceeds may vary significantly because total expenses of the stock offering
may be significantly more or less than those estimated. Payments for shares made
through  withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at Roma Bank will not result
in the receipt of new funds for  investment  but will  result in a reduction  of
Roma  Bank's  deposits  and  interest  expense  as funds  are  transferred  from
interest-bearing certificates or other deposit accounts.    

         Roma  Financial  Corporation  intends to use the net proceeds  from the
offering as follows:

         We will use 50% of the net proceeds from the offering to make a capital
contribution  to Roma Bank.  We will also lend the Roma  Bank's  employee  stock
ownership plan cash to enable the plan to buy up to 8% of the shares sold in the
offering and contributed to the foundation. If the employee stock ownership plan
does not buy the full  amount  of its  intended  common  stock  purchase  in the
offering,  it may  purchase  shares of common stock in the open market after the
stock offering. If the purchase price of the common stock is higher than $10 per
share,  the amount of proceeds  required for the purchase by the employee  stock
ownership  plan  will  increase  and the  resulting  stockholders'  equity  will
decrease.  The balance of the net  proceeds  will be retained by Roma  Financial
Corporation and used for general business purposes, which may include investment
in securities, repurchasing shares of our common stock, paying cash dividends or
supporting  acquisitions.  However,  under current  regulations of the Office of
Thrift Supervision,  we may not repurchase shares of our common stock during the
first year  following the  offering,  except where  extraordinary  circumstances
exist  and with  prior  regulatory  approval.  We will  initially  invest  these
proceeds in short term investment securities."

    The bridge loans being repaid consist of principal and interest owed to a
group of lenders who provided us with short-term working capital in
January 2006. The loans, in a principal amount of $1,600,000, accrue interest at
an annual rate of 10% and are due and payable on the earlier of January 2007 or
the completion of a public offering of equity securities with gross proceeds of
at least $5,000,000.

    Design, building and testing of production line includes purchase and
installation of capital equipment, facility modifications, laboratory equipment,
test equipment, quality control equipment, and the labor associated with the
engineering, installation, commissioning, and product certification and test.

    Business development and product qualifications includes marketing
activities, preparation of customer bids and proposals, product prototypes,
product qualification and testing, and salaries and wages of associated staff.

    Research and technology development includes, internal research and
development projects, bid and proposal for research and development contracts,
performance of those contracts, and salaries and wages of associated scientists,
engineering, and technician staff.

    General corporate purposes consist of general and administrative costs,
including salaries, accounting and legal fees, rent and other facilities
expenses, and other working capital expenses.

    The foregoing information is an estimate based on our current business plan.
Other than repayment of the bridge loans, we may find it necessary to shift
funds reserved for one category of uses to another. For example, if our
non-recurring engineering and other costs exceed current estimates (due to sharp
increases in costs of materials or equipment), we may be forced to draw from
funds budgeted for research and technology development or business development.
In such cases, we may find it necessary or advisable to re-allocate portions of
the net proceeds we receive from this offering, and we will have broad
discretion in doing so. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds
of the offering in short-term, interest-bearing securities.

    Some of the net proceeds will be used to pay ITN for equipment and services
as detailed in our Service Center Agreement, Manufacturing Line Agreement,
Sublease Agreement and Administrative Services Agreement with ITN. Notably, in
connection with our contract with ITN to design and build our 500 kW/shift/year
production line, we have budgeted approximately $6,700,000 in payments to ITN
through 2007 for equipment, engineering, labor, plant commissioning, production
readiness and qualification. We also sublease approximately 9,500 square feet of
office and manufacturing space at cost from ITN and currently pay $11,997 per 
month (or a total of approximately $300,000 through 2007) in rent, plus 
pass-through expenses such as taxes, insurance, water and utilities, which we 
estimate will total approximately $250,000 for the subleased space through the 
end of 2007. ITN also has agreed to perform administrative services for us at 
cost, including services such as facilities maintenance, payroll, human 
resources, accounting and information technology services. Although actual 
costs may vary from month to month, we estimate that the average monthly cost 
of such services will be approximately $20,000. Payments to ITN under our 
Sublease Agreement and Administrative Service Center Agreement will draw from 
proceeds allocated to ""general corporate purposes."" A portion of proceeds 
allocated to ""business development and product qualification"" and ""research 
and technology development"" also may be paid to ITN under our Service Center 
Agreement, which gives us the right to use, on an as needed and as available 
basis, certain of ITN's laboratories, equipment and research and development 
tools. If and when we use the laboratories, equipment and tools, we will pay 
ITN in accordance with the standard rates that ITN charges its other customers."

     and proceeds from exercise of any warrants.                                 
    
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received
     from Marshall T. Reynolds appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. These     
     funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering.                  
    
(3)  Ferris, Baker Watts, Incorporated has agreed to deposit $1,032,000 (2.0% of 
     the gross proceeds, excluding the proceeds from any exercise of the         
     over-allotment option) attributable to the underwriters’ deferred           
     non-accountable expense allowance ($0.12 per Unit) into the trust account   
     until the completion of a business combination. Upon the consummation of a  
     business combination, we will pay such deferred non-accountable expense     
     allowance to the underwriters out of the proceeds of this offering held in  
     trust. They have further agreed to forfeit any rights to or claims against  
     such proceeds unless we successfully complete a business combination.       
    
(4)  At closing, Marshall T. Reynolds will loan the Company $150,000, which will 
     be deposited in the Company’s operating account. The loan will be repaid    
     without interest from working capital. This loan is separate and distinct   
     from the $150,000 loan made by Marshall T. Reynolds to the Company prior to 
     this offering, and a $75,000 advance for the payment of the American Stock  
     Exchange listing fee, which will be repaid without interest from the        
     offering proceeds.                                                          
    
(5)  Excludes $1,032,000 which represents the underwriters non-accountable       
     expense allowance and which is further described in footnote 3.             

    Our working capital will be generated solely from interest earned on the
amount held in trust. We will not use more than $1,200,000 of such interest (net
of taxes) to fund working capital. We believe the interest earned on the amount
held in trust will be sufficient to fund the operations of the Company. Since no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any existing stockholder or their affiliates, other than to Chapman Printing
Co., in connection with the general and administrative services arrangement for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of a 
business combination. The following table illustrates how we intend to use 
working capital funded from interest earned on the amount in trust.

(1)  Approximately $1,200,000 of working capital will be funded from the interest
     earned from the trust proceeds held in trust, net of taxes. The net proceeds
     of this offering held in the trust account will only be invested in United  
     States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury bill issued by the  
     United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less or in
     money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated   
     under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
     investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We believe that
     the interest earned from the trust proceeds held in trust will generate     
     sufficient funding to satisfy our working requirements.                     
    
(2)  At closing, Marshall T. Reynolds will loan the Company $150,000, which will 
     be deposited in the Company’s operating account. The loan will be repaid    
     without interest from working capital. This loan is separate and distinct   
     from the $150,000 loan and a $75,000 advance for the payment of the American
     Stock Exchange listing fee made by Marshall T. Reynolds to the Company prior
     to this offering, which will be repaid without interest from the offering   
     proceeds.                                                                   
    
(3)  The Company may reimburse its directors, officers, employees, stockholders  
     or their respective affiliates for any out-of-pocket expenses they incur in 
     connection with these items.                                                

    All of the net proceeds from the offering will be held in the trust. We do
not intend to use any material portion of the funds not held in the trust
account to make a deposit or fund a “no-shop, standstill” provision with respect
to a prospective business combination. However, if we elect to make such a
deposit or fund such a provision, it may materially impair our ability to search
for and locate a suitable target business. In the event we make such a deposit,
it will be made from funds generally earmarked as working capital generated from
interest on the trust account. Depending on the size of such payment and the
amount of funds already expended for due diligence and related expenses, our
forfeiture of such payments, whether as a result of our breach or otherwise, may
result in us not having sufficient funds to continue searching for or conducting
due diligence with respect to a target business or complete a business
combination. If we expend the funds not held in trust generated from interest on
the trust account that is available for working capital (up to $1,200,000),
management is not obligated to advance us any additional funds. Without
additional financing after such an event, we may be unable to complete a
business combination.

    $50,004,000 (including the $1,032,000 of the proceeds attributable to the
non-accountable expense allocation) or $57,279,600 if the underwriter’s
over-allotment option (including the $1,032,000 of the proceeds attributable to
the non-accountable expense allocation) is exercised in full, of net proceeds
will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers Inc. maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination and our liquidation; provided, however, the
proceeds held in trust may be used to pay income taxes owed by our company. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. The
underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $1,032,000 of the proceeds
attributable to their non-accountable expense allowance until the consummation
of a business combination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, we
will pay such deferred non-accountable expense allowance to the underwriters out
of the proceeds of this offering held in trust. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business or to the underwriters for
deferred underwriting fees and expenses may be used to finance operations of the
target business. We expect that the operating expenses of a target business may
include some or all of the following: capital expenditures, expenditures for
future projects, general ongoing expenses including supplies and payroll,
expanding markets and strategic acquisitions or alliances.

    The Company shall pay to Chapman Printing Co., an entity associated with and
owned in part by Marshall T. Reynolds, up to $5,000 per month for reimbursable
expenses (such as administrative expenses, and postage and telephone expenses)
at cost. This arrangement is being agreed to by Chapman Printing Co., for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Marshall T. Reynolds with compensation in
lieu of salary.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

    Marshall T. Reynolds, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer,
has advanced to us $150,000, on a non-interest bearing basis, which was used to
pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items
above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and
expenses. On August 28, 2006, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer advanced
the Company an additional $75,000 for the payment of offering expenses. The
advances will be payable at the consummation of this offering and will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering. In addition, Mr. Reynolds will loan the
Company $150,000 at closing, which will be repaid without interest from working
capital.

    The working capital not held in the trust account and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United
States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The interest income derived
from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed. The interest rate earned on the trust
account will be the prevailing interest rate on short-term United States
treasury securities and money market funds that comply with certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These rates will vary
from time to time. On August 30, 2006, the yield on three month treasury bills
was approximately 5.041% per annum. Based on such prevailing rates, we believe
that the income received by the trust fund will be sufficient to provide the
contemplated amount of working capital. Until we receive interest income
generated from the proceeds held in trust, approximately 30 days from the date
of this offering, our initial cash expenses will be funded through a loan from
our Chairman of the Board. We believe that payments for most of our initial
expenses will not become due until after we receive our first interest payment
from the trust account.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time. Moreover, we do not
anticipate any changes from the use of proceeds, as described above.

    We intend to allocate a portion of the working capital for expenses incurred
in examining and evaluating prospective target businesses. Marshall T. Reynolds
will supervise this process and we expect that he will devote substantial time
to our business once we have signed a letter of intent or agreement in principle
with a target business that provides for a business combination conditioned
upon, among other things, the completion of due diligence. We anticipate that
Marshall T. Reynolds will be assisted in his efforts by the Company, together 
with the Company’s outside attorneys, accountants and other lead managers. We 
will not pay compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) 
to the Company’s directors, officers, employees, stockholders or their 
respective affiliates in connection with their performance of due diligence of 
prospective target companies. However, they will receive reimbursement, at 
cost, for any actual out-of-pocket expenses they incur in conducting due diligence.

    No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, other than
to Chapman Printing, Co., in connection with the general and administrative
services arrangement for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with
the consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders
will receive reimbursement, at cost, for any actual out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. In the event that a business combination is consummated,
then such out-of pocket expenses will become obligations of the post-business
combination entity.

    Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation
of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Chapman Printing Co. the
expenses described above. Other than the reimbursement of expenses, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our initial stockholders, our officers or directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, they will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. These reimbursements
may be paid from the $200,000 allocated for due diligence. Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

    A public stockholder will receive funds from the trust account (including
interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the
event of our dissolution and liquidation (assuming there are no outstanding
claims against the trust) or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert
such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

---------
(1)   Excludes the payment of $25,000 from the initial stockholders in connection 
      with their purchase of the founders’ common stock.                          

(2)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from advances we received 
      from Mr. Gross described below. These advances will be repaid out of the    
      proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of    
      this offering.                                                              

(3)   These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
      of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
      we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
      estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
      combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination.
      We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
      fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
      fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
      category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.    

(4)   Approximately $3,900,000 of working capital will be funded from the interest
      earned from the net proceeds held in the trust account. The net proceeds of 
      this offering held in the trust account will only be invested in United     
      States “government securities,” (as such term is defined in the Investment  
      Company Act of 1940) and one or more money market funds, selected by us,    
      which invest principally in either short-term securities issued or          
      guaranteed by the United States having a rating in the highest investment   
      category granted thereby by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
      acquisition or tax exempt municipal bonds issued by governmental entities   
      located within the United States or otherwise meeting certain conditions    
      under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We    
      believe that the interest earned from the trust proceeds held in trust will 
      generate sufficient funding to satisfy our working requirements. Because the
      initial working capital of $100,000 is being funded from proceeds of this   
      offering, we do not expect that we will need to rely on advances from our   
      management team prior to the receipt of interest earned from the proceeds   
      held in trust.                                                              

(5)   Miscellaneous expenses include additional expenses that may be incurred by  
      us in connection with this offering over and above those specifically listed
      above, including distribution and mailing costs.                            

A total of approximately $289.6 million (or approximately $332.3 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in this
prospectus, including $6.0 million (or $6.9 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions will be placed in a trust account at The Bank of New York with
The Bank of New York, as trustee. Except for a portion of the interest income
released to us, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. All amounts held in the trust account that are not converted to
cash or released to us as interest income will be released on closing of our
initial business combination with one or more target businesses which have a
fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding
deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.0 million or $6.9 million
if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the time of such business
combination, subject to a majority of our public stockholders voting in favor of
the business combination and less than 20% of the public stockholders electing
their conversion rights and subject to such deferred underwriting discount and
commission having been paid to the underwriters. On release of funds from the
trust account and after payment of the conversion price to any public
stockholders who exercise their conversion rights, the underwriters will receive
their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, and the remaining funds
will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase
price of the business or businesses with which our initial combination occurs.
If the business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, we may
apply the cash released to us from the trust account to general corporate
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired
business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness
incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase
of other companies, or for working capital.

We have agreed to pay Marathon Management, LLC, an entity owned and controlled
by Mr. Gross, a total of $7,500 per month for office space, administrative
services and secretarial support. Mr. Gross is our chairman and chief executive
officer. This arrangement is being agreed to us by Marathon Management, LLC for
our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Gross compensation in lieu of a
salary or other remuneration because it is anticipated that the expenses to be
paid by Marathon Management, LLC will approximate the monthly
reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of the members of our management team and may include engaging
market research firms and/or third party consultants. Members of our management
team, or their affiliates or associates, will not receive any compensation for
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection
with such due diligence activities. Our audit committee will review and approve
all expense reimbursements made to any member of our management team and any
expense reimbursements payable to members of our audit committee will be
reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the interested director or
directors abstaining from such review and approval.

We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income of up
to $3.9 million earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us
subject to the tax holdback (as described in more detail below) will be
sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated.
This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken
only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary
agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our
estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a
business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may
be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of
which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us.

If we complete a business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
members of our management team prior to the business combination’s closing will
become an obligation of the post-combination business, assuming these
out-of-pocket expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing. These
expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would be
treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined
business. Members of our management team may, as part of any such combination,
negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the target
business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our management
team to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in a
conflict of interest.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

As of the date of this prospectus, Mr. Gross has advanced to us a total of
$225,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, NASD
registration fee, American Stock Exchange fee and accounting and legal fees and
expenses. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of December 31, 2006 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities” (as such term is defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940) and one or more money market funds, selected by us, which
invest principally in either short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the
United States having a rating in the highest investment category granted thereby
by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or tax exempt
municipal bonds issued by governmental entities located within the United States
and otherwise meeting the conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Interest income of up to $3.9 million
on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the trust account to fund
a portion of our working capital requirements, subject to the tax holdback.

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) will be paid to members of our management team, or any of their 
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the 
consummation of the business combination. However, members of our management 
team will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by 
them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying 
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest income of up to $3.9
million that is released to us from the trust account (subject to the tax
holdback), such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us prior to
our consummation of a business combination. In the event a business combination
is consummated by us and irrespective of whether such persons remain associated
with us, our audit committee and/or our board of directors may determine to
reimburse such persons for such expenses. There is no limit on the amount of
such expenses reimbursable by us to such persons.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less interest income
released to us from the trust account in the manner described above) only in the
event of our liquidation if we fail to complete a business combination within
the allotted time or if the public stockholder seeks to convert such shares into
cash in connection with a business combination that the public stockholder voted
against and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust
account.

On completion of an initial business combination, the underwriters will receive
the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust account.
If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee must
therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation, the
underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interest
thereon, in the trust account, and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to
distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with
any accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, to
the public stockholders on a pro rata basis."

our common stock we are offering at the initial public offering price of $9.00
per share will be approximately $56.4 million after deducting the underwriting
discounts and estimated expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering primarily to expand our
sales force, to acquire or make strategic investments in complementary
businesses and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of
the date of this prospectus, we have no binding commitment or agreement relating
to any acquisition or investment. We have not yet determined the amount of our
net proceeds to be used specifically for any of the foregoing purposes.
Accordingly, management will have significant flexibility in applying our net
proceeds of this offering. We also intend to use a portion of our net proceeds
from this offering to repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest owed
under our line of credit with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The amounts borrowed
under our line of credit are due in full on June 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2006,
the outstanding indebtedness under our line of credit was $2.5 million, which
bears interest at the prime rate. We used the borrowings under our line of
credit during 2005 for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In
addition to the foregoing purposes, we intend to use approximately $7.0 million
of our net proceeds from this offering to make required preference and accrued
dividend payments to the former holders of our Series B, D and E preferred
shares. Pending their use, we intend to invest the balance of our net proceeds
from this offering in short-term, investment grade interest-bearing instruments."

underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses, will be
approximately $70.2 million, or $81.8 million if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional shares. We intend to use $30 million of
these proceeds to repay all of our outstanding borrowings under our credit
agreement, $6.05 million to repay the non-interest bearing notes to be issued as
a portion of the consideration for the Protego Combination and the remaining
$34.2 million to expand and diversify our advisory and investment management
businesses and for general corporate purposes. Pending specific application of
the net proceeds, we expect to use the net proceeds to purchase U.S. Government
securities, other short-term, highly-rated debt securities and money market
funds.

Our credit agreement is a 364-day $30.0 million revolving line of credit that
matures on the earlier of the consummation of this offering and December 31,
2006. As of July 31, 2006, we had outstanding borrowings of $30.0 million under
our credit agreement bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 7.4%.
Proceeds from these borrowings have been used for working capital purposes
including funding of our ongoing investment management activities.

Affiliates of Lehman Brothers Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Goldman,
Sachs & Co. are the lenders under our credit agreement and will, accordingly,
indirectly receive the proceeds used to repay those borrowings."

exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase ADSs from Infineon.

    We currently intend to use the net offering proceeds we expect to receive
from this offering to finance investments in our manufacturing facilities and
for research and development. We plan to invest between €200 million and
€250 million to expand our manufacturing capacity and improve our manufacturing
efficiency, primarily at our 300mm manufacturing facility in Richmond, Virginia,
and to a lesser extent at our backend facilities in Porto, Portugal and Suzhou,
China. We plan to invest up to approximately €75 million for capacity upgrades
at our 300mm manufacturing facility in Dresden, Germany. We expect to invest the
remaining net offering proceeds in equipment for technology and product research
and development at our R&D locations in Dresden, Germany and Xi’an, China and
our R&D locations in North America. We anticipate that it will take us
approximately one year to make these investments. Pending application of the
proceeds, we intend to invest them in short term liquid investments. We plan to
manage the exchange rate risk arising from these short term investments using
currency market instruments."

As of August 3, 2006, we had $251.0 million outstanding under Credit Facility
No. 2, which is scheduled to mature on November 15, 2007. Borrowings under
Credit Facility No. 2 bear interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.25% which
at August 3, 2006 was 6.63% per annum. Borrowings under Credit Facility No. 2
were used to finance a portion of the net book value of certain of our aircraft.
Amounts repaid under Credit Facility No. 2 may be reborrowed from time to time,
subject to compliance with borrowing conditions. Certain of the underwriters or

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

    We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash 
on hand of approximately $11.0 million resulting from termination of an 
interest rate swap and reserve accounts related to MainLine's term loan, to: 

• repay all outstanding indebtedness under MainLine's term loan. The term loan 
was incurred on December 17, 2004. As of August 3, 2006, the amount outstanding 
under the term loan, including accrued interest, was $169.7 million. The term 
loan bears interest at our option at a floating rate equal to either the prime 
rate or Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin and matures on December 
17, 2011. As of March 31, 2006, the interest rate on amounts outstanding 
under the term loan was 7.31% before accounting for the impact of outstanding 
interest rate swap agreements; 

• pay approximately $1.9 million of transaction expenses associated with the 
offering; and 

• make distributions to our current equity owners with the balance of the net 
proceeds, currently estimated to be approximately $7.7 million. The 
distributions will be made in accordance with the distribution provisions of 
MainLine's partnership agreement, as if our current equity owners continued 
to own their Class A and Class B units in MainLine. Our current equity owners are: 

• MainLine Management LLC, our general partner; 

• Carlyle/Riverstone BPL Holdings II, L.P., an entity controlled by CRF;

approximately $34.2 million, or $39.6 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

    We intend to use the net proceeds to us from the offering to pay:

        º Approximately $13 million for conducting a Phase III clinical trial
          for Prochymal to treat steroid refractory GvHD;

        º Approximately $3 million for initiating a Phase III clinical trial for
          Chondrogen;

        º Approximately $10 million in total for completing separate Phase II
          clinical trials for Prochymal to treat acute GvHD and Crohn's disease,
          a Phase I/II clinical trial for Chondrogen and a Phase I clinical
          trial for Provacel; and

        º Approximately $3 million for preclinical and other clinical research
          and development relating to our biologic drug candidates.

    We intend to use the balance of the proceeds for other general corporate
purposes, including working capital needs and potential acquisitions of
technologies or businesses, and, if not required for other needs, for early
repayment of principal and interest on a promissory note.

    We believe that the proceeds from this offering together with our current
resources will allow us to complete a Phase III clinical trial for the use of
Prochymal to treat steroid refractory Graft versus Host Disease, or GvHD,
separate Phase II clinical trials for the use of Prochymal to treat acute GvHD
and Crohn's Disease, a Phase I/II clinical trial for Chondrogen and a Phase I
clinical trial for Provacel. We also intend to initiate and conduct additional
clinical trials as discussed below under ""Business."" There can be no assurance
that the proceeds of this offering will allow us to achieve any of these
results. Our ability to complete each of these trials depends on factors outside
of our control. These factors are described under ""Risk Factors.""

    The above-referenced promissory note matures on November 28, 2008 and is
prepayable by us without penalty. The full $20.6 million of principal currently
remains outstanding, and since its issuance on November 28, 2005, the note has
accrued interest at a rate of 6% per annum. The note also has a redemption
premium of 9%, which increases over time to 27% by maturity.

    We are not obligated to use the net proceeds from this offering for any
particular purpose, and the amounts and timing of our actual use of proceeds
will depend upon numerous factors, including the actual amount of net proceeds
from this offering as well as cash flows from operations, the growth of our
business and other factors described under ""Risk Factors."" Also, although we
periodically evaluate acquisition and licensing opportunities, and we may choose
to pursue an acquisition or licensing transaction, we currently have no
commitments or agreements with respect to any specific acquisition or additional
license. As a result, we cannot specify with certainty the amounts that we may
allocate to the particular uses of the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management will have significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net
proceeds of this offering. Pending any use, we will invest the net proceeds of
this offering generally in short-term, investment grade, interest bearing
securities but cannot predict that these investments will yield a favorable
return."

offering costs payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately
$374.3 million, based upon the initial public offering price of $22.00 per

    The principal purposes of this offering are to repay a portion of our
indebtedness, make a payment in connection with termination of our sponsor
management agreements, establish a public market for our common stock,
facilitate our future access to public markets and provide liquidity for
existing stockholders. We intend to use $323.8 million of the net proceeds from
this offering to repay the principal outstanding under our second-lien term
loans. In connection with this repayment of the second-lien term loans, an
affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. will receive approximately $15.0 million in
its capacity as a lender. In addition, concurrently with the completion of this
offering, we intend to refinance a portion of our debt by borrowing up to
$135.0 million of additional first-lien term loans and using the net proceeds
from these additional borrowings to repay our 15% senior subordinated notes
which mature in June 2014. After application of the net proceeds of this
offering and the concurrent refinancing of a portion of our debt, we expect to
have a total of approximately $389.9 million in outstanding indebtedness. We
intend to pay an aggregate of $1.8 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to Berkshire Partners LLC and JH Partners, LLC as consideration for the
termination of our management agreements with them.

    As of July 2, 2006, our senior secured credit facilities consisted of a
$25.0 million revolving credit facility under which no borrowings are
outstanding, an aggregate of $354.8 million in first-lien term loans and an
aggregate of $234.0 million in second-lien term loans. The revolving credit
facility matures in February 2011, the first-lien term loans mature in
February 2012 and the second-lien term loans mature in February 2013. Borrowings
under the revolving credit facility and the first-lien term loans bear interest
at a rate equal to, at our option, either LIBOR or the lender's base rate, plus
an applicable variable margin based on our consolidated total leverage ratio.
Borrowings under the second-lien term loans generally bear interest at a rate
equal to, at our option, either 7.0% over LIBOR or 6.0% over the lender's base
rate. As of July 2, 2006, interest on the first-lien term loans was accruing at
an annual rate of 10.0% and interest on the second-lien term loans was accruing
at a blended annual rate of 12.4%. We incurred indebtedness under our senior
secured credit facilities to fund our February 2005 recapitalization, our
October 2005 recapitalization, our June 2006 recapitalization, refinance amounts
borrowed in connection with our June 2004 recapitalization and for working
capital purposes. Our first-lien term loan facility generally requires us to use
proceeds from the sale of equity securities to prepay the first-lien term loan;
provided, that subject to certain conditions, including maintenance of certain
financial ratios, we may use the offering proceeds to prepay our 15.0% senior
subordinated notes and our second-lien term loans. In September 2006, we amended
our senior secured credit facilities to permit the issuance of up to
$135.0 million in additional first-lien term loans, as described above."

stockholders, we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by
the selling stockholders, although we will bear the costs, other than
underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with those sales.

    We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate
purposes, including working capital and potential capital expenditures for
manufacturing and website infrastructure equipment and new and existing
manufacturing facilities. We expect our capital expenditures to be between
$30 million and $35 million in the second half of 2006 and through 2007, which
will be funded by a combination of our cash and cash equivalents, expected cash
flows from operations and the net proceeds from this offering. We expect to
spend approximately half of this amount to purchase manufacturing equipment,
obtain new manufacturing facilities and on improvements to our new and existing
manufacturing facilities, with the remainder to be allocated for the purchase of
website infrastructure equipment. Although we may also use a portion of the net
proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies,
products or assets that complement our business, we have no present
understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or make
any investments.

    Our management will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of the
net proceeds of this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of
our management regarding the application of these net proceeds. Pending specific
utilization of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the United States. The goal with respect to the investment of
these net proceeds will be capital preservation and liquidity so that such funds
are readily available to fund our operations."

We are often engaged in preliminary discussions with acquisition candidates. As
of the date of this prospectus, we have no binding commitments or agreements to
enter into any acquisitions.

We expect to refinance our revolving credit facility and two term loan
facilities in connection with the completion of this offering. Those facilities
include:

†   An $8 million short-term term loan facility that matures in January 2007      
    (sometimes referred to herein as the time loan facility). As of August 25,    
    2006, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $7.7 million.  

†   A $22 million term loan facility that matures in October 2010. As of August   
    25, 2006, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $18.7      
    million.                                                                      

†   A revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to the lesser of $65  
    million or the applicable borrowing base comprised of eligible billed         
    receivables and matures in October 2010. As of August 25, 2006, the principal 
    amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility was $13.6 million.     

Our credit agreement requires that we apply the net proceeds to us from this
offering, after payment of the $2.7 million in one-time bonuses described above,
to reduce, respectively, the outstanding principal balances of our short-term
term loan facility, our term loan facility and, if proceeds are available, our
revolving credit facility.

The indebtedness to be repaid under our short-term term loan facility, our term
loan facility and our revolving credit facility bears interest at rates equal to
an applicable margin, or spread, plus, at our option, either a base rate equal
to the U.S. prime rate or a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the interest
period relevant to the indebtedness. The applicable margins for base rate
indebtedness and applicable spread for LIBOR rate indebtedness under the
short-term term loan and term loan facilities and the revolving credit loan
facility are variable subject to certain leverage ratio tests. As of August 25,
2006, the base rate margin and LIBOR spread were 0.50% and 3.50%, respectively,
for borrowings under the short-term term loan facility; 0.25% and 3.00%,
respectively, for borrowings under the term loan facility; and 0.25% and 3.00%,
respectively, for borrowings under the revolving credit facility.

A substantial amount of the debt to be repaid with the proceeds of the offering
was incurred in 2005 in connection with the Synergy and Caliber acquisitions and
the repayment of $6.4 million of subordinated debt due to our former parent. In
connection with the Synergy acquisition in January 2005, we increased
the capacity under our credit facilities by $10 million. In October 2005, in
connection with the Caliber acquisition and the repayment of debt to our former
parent, we increased the capacity under our credit facilities by an additional
$25 million.

investments may have a material adverse effect on the US federal income tax
consequences of your investment in our ADSs. In particular, it is possible that
we may become a passive foreign investment company for United States federal
income tax purposes, which could result in negative tax consequences for you.

(and/or have not been paid for services billed, or salaries earned) amounts
totaling approximately $1,730,000 as of August 31, 2006. Approximately $110,000
of this debt carries an annual interest rate of approximately 11%. The rest is
interest free. Substantially all the debt matures July 1, 2007. Of the
$1,730,000 total, approximately $890,000 was incurred through the year ended
December 31, 2005, and is deferred compensation of key employees (""2005 deferred
compensation""). If only the minimum of $2,450,000 is raised in this offering,
these persons have agreed to continue to defer receipt of their 2005 deferred
compensation at least through July 1, 2007, as provided in ""EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION-Deferral of Compensation"", page 51. If the maximum of $14,000,000
is raised in this offering, more than half of the accumulated deferred
compensation for the periods through December 31, 2005 will be paid out of the
proceeds received. If an amount between the minimum and the maximum is raised,
portions of the outstanding accounts payable will be exchanged for shares and/or
deferred and the remainder paid, based upon the amount raised and our other
financial conditions at the time of the termination of this offering.

We intend to use most of the net proceeds of this offering for geological and
geophysical studies and exploration and development drilling on our Israeli
license and permit areas. Our work program calls for the completion and testing
of an existing well (the Ma'anit #1) at an estimated cost of $800,000 to
$1,000,000 and the drilling of an appraisal/deep exploratory well in the license
area at an estimated ""dry hole"" cost of $7,400,000 to $9,100,000 to drill to a
total depth of approximately 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) to 5,500 meters (18,045
feet). We intend to evaluate the new well through a combination of electrical
wireline tool investigations, recovery of samples from the target formation
(coring) and testing. A ""dry hole"" is a well that for either geological or
mechanical reasons is judged by us to be incapable of producing oil or gas in
commercial quantities. If any well is not a ""dry hole"", a completion attempt
would be made at an estimated completion cost of $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 in 
order to set production casing, perforate, install the production tubing and 
wellhead and conduct extended tests of the well. We cannot assure you that any 
wells will be completed or produce oil or gas in commercial quantities. If the 
minimum of approximately $2,000,000 net proceeds are raised, we will attempt 
to complete the Ma'anit #1. If the maximum of approximately $12,400,000 net 
proceeds are raised, we may drill an offset appraisal well to the Ma'anit #1 
well or combination appraisal/deep exploration well offsetting the Ma'anit #1 
before attempting to complete the Ma'anit #1. 

Our engineers estimate that, in order to be commercially productive, any of the
wells we intend to drill to the approximate depth of 5,000 meters (16,400 feet),
based on industry standards, should be capable of producing at least 100 barrels
of oil per day or 600 thousand cubic feet of gas per day. Such production levels
will not pay out the cost of drilling the well, but only the costs of operating
the well on a current basis. In order to justify the costs of drilling of
additional wells, there should be the expectation that each additional well
would have initial production rates in excess of 1,000 barrels of oil per day or
six million cubic feet of gas per day, or some combination of the two, based
upon minimum oil prices of $25.00 per barrel and a minimum gas price of $3.00
per thousand cubic feet. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general and
administrative expenses and working capital. We intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment grade obligations or bank
certificates of deposit in both Israel and the United States until they are
used.

If the minimum amount is raised in this offering and assuming that the we are
able to raise an additional approximate amount of $1,250,000 in net available
funds from additional sources including currently open offerings to non-United
States residents under Regulation S promulgated by the SEC and the exercise of
warrants expiring on December 31, 2006 (which warrants are not required to be
exercised), the proceeds from this offering will satisfy our cash requirements
through June 2007, including the completion attempt of the Ma'anit #1. This
assumes that our officers would be willing, as they have done in the past, to
defer some of their salaries until more cash is available. Thereafter, it will
be necessary to raise additional funds for subsequent drilling. Out of the net
proceeds of $2,000,000 in this minimum case, $900,000 would be used for general
and administrative expenses (mostly salaries and professional fees), $900,000
would be available for the completion attempt on the first well and $200,000
would be set aside for contingencies on the completion attempt and exploration
activities. Following completion of the first well, we will install gas
separation facilities and storage tanks at an estimated cost of $600,000, which
will be paid from other funds (such as borrowings or the proceeds from exercises
of outstanding warrants expiring December 31, 2006) and not from the net
proceeds of this offering.

To the extent this offering is successful in raising the maximum funds, we
expect to have sufficient money to drill a new well to at least 17,000 feet,
complete the Ma'anit #1, and pay overhead through June 2007. Funds for the
completion of the new well, if successful, would have to come from other
sources, including the exercise of outstanding warrants that expire December 31,
2006 (which warrants are not required to be exercised). Out of the net proceeds
of $12,400,000, we would spend up to $600,000 to repay some of our outstanding
notes and accounts payable to shareholders and officers. For the period ending
June 30, 2007, we estimate that our general and administrative expenses will be 
$2,050,000, most of which would be spent on salaries, benefits and professional 
fees. With the maximum funds available, we estimate that we would spend $500,000 
on geological and geophysical studies in our license and permit areas (including 
approximately $100,000 annually to maintain our current license and permit). 
We would spend up to $8,800,000 to drill a second well (including $1,000,000 set 
aside for drilling contingencies), $300,000 to complete the Ma'anit #1, $50,000 
to set up the charitable trusts, and would reserve the remaining $100,000 for 
long lead time equipment required to complete the second well.

Our estimates for general and administrative costs below increase substantially
from the minimum to the maximum case. This occurs because the maximum case would
cause us to have a higher activity level, resulting in some higher expenses. Our
salaries and benefits also increase substantially in the maximum case because we
will be able to pay our officers and directors on a current basis, rather than
on the deferred basis required by the minimum case. We would also need a larger
staff for the increased activity. None of our experts, consultants, accountants,
or legal counsel has been hired on a contingent fee basis.

Our position is that the additional funds paid to our officers and directors in
the event of a maximum offering should not be considered compensation for their
selling our shares in the offering because their basic compensation rates remain
unchanged in either case. The only difference is that in the case of minimum
offering some of our officers would be working less than full time for less than
full salary. They would most likely also be deferring part of that salary as
well.

certificates of deposit in both Israel and the United States until they are
used.

If the minimum amount is raised in this offering and assuming that the we are
able to raise an additional approximate amount of $1,250,000 in net available
funds from additional sources including currently open offerings to non-United
States residents under Regulation S promulgated by the SEC and the exercise of
warrants expiring on December 31, 2006 (which warrants are not required to be
exercised), the proceeds from this offering will satisfy our cash requirements
through June 2007, including the completion attempt of the Ma'anit #1. This
assumes that our officers would be willing, as they have done in the past, to
defer some of their salaries until more cash is available. Thereafter, it will
be necessary to raise additional funds for subsequent drilling. Out of the net
proceeds of $2,000,000 in this minimum case, $900,000 would be used for general
and administrative expenses (mostly salaries and professional fees), $900,000
would be available for the completion attempt on the first well and $200,000
would be set aside for contingencies on the completion attempt and exploration
activities. Following completion of the first well, we will install gas
separation facilities and storage tanks at an estimated cost of $600,000, which
will be paid from other funds (such as borrowings or the proceeds from exercises
of outstanding warrants expiring December 31, 2006) and not from the net
proceeds of this offering.

To the extent this offering is successful in raising the maximum funds, we
expect to have sufficient money to drill a new well to at least 17,000 feet,
complete the Ma'anit #1, and pay overhead through June 2007. Funds for the
completion of the new well, if successful, would have to come from other
sources, including the exercise of outstanding warrants that expire December 31,
2006 (which warrants are not required to be exercised). Out of the net proceeds
of $12,400,000, we would spend up to $600,000 to repay some of our outstanding
notes and accounts payable to shareholders and officers. For the period ending
June 30, 2007, we estimate that our general and administrative expenses will be 
$2,050,000, most of which would be spent on salaries, benefits and professional 
fees. With the maximum funds available, we estimate that we would spend $500,000 
on geological and geophysical studies in our license and permit areas (including 
approximately $100,000 annually to maintain our current license and permit). 
We would spend up to $8,800,000 to drill a second well (including $1,000,000 set 
aside for drilling contingencies), $300,000 to complete the Ma'anit #1, $50,000 
to set up the charitable trusts, and would reserve the remaining $100,000 for 
long lead time equipment required to complete the second well.

Our estimates for general and administrative costs below increase substantially
from the minimum to the maximum case. This occurs because the maximum case would
cause us to have a higher activity level, resulting in some higher expenses. Our
salaries and benefits also increase substantially in the maximum case because we
will be able to pay our officers and directors on a current basis, rather than
on the deferred basis required by the minimum case. We would also need a larger
staff for the increased activity. None of our experts, consultants, accountants,
or legal counsel has been hired on a contingent fee basis.

Our position is that the additional funds paid to our officers and directors in
the event of a maximum offering should not be considered compensation for their
selling our shares in the offering because their basic compensation rates remain
unchanged in either case. The only difference is that in the case of minimum
offering some of our officers would be working less than full time for less than
full salary. They would most likely also be deferring part of that salary as
well.

2,000,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $7.00 per share are
estimated to be approximately $2,000,000 and $12,400,000, respectively, after
deducting estimated placement agent commissions and offering expenses.

Some of our officers, directors, their affiliates and associates have loaned
(and/or have not been paid for services billed, or salaries earned) amounts
totaling approximately $1,730,000 as of August 31, 2006. Approximately $110,000
of this debt carries an annual interest rate of approximately 11%. The rest is
interest free. Substantially all the debt matures July 1, 2007. Of the
$1,730,000 total, approximately $890,000 was incurred through the year ended
December 31, 2005, and is deferred compensation of key employees (""2005 deferred
compensation""). If only the minimum of $2,450,000 is raised in this offering,
these persons have agreed to continue to defer receipt of their 2005 deferred
compensation at least through July 1, 2007, as provided in ""EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION-Deferral of Compensation"", page 51. If the maximum of $14,000,000
is raised in this offering, more than half of the accumulated deferred
compensation for the periods through December 31, 2005 will be paid out of the
proceeds received. If an amount between the minimum and the maximum is raised,
portions of the outstanding accounts payable will be exchanged for shares and/or
deferred and the remainder paid, based upon the amount raised and our other
financial conditions at the time of the termination of this offering.

We intend to use most of the net proceeds of this offering for geological and
geophysical studies and exploration and development drilling on our Israeli
license and permit areas. Our work program calls for the completion and testing
of an existing well (the Ma'anit #1) at an estimated cost of $800,000 to
$1,000,000 and the drilling of an appraisal/deep exploratory well in the license
area at an estimated ""dry hole"" cost of $7,400,000 to $9,100,000 to drill to a
total depth of approximately 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) to 5,500 meters (18,045
feet). We intend to evaluate the new well through a combination of electrical
wireline tool investigations, recovery of samples from the target formation
(coring) and testing. A ""dry hole"" is a well that for either geological or
mechanical reasons is judged by us to be incapable of producing oil or gas in
commercial quantities. If any well is not a ""dry hole"", a completion attempt
would be made at an estimated completion cost of $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 in 
order to set production casing, perforate, install the production tubing and 
wellhead and conduct extended tests of the well. We cannot assure you that any 
wells will be completed or produce oil or gas in commercial quantities. If the 
minimum of approximately $2,000,000 net proceeds are raised, we will attempt 
to complete the Ma'anit #1. If the maximum of approximately $12,400,000 net 
proceeds are raised, we may drill an offset appraisal well to the Ma'anit #1 
well or combination appraisal/deep exploration well offsetting the Ma'anit #1 
before attempting to complete the Ma'anit #1. 

Our engineers estimate that, in order to be commercially productive, any of the
wells we intend to drill to the approximate depth of 5,000 meters (16,400 feet),
based on industry standards, should be capable of producing at least 100 barrels
of oil per day or 600 thousand cubic feet of gas per day. Such production levels
will not pay out the cost of drilling the well, but only the costs of operating
the well on a current basis. In order to justify the costs of drilling of
additional wells, there should be the expectation that each additional well
would have initial production rates in excess of 1,000 barrels of oil per day or
six million cubic feet of gas per day, or some combination of the two, based
upon minimum oil prices of $25.00 per barrel and a minimum gas price of $3.00
per thousand cubic feet. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general and
administrative expenses and working capital. We intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment grade obligations or bank
certificates of deposit in both Israel and the United States until they are
used.

If the minimum amount is raised in this offering and assuming that the we are
able to raise an additional approximate amount of $1,250,000 in net available
funds from additional sources including currently open offerings to non-United
States residents under Regulation S promulgated by the SEC and the exercise of

ZION OIL & GAS INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/zion-oil-gas-inc-95561-48302,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/zion-oil-gas-inc-95561-48302,424B3,1/9/2007,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4870850,"The net proceeds to us from the sale of a minimum of 350,000 and a maximum of
2,000,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $7.00 per share are
estimated to be approximately $2,000,000 and $12,400,000, respectively, after
deducting estimated placement agent commissions and offering expenses.

Some of our officers, directors, their affiliates and associates have loaned
(and/or have not been paid for services billed, or salaries earned) amounts
totaling approximately $1,730,000 as of August 31, 2006. Approximately $110,000
of this debt carries an annual interest rate of approximately 11%. The rest is
interest free. Substantially all the debt matures July 1, 2007. Of the
$1,730,000 total, approximately $890,000 was incurred through the year ended
December 31, 2005, and is deferred compensation of key employees (""2005 deferred
compensation""). If only the minimum of $2,450,000 is raised in this offering,
these persons have agreed to continue to defer receipt of their 2005 deferred
compensation at least through July 1, 2007, as provided in ""EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION-Deferral of Compensation"", page 51. If the maximum of $14,000,000
is raised in this offering, more than half of the accumulated deferred
compensation for the periods through December 31, 2005 will be paid out of the
proceeds received. If an amount between the minimum and the maximum is raised,
portions of the outstanding accounts payable will be exchanged for shares and/or
deferred and the remainder paid, based upon the amount raised and our other
financial conditions at the time of the termination of this offering.

We intend to use most of the net proceeds of this offering for geological and
geophysical studies and exploration and development drilling on our Israeli
license and permit areas. Our work program calls for the completion and testing
of an existing well (the Ma'anit #1) at an estimated cost of $800,000 to
$1,000,000 and the drilling of an appraisal/deep exploratory well in the license
area at an estimated ""dry hole"" cost of $7,400,000 to $9,100,000 to drill to a
total depth of approximately 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) to 5,500 meters (18,045
feet). We intend to evaluate the new well through a combination of electrical
wireline tool investigations, recovery of samples from the target formation
(coring) and testing. A ""dry hole"" is a well that for either geological or
mechanical reasons is judged by us to be incapable of producing oil or gas in
commercial quantities. If any well is not a ""dry hole"", a completion attempt
would be made at an estimated completion cost of $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 in 
order to set production casing, perforate, install the production tubing and 
wellhead and conduct extended tests of the well. We cannot assure you that any 
wells will be completed or produce oil or gas in commercial quantities. If the 
minimum of approximately $2,000,000 net proceeds are raised, we will attempt 
to complete the Ma'anit #1. If the maximum of approximately $12,400,000 net 
proceeds are raised, we may drill an offset appraisal well to the Ma'anit #1 
well or combination appraisal/deep exploration well offsetting the Ma'anit #1 
before attempting to complete the Ma'anit #1. 

Our engineers estimate that, in order to be commercially productive, any of the
wells we intend to drill to the approximate depth of 5,000 meters (16,400 feet),
based on industry standards, should be capable of producing at least 100 barrels
of oil per day or 600 thousand cubic feet of gas per day. Such production levels
will not pay out the cost of drilling the well, but only the costs of operating
the well on a current basis. In order to justify the costs of drilling of
additional wells, there should be the expectation that each additional well
would have initial production rates in excess of 1,000 barrels of oil per day or
six million cubic feet of gas per day, or some combination of the two, based
upon minimum oil prices of $25.00 per barrel and a minimum gas price of $3.00
per thousand cubic feet. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general and
administrative expenses and working capital. We intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment grade obligations or bank
certificates of deposit in both Israel and the United States until they are
used.

If the minimum amount is raised in this offering and assuming that the we are
able to raise an additional approximate amount of $1,250,000 in net available
funds from additional sources including currently open offerings to non-United
States residents under Regulation S promulgated by the SEC and the exercise of
warrants expiring on December 31, 2006 (which warrants are not required to be
exercised), the proceeds from this offering will satisfy our cash requirements
through June 2007, including the completion attempt of the Ma'anit #1. This
assumes that our officers would be willing, as they have done in the past, to
defer some of their salaries until more cash is available. Thereafter, it will
be necessary to raise additional funds for subsequent drilling. Out of the net
proceeds of $2,000,000 in this minimum case, $900,000 would be used for general
and administrative expenses (mostly salaries and professional fees), $900,000
would be available for the completion attempt on the first well and $200,000
would be set aside for contingencies on the completion attempt and exploration
activities. Following completion of the first well, we will install gas
separation facilities and storage tanks at an estimated cost of $600,000, which
will be paid from other funds (such as borrowings or the proceeds from exercises
of outstanding warrants expiring December 31, 2006) and not from the net
proceeds of this offering.

To the extent this offering is successful in raising the maximum funds, we
expect to have sufficient money to drill a new well to at least 17,000 feet,
complete the Ma'anit #1, and pay overhead through June 2007. Funds for the
completion of the new well, if successful, would have to come from other
sources, including the exercise of outstanding warrants that expire December 31,
2006 (which warrants are not required to be exercised). Out of the net proceeds
of $12,400,000, we would spend up to $600,000 to repay some of our outstanding
notes and accounts payable to shareholders and officers. For the period ending
June 30, 2007, we estimate that our general and administrative expenses will be 
$2,050,000, most of which would be spent on salaries, benefits and professional 
fees. With the maximum funds available, we estimate that we would spend $500,000 
on geological and geophysical studies in our license and permit areas (including 
approximately $100,000 annually to maintain our current license and permit). 
We would spend up to $8,800,000 to drill a second well (including $1,000,000 set 
aside for drilling contingencies), $300,000 to complete the Ma'anit #1, $50,000 
to set up the charitable trusts, and would reserve the remaining $100,000 for 
long lead time equipment required to complete the second well.

Our estimates for general and administrative costs below increase substantially
from the minimum to the maximum case. This occurs because the maximum case would
cause us to have a higher activity level, resulting in some higher expenses. Our
salaries and benefits also increase substantially in the maximum case because we
will be able to pay our officers and directors on a current basis, rather than
on the deferred basis required by the minimum case. We would also need a larger
staff for the increased activity. None of our experts, consultants, accountants,
or legal counsel has been hired on a contingent fee basis.

Our position is that the additional funds paid to our officers and directors in
the event of a maximum offering should not be considered compensation for their
selling our shares in the offering because their basic compensation rates remain
unchanged in either case. The only difference is that in the case of minimum
offering some of our officers would be working less than full time for less than
full salary. They would most likely also be deferring part of that salary as
well.

ZION OIL & GAS INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/zion-oil-gas-inc-95561-48302,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/zion-oil-gas-inc-95561-48302,424B3,11/21/2006,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4783053,"The net proceeds to us from the sale of a minimum of 350,000 and a maximum of
2,000,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $7.00 per share are
estimated to be approximately $2,000,000 and $12,400,000, respectively, after
deducting estimated placement agent commissions and offering expenses.

Some of our officers, directors, their affiliates and associates have loaned
(and/or have not been paid for services billed, or salaries earned) amounts
totaling approximately $1,730,000 as of August 31, 2006. Approximately $110,000
of this debt carries an annual interest rate of approximately 11%. The rest is
interest free. Substantially all the debt matures July 1, 2007. Of the
$1,730,000 total, approximately $890,000 was incurred through the year ended
December 31, 2005, and is deferred compensation of key employees (""2005 deferred
compensation""). If only the minimum of $2,450,000 is raised in this offering,
these persons have agreed to continue to defer receipt of their 2005 deferred
compensation at least through July 1, 2007, as provided in ""EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION-Deferral of Compensation"", page 51. If the maximum of $14,000,000
is raised in this offering, more than half of the accumulated deferred
compensation for the periods through December 31, 2005 will be paid out of the
proceeds received. If an amount between the minimum and the maximum is raised,
portions of the outstanding accounts payable will be exchanged for shares and/or
deferred and the remainder paid, based upon the amount raised and our other
financial conditions at the time of the termination of this offering.

We intend to use most of the net proceeds of this offering for geological and
geophysical studies and exploration and development drilling on our Israeli
license and permit areas. Our work program calls for the completion and testing
of an existing well (the Ma'anit #1) at an estimated cost of $800,000 to
$1,000,000 and the drilling of an appraisal/deep exploratory well in the license
area at an estimated ""dry hole"" cost of $7,400,000 to $9,100,000 to drill to a
total depth of approximately 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) to 5,500 meters (18,045
feet). We intend to evaluate the new well through a combination of electrical
wireline tool investigations, recovery of samples from the target formation
(coring) and testing. A ""dry hole"" is a well that for either geological or
mechanical reasons is judged by us to be incapable of producing oil or gas in
commercial quantities. If any well is not a ""dry hole"", a completion attempt
would be made at an estimated completion cost of $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 in 
order to set production casing, perforate, install the production tubing and 
wellhead and conduct extended tests of the well. We cannot assure you that any 
wells will be completed or produce oil or gas in commercial quantities. If the 
minimum of approximately $2,000,000 net proceeds are raised, we will attempt 
to complete the Ma'anit #1. If the maximum of approximately $12,400,000 net 
proceeds are raised, we may drill an offset appraisal well to the Ma'anit #1 
well or combination appraisal/deep exploration well offsetting the Ma'anit #1 
before attempting to complete the Ma'anit #1. 

Our engineers estimate that, in order to be commercially productive, any of the
wells we intend to drill to the approximate depth of 5,000 meters (16,400 feet),
based on industry standards, should be capable of producing at least 100 barrels
of oil per day or 600 thousand cubic feet of gas per day. Such production levels
will not pay out the cost of drilling the well, but only the costs of operating
the well on a current basis. In order to justify the costs of drilling of
additional wells, there should be the expectation that each additional well
would have initial production rates in excess of 1,000 barrels of oil per day or
six million cubic feet of gas per day, or some combination of the two, based
upon minimum oil prices of $25.00 per barrel and a minimum gas price of $3.00
per thousand cubic feet. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general and
administrative expenses and working capital. We intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment grade obligations or bank
certificates of deposit in both Israel and the United States until they are
used.

If the minimum amount is raised in this offering and assuming that the we are
able to raise an additional approximate amount of $1,250,000 in net available
funds from additional sources including currently open offerings to non-United
States residents under Regulation S promulgated by the SEC and the exercise of
warrants expiring on December 31, 2006 (which warrants are not required to be
exercised), the proceeds from this offering will satisfy our cash requirements
through June 2007, including the completion attempt of the Ma'anit #1. This
assumes that our officers would be willing, as they have done in the past, to
defer some of their salaries until more cash is available. Thereafter, it will
be necessary to raise additional funds for subsequent drilling. Out of the net
proceeds of $2,000,000 in this minimum case, $900,000 would be used for general
and administrative expenses (mostly salaries and professional fees), $900,000
would be available for the completion attempt on the first well and $200,000
would be set aside for contingencies on the completion attempt and exploration
activities. Following completion of the first well, we will install gas
separation facilities and storage tanks at an estimated cost of $600,000, which
will be paid from other funds (such as borrowings or the proceeds from exercises
of outstanding warrants expiring December 31, 2006) and not from the net
proceeds of this offering.

To the extent this offering is successful in raising the maximum funds, we
expect to have sufficient money to drill a new well to at least 17,000 feet,
complete the Ma'anit #1, and pay overhead through June 2007. Funds for the
completion of the new well, if successful, would have to come from other
sources, including the exercise of outstanding warrants that expire December 31,
2006 (which warrants are not required to be exercised). Out of the net proceeds
of $12,400,000, we would spend up to $600,000 to repay some of our outstanding
notes and accounts payable to shareholders and officers. For the period ending
June 30, 2007, we estimate that our general and administrative expenses will be 
$2,050,000, most of which would be spent on salaries, benefits and professional 
fees. With the maximum funds available, we estimate that we would spend $500,000 
on geological and geophysical studies in our license and permit areas (including 
approximately $100,000 annually to maintain our current license and permit). 
We would spend up to $8,800,000 to drill a second well (including $1,000,000 set 
aside for drilling contingencies), $300,000 to complete the Ma'anit #1, $50,000 
to set up the charitable trusts, and would reserve the remaining $100,000 for 
long lead time equipment required to complete the second well.

Our estimates for general and administrative costs below increase substantially
from the minimum to the maximum case. This occurs because the maximum case would
cause us to have a higher activity level, resulting in some higher expenses. Our
salaries and benefits also increase substantially in the maximum case because we
will be able to pay our officers and directors on a current basis, rather than
on the deferred basis required by the minimum case. We would also need a larger
staff for the increased activity. None of our experts, consultants, accountants,
or legal counsel has been hired on a contingent fee basis.

Our position is that the additional funds paid to our officers and directors in
the event of a maximum offering should not be considered compensation for their
selling our shares in the offering because their basic compensation rates remain
unchanged in either case. The only difference is that in the case of minimum
offering some of our officers would be working less than full time for less than
full salary. They would most likely also be deferring part of that salary as
well.

sale of 7,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions, the structuring fee payable to certain
of our underwriters and estimated offering expenses payable by us of
approximately $9.6 million. If the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional common units in full, we expect to receive net proceeds of
approximately $138.1 million. We will use the net proceeds from this offering to
repay approximately $35.0 million of outstanding debt of the general partner of
Hiland Partners, plus accrued interest, and to make a $84.9 million distribution
to the Contributing Parties, including Mr. Hamm and certain members of
management. The $35.0 million of outstanding debt was incurred to purchase
761,714 common units and 15,545 general partner units from Hiland Partners. This
debt bears interest at the lender's prime rate less 1.10% and matures upon the
earlier of the completion of this offering and October 31, 2007. The estimated
cash to be distributed to the Contributing Parties is expected to be distributed
as follows: (1) $48.0 million to Mr. Hamm, (2) $20.1 million to the Harold Hamm
DST Trust, (3) $13.4 million to the Harold Hamm HJ Trust, (4) $2.4 million to
Randy Moeder and (5) $1.0 million to Ken Maples. The relative percentages of the
cash to be distributed to the Contributing Parties was determined based on the
relative values of the common and subordinated units of Hiland Partners and the
interests in Hiland Partners GP, LLC that will be contributed to us by each of
the Contributing Parties. This value was determined based on the $44.57 average
closing market price of the common units of Hiland Partners for the three
trading days ended September 18, 2006 (which price was used to value the common
and subordinated units to be contributed to us) and our total market value based
on the $18.50 initial public offering price of our common units. We anticipate
that we will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters' option
to repurchase a number of common units from the Contributing Parties equal to
the number of common units issued upon the exercise of the underwriters' option
to purchase additional common units."
INVESCO DB G10 CURRENCY HARVEST FUND,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/invesco-db-g10-currency-harvest-fund-702524-49020,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/invesco-db-g10-currency-harvest-fund-702524-49020,424B3,10/4/2010,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7487021,"A substantial amount of proceeds of the offering of the Shares will be used by
the Fund, through the Master Fund, to engage in the trading of exchange-traded
futures on the Index Currencies with a view to tracking the Index over time,
less the expenses of the operations of the Fund and the Master Fund. The Master
Fund’s portfolio also will include United States Treasury securities for deposit
with the Master Fund’s Commodity Broker as margin and other high credit quality
short-term fixed income securities.

To the extent that the Master Fund trades in futures contracts on United States
exchanges, the assets deposited by the Master Fund with its Commodity Broker as
margin must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such
segregated funds may be invested only in a limited range of instruments—
principally U.S. government obligations.

To the extent, if any, that the Master Fund trades in futures on markets other
than regulated United States futures exchanges, funds deposited to margin
positions held on such exchanges are invested in bank deposits or in instruments
of a credit standing generally comparable to those authorized by the CFTC for
investment of “customer segregated funds,” although applicable CFTC rules
prohibit funds employed in trading on foreign exchanges from being deposited in
“customer segregated fund accounts.”

Although the percentages set forth below may vary substantially over time, as of
the date of this Prospectus, the Master Fund estimates:

(i) up to approximately 5% of the net asset value of the Master Fund will be
placed in segregated accounts in the name of the Master Fund with the Commodity
Broker (or another eligible financial institution, as applicable) in the form of
cash or United States Treasury bills to margin positions of all commodities
combined. Such funds will be segregated pursuant to CFTC rules;

(ii) approximately 95% of the net asset value of the Master Fund will be
maintained in segregated accounts in the name of the Master Fund in bank
deposits or United States Treasury and United States Government Agencies issues.

It is expected that the Master Fund will commit 5% or less of net assets to
margin its futures positions in the Index Currencies.

The Managing Owner, a registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading
advisor, will be responsible for the cash management activities of the Master
Fund, including investing in United States Treasury and United States Government
Agencies issues.

In addition, assets of the Master Fund not required to margin positions may be
maintained in United States bank accounts opened in the name of the Master Fund
and may be held in United States Treasury bills (or other securities approved by
the CFTC for investment of customer funds).

combined. Such funds will be segregated pursuant to CFTC rules;

(ii) approximately 95% of the net asset value of the Master Fund will be
maintained in segregated accounts in the name of the Master Fund in bank
deposits or United States Treasury and United States Government Agencies issues.

It is expected that the Master Fund will commit 5% or less of net assets to
margin its futures positions in the Index Currencies.

The Managing Owner, a registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading
advisor, will be responsible for the cash management activities of the Master
Fund, including investing in United States Treasury and United States Government
Agencies issues.

In addition, assets of the Master Fund not required to margin positions may be
maintained in United States bank accounts opened in the name of the Master Fund
and may be held in United States Treasury bills (or other securities approved by
the CFTC for investment of customer funds).

The Master Fund receives 100% of the interest income earned on its fixed income
assets."

the Fund, through the Master Fund, to engage in the trading of exchange-traded
futures on the Index Currencies with a view to tracking the Index over time,
less the expenses of the operations of the Fund and the Master Fund. The Master
Fund’s portfolio also will include United States Treasury securities for deposit
with the Master Fund’s Commodity Broker as margin and other high credit quality
short-term fixed income securities.

To the extent that the Master Fund trades in futures contracts on United States
exchanges, the assets deposited by the Master Fund with its Commodity Broker as
margin must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such
segregated funds may be invested only in a limited range of instruments—
principally U.S. government obligations.

To the extent, if any, that the Master Fund trades in futures on markets other
than regulated United States futures exchanges, funds deposited to margin
positions held on such exchanges are invested in bank deposits or in instruments
of a credit standing generally comparable to those authorized by the CFTC for
investment of “customer segregated funds,” although applicable CFTC rules
prohibit funds employed in trading on foreign exchanges from being deposited in
“customer segregated fund accounts.”

Although the percentages set forth below may vary substantially over time, as of
the date of this Prospectus, the Master Fund estimates:

(i) up to approximately 5% of the net asset value of the Master Fund will be
placed in segregated accounts in the name of the Master Fund with the Commodity
Broker (or another eligible financial institution, as applicable) in the form of
cash or United States Treasury bills to margin positions of all commodities
combined. Such funds will be segregated pursuant to CFTC rules;

      Amounts allocated to general and administrative expenses will be used for
office supplies, telephone, legal and accounting expenses, and other general
corporate expenses.

      The total estimated expenses of this offering are $45,000. As of April 30,
2006 Security Devices had paid substantially all of these expenses with cash
which it received with cash on hand and from the private sale of its common
stock.

      If less than $80,000 is raised in this offering the offering proceeds will
be used in the following priority:

     o    General and administrative expenses

approximations and do not represent a firm commitment by Security Devices. To
the extent that the proposed expenditures are insufficient for the purposes
indicated, supplemental amounts required may be drawn from other categories of
estimated expenditures, if available. Conversely, any amounts not expended as
proposed will be used for general working capital.  

      As of the date of this prospectus Security Devices had borrowed $8,029
from its officers and directors. None of the proceeds from this offering will be
used to repay these loans.

      Security Devices anticipates that its capital requirements for the twelve
months following the development of the date of this prospectus will be
approximately $843,000, which amount includes $743,000 for the Long Range WERS.
Security Devices' anticipated research and development expenditures may increase
or decrease depending on the extent of any difficulties which may be encountered
in developing the Long Range WERS.

      After the development of the Long Range WERS has been completed, Security
Devices plans to develop a Short Range version of WERS. However, since the
development of the Long Range WERS is not complete, Security Devices does not
know the time or cost involved in developing the Short Range WERS. Amounts not
used for the development of the Long Range WERS will be used for the development
of the Short Range WERS.

        Even if all shares Security Devices is offering are sold, its future
operations will be dependent upon its ability to obtain additional capital
until, if ever, Security Devices can become profitable. As of the date of this

provide it with any additional capital and there can be no assurance that
additional funds may be obtained in the future.

million or approximately US$117.3 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, obtain additional capital and repay the
outstanding indebtedness under our loan agreements and corporate facility with
commercial banks. The following table sets forth a summary of our outstanding
indebtedness as of July 31, 2006:

We incurred the RMB10 million short-term loan in 2006 to repay part of our
existing loans and finance the construction of our school in Yangzhou.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

    •   approximately US$18.5 million to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness;

    •   up to US$20 million to expand our network of schools and learning centers  
        and improve our existing facilities; and                                   

    •   the balance to fund working capital and for other general corporate        
        purposes, which may include strategic acquisitions of businesses that could
        complement our existing capabilities and business.

cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above.
For a discussion of our strategies and business plan. We do not currently have 
any agreements or understandings to make any material acquisitions of, or 
investments in, other businesses. To the extent that the net proceeds we 
receive from this offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, 
we intend to invest our net proceeds in interest bearing bank deposits that 
may be withdrawn upon demand.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we
are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to other entities
only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiaries and affiliated entities or make additional capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or
working capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all.  

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus."

approximately US$60.1 million, or approximately US$72.8 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of
ADSs by the selling shareholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

    •   approximately US$35.0 million to fund the expansion of our hotel chain and 
        the improvement of existing hotel properties;                              

    •   approximately US$7.5 million to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness  
        to BTG; and                                                                

    •   the balance to fund working capital and for other general corporate        
        purposes, which may include strategic acquisitions of complementary        
        businesses, although we are not currently negotiating any such transaction.

The following table sets forth a summary of our outstanding indebtedness to BTG
as of September 30, 2006, which we intend to repay using part of the proceeds we
will receive from this offering:

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we
are permitted, under PRC regulations, to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries
only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction of
applicable government registrations and approval requirements, we may extend
inter-company loans or make additional capital contributions to our PRC
subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and allocate the net
proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business conditions.
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities."

approximately $46.2 million, based on the initial public offering price of
$11.50 per share, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’
overallotment option is exercised in full, we estimate our net proceeds will be
approximately $53.4 million.

We expect to use the majority of the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

      •    approximately $20.7 million to complete the current phase II clinical   
           trials of elvucitabine and to further its clinical development into     
           phase III clinical trials, including approximately $3.7 million of      
           external costs related to current phase II clinical trials.             

      •    approximately $3.2 million to support our share of ACH-806 development  
           costs pursuant to our collaboration with Gilead Sciences through the    
           proof-of-concept stage;                                                 

      •    approximately $1.5 million to complete the preclinical development of   
           ACH-702, followed by approximately $11.5 million to fund further        
           clinical development of ACH-702; and                                    

      •    approximately $9.3 million to support research activities over the next 
           12 months on other HIV, chronic hepatitis C and antibacterial drug      
           candidates.                                                             

This foregoing use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering, the progress of our
clinical trials and research and development efforts and our ability to enter
into strategic collaborations, as well as the amount of cash used in our
operations. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the proceeds of this offering. We do not expect the net proceeds
from this offering and our other available funds to be sufficient to fund the
completion of the development of any of our drug candidates, and we expect that
we will need to raise additional funds prior to being able to market any drugs.
In particular, to complete two phase III clinical trials for elvucitabine, we
believe we may need to raise at least an additional $40.0 million.

We reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of certain
contingencies such as the results of our drug discovery and development
activities, competitive developments, opportunities to acquire products,
technologies or businesses and other factors.

Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with interest
thereon and our existing cash and cash equivalents, as supplemented by research
funding pursuant to our collaboration with Gilead Sciences, will be sufficient
to meet our projected operating requirements into the third quarter of 2008. We
will need to raise substantial additional funds before we can expect to
commercialize any drug candidate. We expect to satisfy our future cash needs
through the sale of equity securities, debt financings, corporate collaborations
and licensing agreements and grant funding, as well as through interest income
earned on cash balances."

$48.5 million from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this
offering, based on the initial public offering price of $9.00 per share and
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering costs payable by us.

      The principal purposes for this offering are to fund clinical trials and
other research and development activities, including with respect to our two
product candidates, to fund our working capital, to make capital expenditures,
for other general corporate purposes, to create a public market for our common
stock, to increase our ability to access the capital markets in the future and
to provide liquidity for our existing stockholders.

      We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

     •     approximately $43.1 million to fund clinical trials for IV APAP and  
           Omigard and other research and development activities;               
    
     •     approximately $3.0 million to fund capital expenditures, primarily   
           including equipment associated with the manufacturing of IV APAP; and
    
     •     the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate    
           purposes.                                                            

      We anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash and cash equivalents, will allow us to complete the clinical
trials necessary to support NDA filings for IV APAP and Omigard.

      We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or
invest in complementary businesses or products. However, we have no current
understandings, commitments or agreements to do so.

      The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress in, and costs of, our clinical trials and other
product development programs. We therefore cannot estimate the amount of net
proceeds to be used for all of the purposes described above. We may find it
necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will
have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

      Private Investors for approximately $173.1 million of capital expenditures  
      incurred prior to this offering related to the assets to be contributed to

units issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ option, at a price per common
unit equal to the proceeds per common unit before expenses but after
underwriting discounts and fees, and to reimburse Eagle Rock Energy Holdings,
L.P. and the Private Investors for capital expenditures incurred indirectly by
them."

these funds to repay in full the $152.0 million second lien term loan facility
under our 2006 Credit Facility (including accrued and unpaid interest) incurred
in connection with the Acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.
Affiliates of two of the underwriters, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Wachovia Capital
Markets, LLC, are lenders under the second lien term loan facility. As a result,
affiliates of the underwriters may receive more than 10% of the entire net
proceeds of this offering. An affiliate of Fortress that acquired a portion of
the second lien term loans in an arms’ length secondary market transaction will
also receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering as a result of the
repayment of the second lien term loan facility. As of June 30, 2006, the
interest rate applicable to the second lien term loan facility was 6.77%. The
second lien term loan facility matures on June 6, 2014. This loan can be prepaid
without penalty.

(1)  º Excludes offering costs totaling approximately $7.1 million that have been
     paid by us as of June 30, 2006 with funds advanced by the entities being
     acquired in the formation transactions.

(2)  º We currently estimate cash on hand at closing to be approximately
     $147.7 million after our predecessor entities have made the pre-closing
     property distributions of approximately $24.0 million and the pre-closing
     operating company distributions of approximately $0.5 million.

    If the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, we will use
cash in the amount of the additional gross proceeds to increase the cash
payments to the prior investors in the formation transactions and thereby to
correspondingly reduce the equity consideration payable to such investors.

    As set forth in the table above, in connection with the financing
transactions, we expect to repay approximately $151.4 million of outstanding
indebtedness, including accrued interest, with a weighted average interest rate
of 4.9% and a weighted average maturity of 2.0 years as of June 30, 2006.

    The aggregate historical net tangible book value of the assets to be
acquired by us in the formation transactions was approximately $478.4 million as
of June 30, 2006. We will assume or discharge $2.54 billion in indebtedness and
preferred equity, and we will pay consideration in the formation transactions
with an aggregate value of $3.75 billion (consisting of cash, shares of our
common stock and operating partnership units) in exchange for these assets. The
initial public offering price of our common stock does not necessarily bear any
relationship to the book value or the fair market value of these assets, but
instead was determined in consultation with the underwriters. Among the factors
that were considered in determining that initial public offering price are the
history and prospects for the industry in which we compete, our financial
information, the ability of our management and our business potential and
earning prospects, the prevailing securities markets at the time of this
offering, and the recent market prices of, and the demand for, publicly traded
shares of generally comparable companies. We have not obtained any third-party

(1)  º Includes underwriters' deferred discount of 4% of gross proceeds

(2)  º $7.88 per unit

(3)  º Funds held in the trust account are not available to holders of private
     placement securities upon our liquidation and dissolution

    Of the net proceeds of this offering, $81,050,000 or $93,605,000 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, plus $4,000,000 from
the private placement, (accordingly, an aggregate of $85,050,000 or $97,605,000,
respectively) will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. Additionally, $3,600,000, or $4,140,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount will be deposited into such trust account. The funds held
in the trust account will be invested only in United States ""government
securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our dissolution
and liquidation. If we are required to dissolve, we anticipate we will pay the
costs of dissolution and liquidation, which we currently estimate to be
approximately $50,000 to $75,000, from our remaining assets outside of the trust
account. This amount includes all costs and expenses relating to filing our
certificate of dissolution in the State of Delaware, the winding up of our
company and the costs of a proxy statement and meeting relating to the approval
by our stockholders of our dissolution and plan for the distribution of our
assets. While we believe there should be sufficient funds available for the
proceeds not held in the trust account to fund the $50,000 to $75,000 of
expenses, David C. McCourt has agreed to pay the costs of dissolution and
liquidation in the event our remaining assets outside the trust are insufficient
to pay those costs, excluding any special, indirect or consequential costs or
expenses, such as litigation pertaining to our dissolution and liquidation.
While we will seek waivers from all target acquisitions, vendors and service
providers to claims to amounts in the trust account, we cannot guarantee that we
will be able to obtain any such waiver or that any such waiver will be held
valid and enforceable. Mr. McCourt has agreed that he will be personally liable
to cover claims made by such third parties, but only if, and to the extent, the
claims reduce the amounts in the trust account available for payment to our
stockholders in the event of a liquidation and the claims are made by a vendor
for services rendered, or products sold, to us or by a prospective target
business. However, Mr. McCourt will not have any personal liability as to any
claimed amounts owed to a third party who executed a waiver, or as to any claims
under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target acquisition with which we complete a business combination
(excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the
underwriters' discount). Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business will be used to finance our operations, which may include
the target business(es) we acquire in connection with the business combination,
to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board
of directors at that time.

    The payment to Capital of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for certain
administrative services, including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. David C. McCourt is the Chairman and CEO of Capital and, as a result,
will benefit from the transaction with Capital. However, this arrangement is
solely for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. McCourt compensation
in lieu of a salary.

    Mr. McCourt has advanced a total of $218,000 in exchange for a promissory
note from us. The promissory note is payable, without interest, upon the earlier
of (i) the consummation of the offering and (ii) July 17, 2007.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event,
the proceeds released to us from the trust account as well as any other net
proceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations, which may include
the operations of target business(es) that we acquire in the business
combination, to effect other acquisitions, for working capital, or for other
corporate purposes, as determined by our board of directors at that time.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, having a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of
these net proceeds during this period that is not otherwise returned to public
stockholders who vote against a business combination will be used to defray our
general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation
of a business combination, we will pay Capital the administrative services fee
described above. Other than this $10,000 per month fee, we will not pay any
compensation of any kind (including finders, consulting or other similar fees)
to any of our existing officers, directors or existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services that they render in order to
effectuate, or in connection with the consummation of the business combination.
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement, subject to board approval,
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target acquisitions, performing
business due diligence on suitable target acquisitions and business
combinations, as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target acquisitions to examine their operations. In
addition, Mr. McCourt may, in his sole discretion, transfer our securities held
by him to our existing officers and directors who participate in the due
diligence, structuring and negotiating of a business combination.

    We intend to use the funds not held in the trust account for due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business
combination, as well as a possible down payment, lock-up or ""no-shop"" provision,
or, if necessary, to bear the costs of dissolution and liquidation if in the
event we are unable to effect a business combination within 18 months after the
consummation of this offering (or within 24 months from the consummation of this
offering if a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement
has been executed within 18 months after the consummation of this offering and
the business combination has not yet been consummated within the 18-month
period). While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down
payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we
paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount
that would be used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision would be
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and
the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of these funds
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, potential target acquisitions. In addition to the use of funds
described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to
consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition. We believe
that the funds not held in the trust account will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses.

    We will have approximately $2,100,000 outside the trust account. Of this
amount, we estimate we will use $750,000 for legal, accounting and other
expenses attendant to the due diligence investigation, structuring and
negotiating of a business combination, $240,000 for the administrative fee
payable to Capital, $100,000 for legal and accounting fees relating to our SEC
reporting obligations and $1,010,000 for general working capital that can be
used for fairness opinions in connection with our acquisition plans, director
and officer liability insurance premiums, and other miscellaneous expenses and
reserves. We do not believe that we will need to raise additional funds
following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating
our business. However, we may need to raise additional funds through a private
offering of debt or equity securities if funds are required to consummate a
business combination that is presented to us, although we have not entered into
any such arrangements and have no current intention of doing so.

    A public stockholder (but not our existing stockholders with respect to any
shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering) will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned
on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the event of our
dissolution and liquidation or if that public stockholder (but not our existing
stockholders with respect to any shares of our common stock owned by them
immediately prior to this offering) converts such shares into cash in connection
with a business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which
we consummate. An existing stockholder who acquires shares in or after this
offering, however, would be a public stockholder with respect to these shares
and retains the right to receive funds from the trust account upon our
dissolution and liquidation and to exercise conversion rights attributable to
such shares. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust account
attributable to the underwriters' discount held in the trust account (subject to
a $0.32 per share reduction with respect to public stockholders who vote against
our initial business combination and exercise their conversion rights). In the
event that we are unable to consummate a business combination and the trustee is
forced to dissolve and liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed
that: (i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and any
accrued interest thereon; and (ii) the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public
stockholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

will receive from the sale of common stock in this offering will be
approximately $98.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions
and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters’ overallotment option is
exercised in full, our net proceeds will be approximately $113.0 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:
 
      †   to redeem $50.0 million of our 10 5/8% senior notes due 2013, plus the   
          payment of accrued interest and premium thereon (approximately $5.5      
          million as of July 2, 2006);                                             

      †   to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility  
          (approximately $11.4 million as of July 2, 2006); and                    

      †   for general corporate purposes, including growth capital.

The senior notes accrue interest at a rate of 10 5/8% and mature on December 15,
2013. They were issued in order to finance a portion of the consideration needed
for the December 2005 transactions. Interest under our revolving credit facility
accrues at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin. As of July 2, 2006, the interest
rate was 9.0%. The revolving credit facility terminates on December 20, 2010."

approximately $33.0 million, based on the initial public offering price of $7.00
per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ overallotment
option is exercised in full, we estimate the net proceeds payable to us will be
approximately $38.4 million.

We currently estimate that of the net proceeds we receive from this offering we
will spend approximately $4.37 million to repay outstanding indebtedness to
Brown Brothers. This includes the following amounts outstanding as of September
30, 2006:

     †   approximately $0.77 million in aggregate principal and interest under a   
         first term loan with Brown Brothers;                                      

     †   approximately $2.50 million in aggregate principal and interest under a   
         second term loan with Brown Brothers; and                                 

     †   approximately $1.10 million in aggregate principal and interest under our 
         revolving line of credit with Brown Brothers.                             

Our first term loan with Brown Brothers currently bears interest at 8.75% per
annum, matures on April 11, 2008, and may be prepaid in whole or in part without
penalty. Our second term loan with Brown Brothers currently bears interest at
10.00% per annum, matures on September 30, 2008 and must be repaid in full with
the proceeds of this offering. We entered into our second term loan in September
2006, and used the proceeds to pay costs associated with this offering and, to a
lesser degree, for working capital purposes.

Our revolving line of credit currently bears interest at 8.25% per annum and
matures upon the earlier of demand and acceleration by Brown Brothers following
the occurrence of an event of default or February 6, 2008. The revolving line of
credit may be prepaid in whole or in part without penalty. We used the proceeds
we received from this revolving line of credit during the past year to pay $0.2
million on June 2, 2006 in partial consideration of our acquisition of the
AnastoClip product line and related operations from Tyco Healthcare Group L.P.
and $0.2 million on May 26, 2006 in partial consideration of our acquisition of
certain business assets and operations and assumed liabilities of Credent
Limited and Credent Vascular Technologies Limited, as further described in our
consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. The
remainder of these proceeds were used primarily to pay costs associated with
this offering and, to a lesser degree, for working capital purposes.

In addition, we currently estimate we will use the net proceeds we receive from
this offering to pay a fee payable upon completion of this offering to Brown
Brothers. This fee is equal to 7.5 basis points, or 0.075%, of the pre-public
offering valuation of LeMaitre Vascular at the execution of the public offering.
Based on the initial public offering price of $7.00 per share, we estimate that
this fee will equal approximately $51,300. 

We intend to use the remainder of our net proceeds to finance our working
capital needs, including the hiring of additional sales personnel, the funding
of our clinical studies and the expansion of our manufacturing and research and
development capabilities, and for general corporate purposes. We may also use a
portion of our net proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies or
businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete
any such transaction and are not involved in negotiations to do so.

This expected use of the net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including
cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business. We will
retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of our net proceeds. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds from this offering
primarily in investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

from this offering, or $72.6 million if the underwriters exercise in full their
option to purchase up to 945,000 additional shares of our common stock from us,
after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of
our common stock by the selling stockholders.

    We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of
the outstanding indebtedness under our senior credit facility. As of June 30,
2006, we had $99.8 million of term loan indebtedness outstanding under our
senior credit facility and $3.8 million of revolving indebtedness outstanding
under our senior credit facility. The term loan indebtedness was incurred to
finance the acquisition of Morgan, to pay transaction expenses incurred in
connection with the acquisition and to refinance our previously outstanding
indebtedness.

    Our senior credit facility consists of a $100.0 million term loan facility
that matures on January 31, 2012, and a $50.0 million revolving credit facility
that matures on January 31, 2011. Indebtedness under our senior credit facility
bears interest at a variable rate based upon LIBOR or a prime rate, at our
option. At June 30, 2006, the weighted average interest rate on indebtedness
outstanding under our senior credit facility and to be repaid with the proceeds
of this offering was 7.42%."

of 4,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering, based upon the initial
public offering price of $13.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will
also receive $10.4 million from the sale of 800,000 shares of common stock at
the initial public offering price in the concurrent private placement to Wyeth.
If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate
that our net proceeds will be approximately $63.8 million.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for
our common stock, to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets
and to obtain additional capital. We will retain broad discretion in the
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. We currently intend to use the
net proceeds of this offering together with the proceeds from the sale of our
common stock to Wyeth for the following purposes and in the following amounts:

   •   approximately $36.7 million will be used for the development and          
       commercialization of our research pipeline,                               
  
   •   approximately $14.1 million will be used for building infrastructure, such
       as small scale manufacturing capabilities, to support our business plan,  
       and                                                                       
  
   •   approximately $5.7 million will be used for general corporate purposes,   
       including working capital.                                                

    In addition, we may choose to repay all or part of our credit facility with
Comerica Bank. The credit facility has either a fixed interest rate or variable
interest rate, which will be determined at the time of each advance from the
facility. The credit facility has a maturity date of September 12, 2012. We will
use the proceeds of this loan for tenant improvements and laboratory equipment.
We have drawn $2.9 million of the loan as of September 30, 2006.

    Notwithstanding the estimates above, the amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the status of our
research and development efforts, the timing and success of preclinical testing,
the timing and success of any clinical trials we may commence in the future, the
timing of regulatory submissions, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this
offering, the amount of cash generated by our operations, the amount of
competition we face and our success in obtaining any required licenses and
entering into collaboration arrangements. We may also use a portion of the
proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies,
products or assets that complement our business. However, we have no present
understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any potential
acquisitions or investments.

    We do not expect our existing capital resources and the net proceeds from
this offering and the concurrent private placement to Wyeth to be sufficient to
enable us to fund the completion of the development of any of our product
candidates. We believe that our existing capital resources and the net proceeds
from this offering and the concurrent private placement to Wyeth will be
sufficient to enable us to complete our ongoing clinical trials and to maintain
currently planned operations for the next 24 months, including:

   •   completion of a Phase IIb clinical trial for TRU-015 in rheumatoid        
       arthritis that we initiated in September 2006,                            
  
   •   initiation and completion of a proof-of-concept study of TRU-015 for the  
       treatment of SLE, and                                                     
  
   •   filing of an IND for TRU-016 in the second half of 2007.                  

    However, the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain
and subject to risk and will change depending upon the clinical indications
targeted, the development strategy pursued and the results of earlier clinical
trials.

    Until we use the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the
funds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. We cannot
predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return."

    We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:
   •  approximately $68.3 million to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness    
      under our senior notes issued in August 2005, which we refer to as the      
      senior notes. The senior notes bear interest at a rate per annum, reset

    Following specific applications of the net proceeds, we plan to invest any

    We will also repurchase on the closing date of this offering 326,949 shares

net proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option).

      In addition, we will use net proceeds of approximately $123.9 million (net

The indebtedness we will assume from Universal Compression Holdings bears
interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.50% and matures in 2012.

million after deducting the underwriters’ discount and the estimated expenses
related to this offering. These estimates are based on an initial public
offering price of $11.00 per share. 

We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering in the following manner: 

$48.0  million to repay the note we issued to LAIF, a related company, in
connection with our purchase of its 66.67% interest in UP Offshore; 

$11.5  million to repay the notes we issued to Crosstrees Maritime Inc. and
Crosstrade Maritime Inc., related companies, in connection with our purchase of
Ravenscroft and related assets; 

$26.7 million to repay some of our variable interest rate indebtedness owed to
IFC and certain of our other lenders; 

$4.3  million to redeem UP Offshore’s redeemable preferred shares issued to
IFC; 

$6.2  million to discharge the obligations to IFC resulting from our purchase of
its interest in our River Business; 

$20.0 million to be held as working capital to fund a portion of the balance of
the construction costs of the two PSVs being built in Brazil; and 
the remainder, or approximately $8.7 million, for general corporate purposes. 

The purchase price for the interest in UP Offshore was $48.0  million, based on
negotiations, and the purchase price for Ravenscroft was $11.5 million, based on
negotiations. 

The indebtedness we will repay with the proceeds of this offering carry the
following terms and principal amounts outstanding. 

The $48.0 million note we issued to LAIF is non-interest bearing and matures on
the earlier of (1) the closing of this offering and (2) October 31, 2006. 

The $11.5  million notes we issued to Crosstrees Maritime Inc. and Crosstrade
Maritime Inc. are non-interest bearing and mature on the earlier of (1) the
closing of this offering and (2) October 31, 2006. 

The variable interest rate indebtedness we are repaying includes the following: 

$11.8 million owed to IFC, which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR + 3.75% and
matures in December 2011; 

$3.5 million owed to IFC, which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR + 3.5% and
matures in December 2009;

matures in December 2009;

common stock in this offering of approximately $1.1 billion, or $1.2 billion if
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based on the
initial public offering price of $15 per share, and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. 

Old SAIC declared a special dividend to holders of record of Old SAIC class A
and class B common stock as of October 12, 2006. The dividend is estimated to be
$2.45 billion in the aggregate, payable following completion of the offering.
The special dividend will exceed the net proceeds from this offering by
approximately $1.4 billion. Following the completion of this offering, we will
have, on a consolidated basis, cash of approximately $3.5 billion to pay the
special dividend. Cash remaining after the special dividend payment and
borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be used for general corporate
purposes, including working capital, capital spending, internal growth
initiatives and possible investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary
businesses, services or technologies. The payment of the special dividend is
conditioned upon the completion of this offering.  

The principal purpose of this offering is to better enable us to use our cash
and cash flows generated from operations to fund internal growth and growth
through acquisitions, as well as to provide us with publicly traded stock that
can be used for future acquisitions. Creating a public market for our common
stock will ultimately eliminate our use of cash to provide liquidity to our
stockholders by repurchasing their shares in the limited market or in other
transactions."

(1)Of this amount, 6% is payable at closing and 1% is payable only upon
consummation of a business combination. If the over-allotment is exercised,
5.6739% is payable at closing and 1.3261% is payable only upon consummation of a
business combination.

(2)For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are reflected as the
amount payable to the underwriter upon consummation of the offering. An
additional $240,000, or $366,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full, all of which will be deposited in trust following the consummation of the
offering, is payable to the underwriter only if and when we consummate a
business combination.

$115,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the NASD
filing fee, a portion of the non-accountable expense allowance and a portion of
the legal fees have been paid from the funds that were lent to us by FCF. These
loans will be repaid, without interest, out of the proceeds of this offering
upon consummation of this offering.

(4)As indicated above, the underwriting discounts are reflected as the amount
payable to the underwriter upon consummation of the offering. An additional
$366,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, all of which will be
deposited in trust following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the
underwriter only if and when we consummate a business combination.

$21,159,996 of the net proceeds we receive from this offering (which includes
$240,000 of underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the underwriter in
this offering which is being deferred by it until we consummate a business
combination), or $24,633,996 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
plus the additional $2,000,004 we will receive from the sale of Insider Units,
totaling $23,160,000 (or $26,634,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised
in full), will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers Inc. maintained
by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States “government
securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination.

The payment to Fortissimo Capital Management Ltd. (“FCM”), of a monthly fee of
$7,500 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. FCM also provides management services to and
is affiliated with FCF. This arrangement is solely for our benefit and is not
intended to provide any of our officers or directors compensation in lieu of
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in Israel, that
the fee charged by FCM is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a
business combination or the distribution of the trust fund to our public
stockholders upon our liquidation. Other than the $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting
or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors,
stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination
(regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and
business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or
similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.
Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in
trust and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant
to the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business
combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses” and “Working
capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, taxes and reserves.”
Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,
we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

$780,004 of the proceeds from the offering and from the sale of Insider Units,
after payment of the expenses of the offering, will not be placed in trust and
will be available for our use. We intend to use these funds to cover the payment
of administrative fees to FCM ($180,000), due diligence of prospective target
businesses ($100,000), legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to
negotiating the business combination ($200,000), legal and accounting fees
relating to SEC reporting obligations ($100,000), and the balance for director
and officer liability insurance premiums and as a reserve in the event due
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that these funds will be
sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use
a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to
assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of
the funds not being placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop”
provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses
from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more
favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If
we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms
of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at 
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or 
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue 
searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target 
businesses. Furthermore, although not our current intention, it is theoretically 
possible that we would make such a large down-payment or no-shop payment as to 
not have sufficient funds to consummate a business combination with the target. 
Were this to occur, there would be an increase in the excess expenses that 
would be covered by insider advances.

The allocation of net proceeds not held in trust represents our best estimate of
the intended uses of these funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be
inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described
categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target business. Such
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing,
research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be
used to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred
prior to the completion of our business combination if the funds available to us
outside of the trust fund were insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of dissolution from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, FCF has agreed to advance us the funds necessary
to complete such dissolution (currently anticipated to be no more than
approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, FCF has advanced to us a total of $115,000,
which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in
the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and legal and
audit fees and expenses. These loans are payable without interest. Of the total
amount, $55,000 is due upon the earlier to occur of December 28, 2006 and the
consummation of this offering, and $60,000 is due upon the earlier to occur of
January 29, 2007 and the consummation of this offering. These loans will be
repaid out of the proceeds of this offering upon consummation of this offering.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States “government
securities” so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net
proceeds during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder (but not our
initial stockholders) were to seek to convert such shares into cash in
connection with a business combination which the public stockholder voted
against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."
ACME PACKET INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/acme-packet-inc-176700-50162,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/acme-packet-inc-176700-50162,424B4,10/13/2006,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4702713,"We estimate that our net proceeds from our sale of 8,000,000 shares of
common stock in this offering will be approximately $68.5 million, at the
initial public offering price of $9.50 per share, and after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. At the
public offering price of $9.50 per share, the selling stockholders will receive
$30.7 million from their sale of our common stock in this offering, after
deducting the underwriting discount. If the underwriters exercise their option
to purchase additional shares, we estimate that we will receive an additional
$15.2 million in net proceeds at the initial public offering price of $9.50 per
share.

    We intend to use our net proceeds of this offering for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, which may include financing our growth
(including payment of increased levels of expenditures), developing new
products, and funding capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments. We
have not yet determined with any certainty the manner in which we will allocate
these net proceeds. Management will retain broad discretion in the allocation
and use of our net proceeds of this offering. The amounts and timing of these
expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of
cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments,
and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. For example, if we were to
expand our operations more rapidly than anticipated by our current plans, a
greater portion of the proceeds would likely be used for the construction and
expansion of facilities, working capital and other capital expenditures.
Alternatively, if we were to engage in an acquisition that contained a
significant cash component, some or all of the proceeds might be used for that
purpose.

    Although we may use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or
investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our
business, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter
into any acquisitions or make any investments. We cannot assure you that we will
make any acquisitions or investments in the future.

    Pending specific utilization of the net proceeds as described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term investment grade
and U.S. government securities."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $61.0 million at the initial
public offering price of $14.00 per share and after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
will be $70.8 million.

The principal reasons for this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to public equity markets. We currently have no specific plans for the use of the
net proceeds of this offering. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds
we receive from this offering, including any net proceeds we receive from the
exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including the funding of our marketing
activities and the costs of operating as a public company, as well as further
investment in the development of our proprietary technologies. We have not
allocated any specific portion of the net proceeds to any particular purpose,
and our management will have the discretion to allocate the proceeds as it
determines. We may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of
businesses, products and technologies that we believe are complementary to our
own, although we have no agreements or understandings with respect to any
acquisition at this time.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade
securities."

after deducting the underwriting discount and the estimated expenses payable 
by us related to this offering. The net proceeds from this offering are 
expected to be used to repay outstanding indebtedness of $99.1 million under 
our credit facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland and to repay outstanding 
indebtedness of $99.1 million under our credit facility with Aegean Baltic 
Bank. Our current Royal Bank of Scotland and Aegean Baltic Bank credit 
facilities have maturity dates of October 15, 2013 and June 30, 2013, 
respectively, and bear interest at rates of LIBOR plus 0.8% and LIBOR plus 
0.825%, respectively. These borrowings were used to repay $311.0 million of 
existing indebtedness in 2005 incurred under prior credit facilities with 
various lenders in order to finance the acquisition of vessels in our current 
fleet, and to provide working capital. 

Assuming, however, that prior to the closing of this offering we enter into 
new credit facilities, one with The Royal Bank of Scotland and one with Aegean 
Baltic Bank S.A. and HSH Nordbank AG, we will refinance the outstanding 
indebtedness under our existing credit facilities with The Royal Bank of 
Scotland and Aegean Baltic Bank S.A. with borrowings under these new credit 
facilities. In that case, we would apply the net proceeds of this offering to 
repay $99.1 million of indebtedness incurred under the new Royal Bank of 
Scotland credit facility and $99.1 million of indebtedness under the new Aegean 
Baltic-HSH Nordbank credit facility. The new Royal Bank of Scotland and the 
new Aegean Baltic-HSH Nordbank credit facilities will each have an interest 
rate of LIBOR plus 0.75%."

deducting the underwriting discount of $7.8 million and offering expenses of
approximately $3.5 million, to repay certain indebtedness described below and to
make a distribution of $63.2 million to Provident and BreitBurn Corporation.

    In connection with this offering and the contribution of the Partnership
Properties to us, we will assume approximately $36.5 million in outstanding
indebtedness under BreitBurn Energy's existing credit facility and repay this
indebtedness with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. The interest
rate under BreitBurn Energy's existing credit facility is determined with
reference to the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate and LIBOR. At June 30, 2006,
the interest rate on the Prime Rate-based portion of the facility was 8.75% and
the interest rate on the LIBOR-based portion of the facility was 6.85%. The
maturity date of the facility is July 11, 2009.

    We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters' option
to purchase additional common units to redeem pro rata the number of common
units from Provident and BreitBurn Corporation equal to the number of common
units issued upon the exercise of the underwriters' option.

    An affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an underwriter for this
offering, is a lender under BreitBurn Energy's credit facility, which will be
repaid with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering, and will be a
lender under our new credit facility."

------
(1) As of the date hereof, approximately $70,000 of the offering expenses,       
    including the SEC registration fee, the NASD filing fee and a portion of the 
    non-accountable expense allowance and legal and audit fees, have been paid   
    from the funds we received from Mr. Rosenfeld described below. These funds   
    will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust
    upon consummation of this offering.                                          

(2) For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are reflected as the
    amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of the offering. An     
    additional $360,000, or $414,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in
    full, all of which will be deposited in trust following the consummation of  
    the offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a
    business combination.                                                        

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Eric S. Rosenfeld, our
chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president, Messrs. Leonard B.
Schlemm, Jon Bauer and Colin D. Watson, each a member of our board of directors,
and Gotham Capital V, an entity controlled by Joel Greenblatt, our special
advisor, have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate
purchase price of $1,250,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.
We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the
insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be
placed in the trust fund described below.

$32,900,000, or $38,028,250 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,250,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Lehman
Brothers, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York,
New York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting
discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The
underwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we
consummate a business combination and have waived their right to receive such
payment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business
combination. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to $200,000 of
interest income that may be released to us following the one year anniversary of
the date of this prospectus, the proceeds held in trust will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business
combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be
used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
complete a business combination.

The payment to Crescendo Advisors II, an affiliate of Eric S. Rosenfeld, our
chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president, of a monthly fee
of $7,500 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Crescendo Advisors II for our benefit and is not intended to provide
Mr. Rosenfeld compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and
fees for similar services in the New York metropolitan area, that the fee
charged by Crescendo Advisors II is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of a business combination or the distribution of the trust account to
our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, special
advisors, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render
in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.
Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in
trust and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant
to the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business
combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses” and “Working
capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, taxes and reserves.”
Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,
we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $220,000, or $248,750
if the over-allotment is exercised in full) for director and officer liability
insurance premiums (approximately $80,000), with the balance of $140,000 (or
$168,750 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) being held in
reserve for tax payments and in the event due diligence, taxes, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described above. In addition to the foregoing,
interest earned on the funds in the trust account of up to $200,000 may be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements if we have not 
consummated a business combination by the one year anniversary of the date of 
this prospectus. Such amount would be added to our excess working capital. We 
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the 
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the funds 
available to us to pay to consultants to assist us with our search for a 
target business. We could also use a portion of the funds available to us as 
a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of 
intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for 
transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target
businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although
we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of
intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target
business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop”
provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business
combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of
such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our
not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, conducting due diligence
with respect to, or completing a business combination with, a potential target
business.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States “government
securities” so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

The allocation of net proceeds not held in trust represents our best estimate of
the intended uses of these funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be
inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described
categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the up to $360,000 fee payable
to EarlyBirdCapital, the representative of the underwriters, upon the
consummation of a business combination for acting as our investment banker on a
non-exclusive basis to assist us in structuring a business combination and
negotiating its terms (but not for purposes of locating potential target
candidates for our business combination). The funds used to pay the
representative will not be available to us to use in connection with or
following the business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used
in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of
the trust fund were insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our initial stockholders have agreed to advance
us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be
no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

Eric S. Rosenfeld has advanced to us a total of $90,000 which was used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for
SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and legal and audit fees and expenses. The
loan will be payable without interest on the earlier of May 15, 2007 or the
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering available to us.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts we can receive from the trust account)
to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not
consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

stock cannot be determined until the reorganization is completed, we presently
anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering will be between $72.2
million and $98.3 million and up to $113.3 million assuming an increase in the
estimated value of the common stock sold in the reorganization by 15%. 

       We intend to use the net proceeds received from the stock offering as
follows:

                                                                       Maximum,

       ViewPoint Financial Group will retain up to 50% of the net offering
proceeds and will purchase all of the capital stock of ViewPoint Bank to be
issued in the reorganization in exchange for the remaining offering proceeds,
which will be an amount sufficient for ViewPoint Bank to have at least 10% core
capital upon completion of the offering. ViewPoint Financial Group intends to
use a portion of the retained net proceeds to make a loan directly to the
employee stock ownership plan to enable the employee stock ownership plan to
purchase up to a number of shares equal to 3.6% of the shares outstanding after
the offering. Based upon the issuance to the employee stock ownership plan of
596,700 shares of common stock and 807,300 shares of common stock at the minimum
and maximum of the estimated offering range, respectively, the loan to the
employee stock ownership plan would be $6.0 million and $8.1 million,
respectively. The remaining net proceeds retained by ViewPoint Financial 
Group initially may be used to invest in U.S. Government and federal agency 
securities of various maturities, mortgage-backed or other securities, 
deposits in either ViewPoint Bank or other financial institutions, or a 
combination thereof. The net proceeds may ultimately be used to:

        º support ViewPoint Bank's lending activities;

        º repay borrowings in the ordinary course of business;

        º support the future expansion of operations through the establishment
          of additional banking offices, loan production offices or other
          customer facilities or through acquisitions of other financial
          institutions or branch offices, although no such acquisition
          transactions are specifically being considered at this time; or

        º support general corporate purposes.

       We anticipate that over the next few years, based on and subject to local
market conditions, we will open additional branch offices in our existing market
area and loan production offices that complement our existing branch network. We
have not determined, however, any specific locations for future branch office
expansion.

       Except as described above, neither ViewPoint Financial Group nor
ViewPoint Bank has any specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this
offering and has not allocated a specific portion of the proceeds to any
particular use. 

       The net proceeds from the offering may also be used for other business
and investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special cash
dividends, possible repurchases of the common stock, or returns of capital.
ViewPoint MHC and ViewPoint Bank have committed, however, not to take any action
to further the payment of any return of capital on the common stock during the
one-year period subsequent to completion of the offering. In addition, the
Office of Thrift Supervision generally will not permit us to repurchase shares
of common stock for one year after completion of this offering, except to cover
share awards under the stock-based incentive plan approved by stockholders and
tax qualified employee stock benefit plans. Management may consider expanding or
diversifying its activities, as such opportunities become available.

       Following the completion of the reorganization, to the extent permitted
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which generally prohibits repurchases for
one year, and based upon then existing facts and circumstances, our board of
directors may determine to repurchase shares of common stock, subject to any
applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. These facts and circumstances
may include but not be limited to:

        º market and economic factors, including the price at which the stock is
          trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of
          other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk
          involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value
          and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and an
          improvement in our return on equity;

        º the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue
          additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund
          employee stock benefit plans; and

        º any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best
          interests of ViewPoint Financial Group and its stockholders.

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of our board of
directors that ViewPoint Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable
regulatory requirements after any such repurchases.

       The portion of the net proceeds used by ViewPoint Financial Group to
purchase the capital stock of ViewPoint Bank will be added to ViewPoint Bank's
general funds to be used for general corporate purposes, including increased 
lending activities. The amount of net proceeds received by ViewPoint Bank 
will further strengthen ViewPoint Bank's capital position, which already 
exceeds all regulatory requirements. After the reorganization, based upon 
the maximum of the estimated offering range, ViewPoint Bank's tangible 
capital ratio will be approximately 10.0%. As a result, ViewPoint Bank 
will continue to be a well-capitalized institution.

       The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the offering may be
more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the number
of shares to be issued in the offering is adjusted to reflect a change in the
estimated pro forma market value of ViewPoint Financial Group. In addition,
payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at
ViewPoint Bank will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by
ViewPoint Bank but will result in a reduction of ViewPoint Bank's interest
expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing
certificates or other deposit accounts."

$39.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering costs. If the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the
selling stockholders will receive approximately $6.1 million in net proceeds at
an initial public offering price of $7.00 per share. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders other than proceeds
from any sales made by Paik Ki Hong in an amount sufficient to pay in full his
existing note payable to us.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
establish a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future
access to public capital markets. We intend to use the net proceeds of this
offering as follows:

        º approximately $6.0 million to establish a manufacturing facility in
          China;

        º approximately $5.0 million to reduce our outstanding borrowings under
          our revolving line of credit;

        º $1.8 million to repay outstanding indebtedness as required under our
          term loan agreement; and

        º the remainder for general corporate purposes, including funding our
          working capital requirements, increasing research and development
          activities and sales and marketing resources to enter new markets, and
          acquiring complementary businesses, products or technologies.

    Our term loan and revolving line of credit each have an interest rate of
prime plus one-half percent. Our term loan has a maturity date of the earlier of
July 2008 or the completion of this offering. Our revolving line of credit has a
maturity date of July 2008. We have used the proceeds to date under our term
loan to repay $950,000 in outstanding principal amount, plus accrued interest,
on our convertible promissory notes issued in December 2005.

    We are in the preliminary stages of establishing a manufacturing facility in
China and cannot estimate with certainty the expenditures that will be required
to develop this facility. We currently believe that we may spend up to
$6 million to develop this facility over the next 12 months. We may also use a
portion of the net proceeds to us to fund possible investments in, or
acquisitions of, complementary businesses, products or technologies or to
establish joint ventures. We have no current agreements or commitments with
respect to any investment, acquisition or joint venture, and we currently are
not engaged in negotiations with respect to any investment, acquisition or joint
venture.

    Other than amounts to be used to pay offering fees and expenses, the amount
and timing of what we spend for the intended uses of proceeds above may vary
significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future net
sales and cash generated by operations and the other factors described in this
prospectus under ""Risk Factors."" We will have broad discretion in the way that
we use the net proceeds of this offering. Pending their ultimate use, we intend
to invest the net proceeds to us from this offering in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

offered by us are estimated to be approximately $15.9 million, after deducting
the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses and assuming an
initial public offering price of $4.00, or approximately $18.4 million if the
over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriter in full.

    At the completion of this offering we anticipate repaying principal debt and
note obligations of approximately $0.9 million, excluding the promissory notes
discussed in the next paragraph. These obligations include $750,000 accruing
interest at an annual rate of 1.5% over the current prime rate with maturity
dates of November 2006 and January 2007, $121,085 accruing interest at an annual
rate of 10% with a maturity date of December 2006, $34,679 accruing interest at
an annual rate of 8% with a maturity date of January 2008, and $13,750 accruing
interest at an annual rate of 10% with a maturity date of December 2009. We
originally used the proceeds from the debt being repaid to fund our sales and
development efforts, including our general and administrative expenses, as well
as repaying prior debt obligations.

    In addition to the use of proceeds set forth above we anticipate repaying
our outstanding 12% convertible bridge notes sold in March, July and August 2006
in the principal amount of $5.7 million. This assumes the holders of such notes
do not elect to convert the principal and accrued interest into shares of our
common stock. These notes mature on the earlier of 30 days following completion
of this offering or March 10, 2007. To the extent the March, July and August
2006 bridge notes are converted, we will not be required to use the proceeds of
this offering to retire them and such funds will be available for working
capital and general corporate purposes, including payment of associate and
management compensation. We will also be repaying $877,557 of accrued interest
on our outstanding debt, including $322,643 of accrued interest on the March,
July and August 2006 bridge notes, using proceeds from this offering. We do not
intend to raise any additional funds from other sources outside this offering.
    The offering is being conducted principally to provide sufficient funding
for the development of our business and to meet maturing debt obligations. We
plan to pay certain debt and accrued interest totaling $7.5 million, provide
funding of $8.1 million to continue the development and sales efforts for our
products and services and make payments in the aggregate amount of $80,000 in
management compensation due upon the completion of this offering. We expect to
apply any remaining cash to future capital expenditures or other investments as
they may be identified, considered and approved. At present, no such purchases
or other opportunities have been identified.

    The following table sets forth the approximate dollar amounts and
percentages of the estimated net proceeds, the purposes for which the proceeds
are to be used and the order in which the proceeds will be used for the purposes
stated:

the particular uses for the net proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we
will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amount and timing of actual
expenditures may vary significantly depending on a number of factors, such as
the availability of debt financing on terms advantageous to us, the pace of our
growth in existing markets, opportunities for expansion into new markets through
acquisition or otherwise and the amount of cash otherwise used by operations.
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility and discretion in
applying the net proceeds of this offering. Until we use the proceeds for a
particular purpose, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering
generally in short-term, investment-grade instruments, interest-bearing
securities or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States."

offered by us are estimated to be approximately $15.9 million, after deducting
the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses and assuming an
initial public offering price of $4.00, or approximately $18.4 million if the
over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriter in full.

    At the completion of this offering we anticipate repaying principal debt and
note obligations of approximately $0.9 million, excluding the promissory notes
discussed in the next paragraph. These obligations include $750,000 accruing
interest at an annual rate of 1.5% over the current prime rate with maturity
dates of November 2006 and January 2007, $121,085 accruing interest at an annual
rate of 10% with a maturity date of December 2006, $34,679 accruing interest at
an annual rate of 8% with a maturity date of January 2008, and $13,750 accruing
interest at an annual rate of 10% with a maturity date of December 2009. We
originally used the proceeds from the debt being repaid to fund our sales and
development efforts, including our general and administrative expenses, as well
as repaying prior debt obligations.

    In addition to the use of proceeds set forth above we anticipate repaying
our outstanding 12% convertible bridge notes sold in March, July and August 2006
in the principal amount of $5.7 million. This assumes the holders of such notes
do not elect to convert the principal and accrued interest into shares of our
common stock. These notes mature on the earlier of 30 days following completion
of this offering or March 10, 2007. To the extent the March, July and August
2006 bridge notes are converted, we will not be required to use the proceeds of
this offering to retire them and such funds will be available for working
capital and general corporate purposes, including payment of associate and
management compensation. We will also be repaying $877,557 of accrued interest
on our outstanding debt, including $322,643 of accrued interest on the March,
July and August 2006 bridge notes, using proceeds from this offering. We do not
intend to raise any additional funds from other sources outside this offering.
    The offering is being conducted principally to provide sufficient funding
for the development of our business and to meet maturing debt obligations. We
plan to pay certain debt and accrued interest totaling $7.5 million, provide
funding of $8.1 million to continue the development and sales efforts for our
products and services and make payments in the aggregate amount of $80,000 in
management compensation due upon the completion of this offering. We expect to
apply any remaining cash to future capital expenditures or other investments as
they may be identified, considered and approved. At present, no such purchases
or other opportunities have been identified.

    The following table sets forth the approximate dollar amounts and
percentages of the estimated net proceeds, the purposes for which the proceeds
are to be used and the order in which the proceeds will be used for the purposes
stated:

option is fully exercised). We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares by the selling shareholders.

    We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering and borrowings under our
revolving credit facility as follows:

   •  approximately $45.0 million to purchase certain equipment currently under   
      operating leases, including prepayment penalties,

      indebtedness, related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes, 
  
   •  $27.0 million to acquire all of the outstanding Seller preferred shares, and
  
   •  $2.0 million to our sponsors to terminate our advisory services agreement.  

    As noted above, we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this
offering to repurchase our 9% senior secured notes due 2010 and to pay a fee to
terminate our advisory services agreement. We will incur a pre-tax charge in the
fiscal period that the tender offer is consummated of approximately
$13.2 million, representing the tender offer premium and the write-off of debt
issuance costs associated with these notes. In addition, we will incur a pre-tax
charge of $2.0 million in the fiscal period that the termination fee is paid to
our sponsors."

consummation of this offering, we have agreed to pay Rothschild Inc. a fee of
$2.0 million for its services, which we and Cerberus will pay from the proceeds
of this offering.

The Sale of Ordinary Shares by the Selling Shareholders

    Our selling shareholders are directly owned by Bermuda holding companies,
the Bermuda Parents, with identical share ownership and capital structures
consisting of preferred shares and common shares. The Bermuda Parents do not own
any other significant assets or conduct any other significant activities outside
of their indirect investment in us and the value of the Bermuda Parents is
derived exclusively with reference to our value. No distributions may be made to
holders of common shares of the Bermuda Parents unless all accrued and unpaid
dividends on their preferred shares have been paid and the preferred shares have
been redeemed or otherwise retired. As of September 30, 2006, the accrued
dividends and liquidation preference payment required to pay all accrued
dividends and redeem the preferred shares of all of the Bermuda Parents was
$393.5 million. Cerberus owns 99.6% and members of our senior management
identified under ""Principal and Selling Shareholders"" own 0.4% of the preferred
shares of the Bermuda Parents.

    We expect the net proceeds from the sale of the ordinary shares by the
selling shareholders to be distributed to the Bermuda Parents and used first to
pay all accrued dividends and to redeem all of the preferred shares. We expect
any remaining net proceeds from the sale of the ordinary shares by the selling
shareholders, including any remaining proceeds from exercise of the
over-allotment option by the underwriters, to be distributed to holders of the
common shares of the Bermuda Parents. Cerberus owns 86.0% of the common shares
of the Bermuda Parents and members of our senior management and a consultant
identified under ""Principal and Selling Shareholders"" own 14.0% of the common
shares of the Bermuda Parents.

    In addition to common shares owned by members of our senior management and a
consultant described above, members of our senior management and Board of
Directors also own options to purchase common shares of the Bermuda Parents
exercisable upon the closing of this offering. If all such options are
exercised, Cerberus would own 83.0% of the common shares of the Bermuda Parents
and members of our senior management, Board of Directors and a consultant would
own 17.0% of the common shares. See ""Principal and Selling Shareholders"" for
more information regarding our ownership structure and our indirect
shareholders."

March 30, 2006 to finance part of the purchase price for TexCal. We borrowed
$119.5 million under the revolving credit facility on March 31, 2006 to finance
the remainder of the purchase price for TexCal and to pay related fees and
expenses. As of November 10, 2006, $548.5 million was outstanding under the
credit facilities. As of that date, the interest rate on amounts borrowed under
the second lien term loan was 9.9% and the interest rate on amounts borrowed
under the revolving credit facility was 8.1%. The second lien term loan facility
matures on March 30, 2011 and the revolving credit facility matures on March 30,
2009.

    We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our
common stock in this offering by the selling stockholders, one of which is a
family trust controlled by our CEO. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters
are lenders under our credit facilities and will therefore receive a portion of
the net proceeds of this offering."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay indebtedness we

remaining net proceeds will be used for general business purposes. At September
30, 2006, the aggregate principal amount owed under the subordinated
intercompany notes was $774 million, and in October 2006, we repaid $324 million

this offering are not sufficient to repay the subordinated intercompany notes in
full, we expect to repay the remaining amounts owed with available cash balances
from sources permitted by the covenants under our revolving credit facility.

stock in this offering will be approximately $67.4 million, or approximately
$77.9 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
based upon the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses.

    We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:
   •  approximately $18.0 million for sales, marketing and general administrative 
      activities;

   •  approximately $8.0 million for capital equipment and tenant improvements;   
      and                                                                         
  
   •  the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

    We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the potential acquisition of,
or investment in, other product candidates, intellectual property rights or
companies that complement our business, although we have no current
understandings, commitments or agreements to do so.

    This expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts we
actually expend in these areas may vary significantly from our current
intentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including FDA clearance for
our products, future sales growth, success of research and product development
efforts, cash generated from future operations and actual expenses to operate
our business. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with
certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon
the completion of this offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying
on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of
this offering.

    The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several factors,
including the progress of our research and development efforts and the amount of
cash used by our operations. Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

    We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments funding received from
our collaboration agreements, and interest earned on these balances will be
sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital
expenditures through at least the next 24 months."

common stock being offered by us pursuant to this prospectus, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, will be
approximately $1,260.3 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale
of up to 13,235,250 shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders,
which include affiliates of Merrill Lynch & Co., an underwriter in this
offering, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares from the selling stockholders.

    We intend to use the net proceeds to us from the sale of common stock to
repay borrowings outstanding under the Hertz Holdings Loan Facility and to pay
related transaction fees and expenses. Hertz Holdings used the proceeds of the
Hertz Holdings Loan Facility plus cash on hand to pay special cash dividends of
$4.32 per share, or approximately $999.2 million in the aggregate, to its common
stockholders on June 30, 2006 and related fees and expenses. Of this amount,
approximately $991.4 million, or over 99%, was paid to investment funds
associated with or designated by the Sponsors on a pro rata basis according to
their ownership of our common stock. Borrowings outstanding under the Hertz
Holdings Loan Facility, which currently has a stated maturity of June 30, 2007,
bear interest, at our option, at a fluctuating rate of interest measured by
reference to either (1) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate, or ""LIBOR,""
plus a borrowing margin or (2) an alternate base rate plus a borrowing margin.
See ""Description of Certain Indebtedness—Hertz Holdings Loan Facility."" As of
September 30, 2006, borrowings under the Hertz Holdings Loan Facility bore
interest at 8.6%. Because affiliates of Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch & Co.,
Goldman, Sachs & Co., JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are lenders under the Hertz
Holdings Loan Facility, affiliates of such underwriters will receive a
substantial portion of the proceeds of this offering. See ""Underwriting.""

    Prior to the consummation of this offering, we intend to declare a special
cash dividend, payable promptly following the completion of this offering to
holders of record of our common stock on the dividend record date. This dividend
will be funded by the proceeds to us from the sale of our common stock offered
hereby after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, offering expenses
and the amount required to repay borrowings outstanding under the Hertz Holdings
Loan Facility. This dividend will be payable in an amount of approximately $1.12
per share, or $260.3 million in the aggregate.

    The dividend record date for this potential dividend will precede the
consummation of this offering, and investors in this offering will not be
entitled to receive any payments or distributions in connection with this
additional dividend on shares purchased in this offering."

$54.7 million, based on the initial public offering price of $12.50 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option

approximately $57.8 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares of common stock by the selling stockholders as a result of the exercise
by the underwriters of their over-allotment option.
 
If we fund the following solely with the net proceeds from this offering without
allocating funds from other sources, we currently estimate that we will use:
 
•  approximately $10 million of these net proceeds to fund development of our    
   biodefense product candidates, comprised of approximately $3 million for label
   expansions and improvements for BioThrax, approximately $2 million for a next 
   generation anthrax vaccine candidate and approximately $5 million for our     
   anthrax immune globulin candidate;                                            
  
•  approximately $19 million of these net proceeds to fund clinical development  
   of our commercial product candidates, comprised of approximately $6 million   
   for our typhoid vaccine candidate and approximately $13 million for our       
   hepatitis B therapeutic vaccine candidate;                                    
  
•  approximately $25 million of these net proceeds to fund a portion of the      
   construction, validation and qualification costs for our new manufacturing    
   facility in Lansing, Michigan and the initial engineering design and          
   preliminary utility build out of our manufacturing facilities in Frederick,   
   Maryland; and                                                                 
  
•  the balance of these net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may   
   include the expansion of our sales and marketing organization, the acquisition
   or in license of technologies, products or businesses, working capital and    
   capital expenditures.                                                         
 
This expected use of proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based
upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon numerous factors,
including the progress of our development and commercialization efforts, the
progress of our clinical trials and our operating costs and capital
expenditures, including the timing of, and the costs involved in, constructing
our new manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan and the build out of our
manufacturing facilities in Frederick, Maryland. As a result, we will retain
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We
have no current understandings, commitments or agreements to acquire or in
license any technologies, products or businesses using the net proceeds from
this offering.
 
Based on our planned use of proceeds described above, we expect that the net
proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to enable us to complete:
 
•  for our biodefense product candidates, the work necessary to support our      
   applications to the FDA to further extend the shelf life and reduce the number
   of required doses for BioThrax, stability testing, animal efficacy studies and
   exploration of an alternative delivery system for a next generation anthrax   
   vaccine candidate and animal efficacy studies and a Phase I safety and        
   pharmacokinetic trial of our anthrax immune globulin candidate; and           

•   for our commercial product candidates, a Phase II clinical trial and a      
    disease surveillance study and the manufacture of initial clinical material 
    for a Phase III clinical trial of our typhoid vaccine candidate and a Phase 
    II clinical trial of our hepatitis B therapeutic vaccine candidate.         

It is possible that we will not achieve the progress that we expect because the
actual costs and timing of development, particularly clinical trials, are
difficult to predict, subject to substantial risks and often vary depending on
the particular indication and development strategy.
 
We do not expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, committed sources
of funds and net proceeds from this offering alone will be sufficient to enable
us to fund the completion of the development of any of our product candidates or
all of the construction costs of our new manufacturing facility in Lansing. We
expect to continue to fund a significant portion of our development and
commercialization costs with internally generated funds from sales of BioThrax.
In particular, our planned use of proceeds described above assumes that we will
fund continued development of our recombinant bivalent botulinum vaccine
candidate, our botulinum immune globulin candidate, our group B streptococcus
vaccine candidate and our commercial preclinical product candidates with funds
from sales of BioThrax and grant funding without allocating any of the net
proceeds from this offering. Accordingly, our need for additional external
sources of funds for these purposes will depend significantly on the level and
timing of our sales of this product. Our business plan also contemplates that we
will raise $10 million to $20 million of additional external debt financing to
fund the Lansing facility construction and to provide additional financial
flexibility. If we do not obtain this additional debt financing, we may need to
reduce spending for other purposes in order to complete this construction
project.
 
Pending use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds
in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

            commercialization of our ThermaCool system;                            

       •    $6 million for research and development activities, including support  
            of product development, regulatory and clinical study initiatives; and 

       •    $5.0 million for repayment of our working capital line with GE Capital,
            $2.5 million of which bears interest at 10.2% per annum and is due in  
            November 2008, and $2.5 million of which bears interest at 10.6% per   
            annum and is due in December 2008.                                     

We intend to use the remainder of our net proceeds for general corporate
purposes. We may use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire complementary
products, technologies or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements
or commitments to complete any such transaction and are not involved in
negotiations to do so. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be
based on many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated
growth of our business. Pending these uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds
from this offering primarily in investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

$83.2 million, (or $93.0 million if the underwriters exercise the over-allotment
option in full) after deducting the underwriting discounts, commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

     We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for the
following purposes:

     •        approximately $30.0 million to purchase or prepay for solar cells   
              and silicon raw materials;

              manufacturing, including purchasing solar cell equipment and        
              construction of our solar cell facilities, to support our core solar
              module business and for the expansion of our solar module           
              manufacturing capabilities; and                                     
    
     •        the remaining amount for other general corporate purposes.          

     We have not yet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and
therefore cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes
discussed above. The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending
on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological
developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our
management will have significant discretion in the allocation of the net
proceeds we will receive for this offering. Depending on future events and other
changes in the business climate, we may determine at a later time to use the net
proceeds for different purposes. Pending their use, we intend to place our net
proceeds in short-term bank deposits.

price of $17.00 per share, will be approximately $46.9 million, after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses.
We will not receive any of the proceeds from the 4,375,000 shares of common
stock sold by the selling stockholders, including any proceeds they receive if
the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option. We expect to receive
proceeds of $15,946 from the payment by members of our management of the
exercise price of options to purchase 159,460 shares of our common stock that
they intend to exercise in connection with this offering.

    We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of common stock by us and
from borrowings under the new senior credit agreement to reduce our outstanding
indebtedness, to pay debt issuance costs and to pay IPO completion bonuses. We
intend to use approximately $20.7 million of the net proceeds from this offering
to repurchase our senior subordinated notes and to pay all accrued and unpaid
cash and payment-in-kind interest on those notes through the closing date of
this offering. We also intend to use approximately $26.2 million of the net
proceeds from this offering, together with approximately $19.8 million of
borrowings under our new senior credit agreement, to repay our anticipated
borrowings, and accrued interest thereon, under our existing senior credit
agreement as of the closing date of this offering.

    The principal terms of the indebtedness outstanding as of June 30, 2006
being repaid consist of the following:

         •$20.5 million of senior subordinated notes issued in December 2005
          (which includes accrued and unpaid interest). The senior subordinated
          notes bear cash interest at a fixed rate of 12%, payable quarterly in
          arrears on the accrued principal balance, plus payment-in-kind
          interest at a fixed rate of 1.5%, payable quarterly in arrears. The
          senior subordinated notes mature on December 16, 2012 and the notes
          issued as payment-in-kind interest mature on May 16, 2013. We used the
          net proceeds from the sale of the senior subordinated notes to repay a
          portion of our then-existing indebtedness, to repurchase a portion of
          our preferred stock and to pay a portion of the dividend to our common
          stockholders in connection with the Recapitalization.

         •$4.8 million of revolving credit borrowings and $39.7 million
          outstanding under our term loan facility under our existing senior
          credit agreement. Under our term loan facility, principal is due in
          quarterly payments of $1.0 million, starting on March 31, 2006, and
          increasing to $2.5 million through December 16, 2011. Our revolving
          credit facility terminates on December 16, 2010. As of June 30, 2006,
          our term loan facility bore interest at a rate of 9.25% per annum and
          our revolving credit facility bore interest at a rate of 10.25% per
          annum. We used the initial borrowings under our existing senior credit
          agreement to repay a portion of our then-existing indebtedness, to
          repurchase a portion of our preferred stock and to pay a portion of
          the dividend to our common stockholders in connection with the
          Recapitalization.

    All amounts remaining outstanding under our existing senior credit agreement
after application of the net proceeds from this offering will be repaid in
connection with the execution of a new senior credit agreement, which will be
effective upon completion of this offering. Our new senior credit agreement will
include a $15.0 million term loan facility and a revolving credit facility
providing for borrowings of up to $20.0 million."

estimated to be approximately $17,693,000, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds
will be approximately $20,496,950.

      We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering to complete the
clinical studies and non-clinical studies that we believe, based on currently
available information, will be required for us to file an NDA for the use of
CPP-109 to treat cocaine addiction as follows:

   •  approximately $6.5 million will be used to fund our U.S. Phase II clinical 
      trial to evaluate CPP-109 for the treatment of cocaine addiction;          
  
   •  approximately $5.2 million will be used to fund a U.S. Phase III clinical  
      trial to evaluate CPP-109 for the treatment of cocaine addiction, if       
      required; and                                                              
  
   •  up to approximately $4.0 million will be used to fund other costs relating 
      to our filing of an NDA for CPP-109 to treat cocaine addiction, including  
      any Phase I clinical trials and other non-clinical studies that may be     
      required.                                                                  

      Additional net proceeds, if any, will be used for general corporate
purposes, including rent payments for our office facility, compensation payments
to our executive officers and employees and professional fees.

      The above amounts represent our estimate of the costs to fund the above
clinical programs. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to
complete our trials with the amounts specified, and the costs we incur may be
well in excess of the above amounts.

      We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be sufficient
to meet our projected operating requirements for the next 24 months.

      The allocation of the net proceeds of this offering described above
represents our best current estimate of our projected operating requirements.
However, the exact amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several
factors, including the success of our commercialization activities and the
progress of our clinical trials and other development efforts as well as the
amount of cash used in our operations. Accordingly, our management will have
broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the
proceeds of this offering. We reserve the right to change the use of these
proceeds as a result of certain contingencies such as the results of our
commercialization efforts, competitive developments, opportunities to acquire or
in-license products, and other factors.

      Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds of
this offering in short and medium-term, interest bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering as follows:

including our future revenues and cash generated by operations and other factors
we describe in “Risk factors”. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in the
way we use the net proceeds from this offering. Pending their ultimate use, we

by the selling stockholders. 

Based on the foregoing assumptions, we intend to use the net proceeds of $86.3 
million from this offering, together with $47.1 million of cash on hand, for: 

   (i)     the repayment of approximately $30.0 million of indebtedness under 
our senior credit facility;

offering expenses aggregating approximately $11.7 million that are payable by
us.

     Except for funding a $685,848 dividend to Thermo as described under
""Dividend Policy and Restrictions,"" we intend to use the entire net proceeds
from this offering to fund in part the procurement and launch of our
second-generation satellite constellation and related upgrades to our gateways
and other ground facilities. We estimate that the cost to procure and launch
these satellites and upgrade these facilities will be approximately $1.0 billion
to $1.2 billion between now and 2014. We intend to fund the balance of those
costs principally from $100 million of proceeds from the delayed draw term loans
under our credit agreement, the remaining proceeds of sales of our common stock
under Thermo Funding Company's irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement and
approximately $600 million to $800 million in cash generated by our business.
Although we expect our cash flow will be sufficient to pay these costs when due,
if our future revenues or profitability are substantially below our expectations
or the conditions requiring Thermo Funding Company to purchase the stock do not
occur and Thermo Funding Company does not elect to purchase the stock during the
term of the irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement, we will require
additional financing, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain, or we will
have to modify our plans.

underwriters' over-allotment option for the same purpose.

RR MEDIA LTD.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/rr-media-ltd-723250-51881,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/rr-media-ltd-723250-51881,424B4,11/1/2006,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4731999,"We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from the sale of the ordinary
shares we are offering will be approximately $40.6 million, based on the initial
public offering price of $12.50 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, or
approximately $47.3 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full.

We estimate that the net proceeds the selling shareholder will receive from the
sale of the ordinary shares he is offering will be approximately $2.0 million,
based on the initial public offering price of $12.50 per share after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions. We will not receive any proceeds from
the sale of ordinary shares by the selling shareholder.

We intend to invest between $20 million and $30 million of the net proceeds we
receive from this offering in making acquisitions of, or establishing,
additional teleports, initially in the United States and subsequently in Asia. 
The cost of acquiring or establishing such operations will include the cost of
fixed assets related to transmission equipment and playout equipment and can
vary between $5 to $15 million per teleport, depending, among other things, on
the location of the teleport and the time it will take to establish the local
teleport.

We intend to use the balance of the proceeds for working capital and general
corporate purposes, which will include an expansion of our sales and marketing
efforts in the markets in which we currently operate and in the markets in which
our additional teleports will be located. We currently do not have specific
plans for the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts. We also may use a
portion of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in, or acquisitions of,
complementary businesses, products, services or technologies.

Currently, we have not identified any specific teleports or complementary
businesses to acquire nor do we have any current agreements or commitments with
respect to any investment or acquisition. Therefore, we may invest more than
$30 million or less than $20 million of the net proceeds we receive from this
offering in making acquisitions of, or establishing, additional teleports. In
addition, the actual use of the proceeds may vary significantly and will depend
on a number of factors, including our future revenue and cash generated by
operations and the other factors described in ""Risk Factors."" Accordingly, our
management will have broad discretion in applying our net proceeds from this
offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds in high
quality, investment grade instruments, which include corporate, financial
institution, federal agency or U.S. government obligations."

offering, at the initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, will be
approximately $23.8 million after deducting underwriting commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the offering is oversubscribed, we
intend to sell through the underwriter up to 214,000 additional shares, and if
all such shares are sold, we estimate that our total net proceeds will be
approximately $26.7 million. Because we have not conditioned the offering on the
sale of a minimum number of shares and because the public offering is a best
efforts offering and there is no minimum number of shares to be sold, we are
presenting this information assuming that we sell 10%, 50% and 100% of the
1,786,000 shares of common stock that we are offering hereby.

------
(1) Assumes the sale of 10%, 50% and 100%, as indicated, of the 1,786,000 shares 
    offered at the initial public offering price of $14.00 per share.            

(2) Represents a 3.5% underwriter’s commission on the gross public offering      
    proceeds above payable to FIG Partners. Assumes that the underwriter receives
    the commission on all shares sold in the offering. See “Underwriting.”       

We intend to contribute all of the net proceeds of this offering to Sonabank to
provide capital to support our internal asset growth as well as the asset growth
expected to result from the three branches we will acquire in the merger with
1st Service. We also plan to open a new branch in Warrenton, Virginia, in the
fourth quarter of 2006, which should generate additional growth, requiring
additional capital. We estimate that the cost to open this branch office will be
$402,000 and that operating costs are not expected to exceed $300,000 per year.

Sonabank will use any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes,
which may include, among other things, our working capital needs to support its
growth, including development of additional banking offices. Additionally, we
may use a portion of the net proceeds to finance branch or bank acquisitions,
though we have no present plans in that regard.

Until we use the proceeds, we will invest them temporarily in short-term U.S.
government, U.S. government agency or other investment grade securities. The
precise amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds will depend upon
market conditions and the availability of other funds, among other factors. From
time to time, we may engage in additional capital financings as we determine to
be appropriate based upon our needs and prevailing market conditions. These
additional capital financings may include the sale of securities other than, or
in addition to, common stock."

(1)   Excludes $50.0 million of additional proceeds from the sale of 5,000,000     
      co-investment units to our sponsors to be paid to us immediately prior to our
      consummation of a business combination.                                      
   
(2)   The offering expenses will be primarily funded from the proceeds of this     
      offering. All of the offering expenses to date have been paid from advances  
      we received from our founders described below. These advances will be repaid 
      within 60 days from the consummation of this offering. During the 30-day     
      period immediately following the consummation of this offering, interest     
      income on the trust account may be released to us on a weekly basis to fund  
      our working capital requirements.                                            
   
(3)   Following consummation of this offering, we believe the funds available to us
      outside of the trust account, together with interest income of up to         
      $3.9 million on the balance of the trust account to be released to us to fund
      our working capital requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate  
      for at least the next 24 months, assuming a business combination is not      
      completed during that time. We expect our primary liquidity requirements     
      during that period to include approximately $1,700,000 for expenses for the  
      due diligence and investigation of a target business or businesses;          
      approximately $1,700,000 for legal, accounting and other expenses associated 
      with structuring, negotiating and documenting an initial business            
      combination; an aggregate of up to $240,000 for administrative services and  
      support payable to Berggruen Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Mr. Berggruen,  
      representing $10,000 per month for up to 24 months beginning upon            
      consummation of this offering; $125,000 as a reserve for liquidation         
      expenses; $34,000 for legal and accounting fees relating to our SEC reporting
      obligations; and approximately $101,000 for general working capital that will
      be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. These expenses are estimates
      only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from 
      the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and  
      accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating
      and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of 
      that business combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended   
      use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
     allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
     estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from 
     our excess working capital. Any such interest income not used to fund our 
     working capital requirements or repay advances from our founders or for 
     due diligence or legal, accounting and non-due diligence expenses will be 
     usable by us to pay other expenses that may exceed our current estimates.                                      

A total of approximately $466.5 million (or approximately $535.9 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the sponsors’ warrants described in this
prospectus, and $16.3 million (or $18.8 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions, will be placed in a trust account at Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as
trustee. Except for a portion of the interest income released to us, the
proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. All
amounts held in the trust account that are not:
 
  •  distributed to public stockholders who exercise redemption rights, 
 
  •  released to us as interest income, or                              
 
  •  payable to the underwriters for deferred discounts and commissions,
     will be released to us on closing of our initial business combination.
 
Our initial business combination will be with one or more target businesses
which have a fair market value of at least 80% of the sum of the balance in the
trust account plus the proceeds of the co-investment (excluding deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions of $16.3 million or $18.8 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the time of such
business combination, subject to:
 
    •  a majority of our public stockholders voting in favor of the business      
       combination and less than 20% of the public stockholders electing to       
       exercise their redemption rights and                                       
   
    •  such deferred underwriting discount and commission having been paid to the 
       underwriters.                                                              

If our initial business combination involves a transaction in which we acquire
less than a 100% interest in the target company, the value of that interest that
we acquire will be equal to at least 80% of the sum of the balance in the trust
account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions) plus the
proceeds of the co-investment. In all instances, we would be the controlling
shareholder of the target company. The key factors that we will rely on in
determining controlling shareholder status would be our acquisition of at least
51% of the voting equity interests of the target company and control of the
majority of any governing body of the target company. We will not consider any
transaction that does not meet such criteria.
 
On release of funds from the trust account and after payment of the redemption
price to any public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights, the
underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions,
and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a
portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our
initial combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for using stock
or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account
for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of
operations of the acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital.
 
Upon the consummation of this offering, we have agreed to pay Berggruen
Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Mr. Berggruen, a total of $10,000 per month for
office space, administrative services and secretarial support until the earlier
of our consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. This
arrangement is being agreed to by Berggruen Holdings, Inc. for our benefit and
is not intended to provide Berggruen Holdings, Inc. compensation in lieu of a
management fee or other remuneration because it is anticipated that the expenses
to be paid by Berggruen Holdings, Inc. will approximate the monthly
reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon consummation of a
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees. Prior to the consummation of this offering, Berggruen Holdings has agreed
to provide us with office space, administrative services and secretarial support
at no charge.
 
We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be monitored
or performed by Mr. Berggruen and the Berggruen Holdings’ investment
professionals made available to us. Additionally, we may engage market research
firms and/or third party consultants. Mr. Berggruen, his affiliates or
associates, will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of
prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities. Our audit committee will review and approve all expense
reimbursements made to Mr. Berggruen and any expense reimbursements payable to
members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of
directors, with the interested director or directors abstaining from such review
and approval.
 
We believe that amounts not held in trust and the interest income of up to
$3.9 million earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us (as
described in more detail below) will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses
to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that
in-depth due diligence will be undertaken only after we have negotiated and
signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the
terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our sponsors, Mr. Berggruen or our
directors, but, except for the co-investment, none of such sponsors, Mr.
Berggruen or our directors is under any obligation to advance funds to, or
invest in, us.
 
If we complete a business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Mr. Berggruen and our other directors prior to the business combination’s
closing will become an obligation of the post-combination business, assuming
these out-of-pocket expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing.
These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would
be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined
business. Mr. Berggruen and our other directors may, as part of any such
combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the
target business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause Mr.
Berggruen and our other directors to view such potential business combination
unfavorably and result in a conflict of interest.
 
As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsors have advanced to us a total of
$250,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, NASD
registration fee, American Stock Exchange fee and accounting and legal fees and
expenses. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due within
60 days following the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out
of the interest we receive on the balance of the trust account.
 
The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities” (as such term is defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940) and one or more money market funds, selected by us, which
invest principally in either short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the
United States having a rating in the highest investment category granted thereby
by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or short-term
tax exempt municipal bonds issued by governmental entities located within the
United States, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Interest income of up to $3.9 million on the trust
account balance is releasable to us from the trust account to fund a portion of
our working capital requirements.
 
Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) will be paid to any of Mr. Berggruen or our directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, Mr. Berggruen and our other
directors will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential
target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust account and interest income of up to
$3.9 million that is released to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any,
will be paid to those persons after a business combination.
 
A stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less interest income
released to us from the trust account in the manner described above) only in the
event of our liquidation if we fail to complete a business combination within
the allotted time or if the public stockholder seeks to have us redeem such
shares for cash in connection with a business combination that the public
stockholder voted against and that we actually complete. In no other
circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to
funds in the trust account.
 
On consummation of an initial business combination, the underwriters will
receive the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust
account. If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee
must therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation,
the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interest
thereon, in the trust account and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to
distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with
any accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, to
the public stockholders on a pro rata basis."

(1)Excludes the payment of $100 from Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. for its purchase
option, proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and proceeds
from the exercise of any warrants.

(2)A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee and NASD
filing fee and approximately $79,250 of legal and accounting fees, have been
paid from the funds we received from Mr. Chalopin and an entity wholly-owned by
Mr. Hersov, as described in this section. These funds will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering allocated for the payment of offering expenses.

(3)The underwriters have agreed to deposit discounts and commissions equal to 2.5%
of the gross proceeds ($0.15 per unit, $900,000 in the aggregate, or $1,035,000
in the aggregate if the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full)
into the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of a business
combination or the liquidation of the trust account. They have also agreed to
forfeit any rights to, or claims against, such proceeds, including any interest
thereon (net of taxes payable), unless we successfully consummate a business
combination. The payment of such $900,000, or $1,035,000 in the aggregate if the
underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full, into the trust account
is reflected on this line item.

(4)Miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of our existing stockholders
for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the offering.

(5)These expenses include: potential fees that we may pay to third parties, such as
market research firms and other consultants, that perform due diligence of a
target business on our behalf; any reimbursements to our existing stockholders
in the event and to the extent that they make payments to any third parties that
perform due diligence on our behalf; and any reimbursement to our existing
stockholders for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in performing due diligence.

$33,917,500, or $39,128,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds received by us from this offering and the
private placement will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bank,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The
proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account (except as
described below) until the earlier of the completion of a business combination
or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account (except as described
below) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business or
target businesses with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of a target business or target
businesses may be used to finance operations of such target business or target
businesses or to repay expenses incurred in excess of the amounts not held in
the trust account. Additionally, the proceeds held in the trust account will be
used to pay the underwriters, deferred compensation equal to 2.5% of the gross
proceeds of this offering, or $900,000 ($1,035,000, if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full), upon the consummation of our initial business
combination. In the event that we do not consummate a business combination
within the time limits described in this prospectus, all proceeds held in trust
will be included in the liquidation distribution to our public stockholders.

The remaining $600,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account and up to
$600,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable on
such interest) may be used to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to
consummate a business combination. Interest earned on this trust account and not
released to us will be held in the trust account for use in completing a
business combination, released to investors upon exercise of their conversion
rights or upon liquidation or, in the case of up to $75,000 (or $86,200 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of interest, net of
taxes payable, earned on the underwriters' deferred compensation paid to the
underwriters (less the portion of such funds paid to our public stockholders
upon exercise of their conversion rights) in the event we consummate a business
combination.

We have agreed to pay Shine Media Group Limited, an affiliate of our chief
executive officer and president, an aggregate of $10,000 per month for office
space in New York, Beijing and Shanghai as well as certain administrative,
technology and secretarial services. We believe that, based on rents and fees
for similar services in New York, Beijing and Shanghai, the fee charged by Shine
Media Group Limited is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated third party.

We intend to use working capital of approximately $470,000, for director and
officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $150,000), with the
remaining balance (approximately $320,000) being held in reserve for tax
payments in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by
some or all of our officers and directors, but may also include engaging market
research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will
not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities, in
which event we believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to
cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

We may use a portion of such working capital to pay finders fees, consulting
fees or other similar compensation, make a deposit, lock-up payment, down
payment, fund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a particular proposed
business combination or payment of corporate franchise taxes, although we do not
have any current intention to do so. We believe the net proceeds from the
offering will be sufficient to fund the evaluation, negotiation and other
expenses attendant to consummating a business combination even if we make such a
payment. However, in the event that such deposit or payment were substantial
enough (thereby depleting a significant portion of our assets not held in trust)
or in the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether
as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such deposit or payment
or otherwise) we could be left with insufficient funds to consummate the
business combination or to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with
respect to, other potential target businesses. It is possible that our existing
stockholders could advance us the additional required funds, thereby increasing
the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses that could be reimbursed
following a business combination. If we were unable to secure additional
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the
allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended may be used to finance
the operations of the target business or target businesses, to pay finders fees
or other expenses contingent on consummating a business combination or for
further acquisitions.

As of the date of this prospectus, Jean Chalopin, Kilmer International
Investments Limited, an entity wholly-owned by Robert B. Hersov, Richard Chang,
David Y. Chen, Hock S. Ong, and Estelle Lau have advanced to us a total of
$210,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration
fee and legal and accounting fees and expenses. Messrs. Hersov, Chalopin, Chang
and Chen are each members of our board of directors and Messrs. Chen and Ong and
Ms. Lau are our officers. In connection with these loans, we issued notes to
each of Mr. Chalopin and Kilmer International Investments Limited. The notes
will be payable with 4% annual interest on the earlier of July 12, 2006 or the
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering allocated for the payment of offering expenses.

The net proceeds of this offering and the private placement and the deferred
underwriting discount held in trust, and the remaining net proceeds which are
available to us but which are not immediately required for the purposes set
forth above will be invested only in United States ""government securities,""
defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United States having a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. By restricting the
investment of the proceeds of this offering to these instruments, we intend to
avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act. Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with
the requirements of such act, in the event that the stockholders do not approve
a plan of dissolution and distribution and the funds remain in the trust account
for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment
company and thus required to comply with such act. The interest income derived
from investment of the net proceeds not held in trust (net of taxes payable)
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering and provided that we are
able to withdraw up to $600,000 of interest from the trust account for working
capital purposes, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at
least the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not
consummated during that time.

Other than the $10,000 per month fee for office space and related services
described above, and except for an option to purchase a number of shares of our
common stock as would maintain the respective ownership percentages of the
existing stockholders in the event that the underwriters' over-allotment option
is exercised (which may be deemed compensation), no compensation of any kind
(including finder's and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing
stockholders or any of their affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or
in connection with the consummation of a business combination. However, our
existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
participating in the offering process, identifying potential target businesses,
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent
that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account and from interest earned in the trust account, such out-of-pocket
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination, in which event this reimbursement obligation would in all
likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business or target
businesses. Since the role of present management after a business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination. In the event a business
combination is consummated, there is no limit on the amount of other accountable
out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us, which will be reviewed only by our
board, or a court of competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged.
However, if we do not consummate a business combination, we expect all of the
funds held in trust, including any interest earned on the funds held in trust,
the deferred underwriters' compensation and the proceeds of the private
placement, net of taxes payable and up to $600,000 of interest that may be
released to us to fund our working capital would be distributed pro rata to the
public stockholders, to the extent not subject to third party claims other than
existing stockholder expense reimbursement claims.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including proceeds from the private placement, the deferred underwriters'
compensation any interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, net of up to $600,000 of interest made available to search for and
consummate an acquisition and taxes payable) in the event of the liquidation of
our trust account as part of our plan of dissolution and distribution approved
by our stockholders upon our failure to complete a business combination within
the allotted time. Each public stockholder will also be entitled to receive
funds from the trust account in the event that he, she or it were to convert
shares for cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder votes against and which we actually consummate. In such event, each
such stockholder will receive an amount per-share equal to the amount held in
the trust account, which would include $0.15 attributable to the deferred
portion of the underwriters' compensation and any interest earned on the trust
account (less up to $600,000 of interest that may be released to us to fund
working capital and net of taxes payable), as of two business days prior to the
date that we consummate a business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account."
UNIVERSAL POWER GROUP INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/universal-power-group-inc-720619-51506,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/universal-power-group-inc-720619-51506,424B4,12/22/2006,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4840952,"In this offering we are selling 2,000,000 shares of our common stock and
Zunicom is selling 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, we have
granted the underwriters an option to purchase an additional 450,000 shares to
cover over-allotments. We will not receive any of the proceeds attributable to
the sale of shares by Zunicom. In addition, we have agreed to pay all of the
expenses associated with this offering other than the underwriters’ discount and
commission attributable to the shares sold by Zunicom.

     Based on a public offering price of $7.00 per share, 7% underwriting
commissions and 1% non-accountable expense allowance, we estimate that the net
proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $12.3 million.
Non-accountable expenses are expenses incurred by the representative in
connection with this offering that are payable out of the proceeds of the
offering, but for which it is not required to produce evidence of payment
because we have agreed to pay a fixed percentage of the gross proceeds for this
purpose. If the representative exercises the over-allotment option in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds to us of the offering will be approximately $15.3
million.

     Based on the current status of our business, we intend to use the net
proceeds that we receive from this offering for one or more of the following
purposes:
                                                                                  
     •    Develop and open new regional logistics centers and retail outlets. We  
          plan to open five or six new regional logistics centers and retail      
          outlets over the next two years. Based on our experience with our       
          regional logistics centers in Oklahoma City and Las Vegas, we estimate  
          the total cost of opening a new logistics center retail outlet is       
          approximately $0.5 million to $1.0 million, including inventory         
          purchases. The net proceeds that will be allocated for this purpose will
          be from $2.5 million to $6.0 million.                                   
                                                                                  
     •    Purchase and customize a warehouse management system and related        
          hardware, such as computerized material handling equipment and          
          carousels, and upgrade and improve our other critical information       
          technology systems. We estimate the cost to develop a warehouse         
          management system that meets our needs will be approximately $0.3       
          million, the hardware will be approximately $0.7 million, and the       
          estimated cost of other information technology additions and            
          improvements that we plan to make is $0.1 million to $0.2 million, for a
          total of approximately $1.2 million.                                    
                                                                                  
     •    Increase our sales and marketing department and efforts by adding sales 
          representatives in the United States and abroad and by participating in 
          a greater number of trade shows and other industry events. We estimate  
          that approximately $0.25 million will be allocated for this purpose.    
                                                                                  
     •    Expand our inventory of product and service offerings. To do so, we may 
          have to finance a portion of the tooling and raw material costs that    
          factories will incur to meet our demands. We estimate that approximately
          $0.25 million will be allocated for this purpose.                       
                                                                                  
     •    Expand into new markets, including international markets and the        
          consumer market through retail outlets and online sales. We estimate    
          that approximately $0.5 million will be allocated for this purpose.     
                                                                                  
     •    Develop or acquire manufacturing capability. We have no present         
          commitments, understandings, or agreements as to any acquisition. We    
          cannot estimate how much of the proceeds will be allocated to this use. 

     We will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds
within the categories listed above. The amounts actually expended for these
purposes may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors,
including cash generated by operations, other financing opportunities, evolving
business needs, changes in customer demands and preferences, competitive
developments, new strategic opportunities, cost of materials,
general economic conditions and other factors that we cannot anticipate at this
time. Any unallocated portion of the net proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of
this offering in interest-bearing, investment grade securities. Alternatively,
we may use the net proceeds to temporarily pay down the balance on our working
capital line of credit.

     If the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option, the net proceeds to
us from the sale of those shares will be used to repay the note evidencing the
dividend declared immediately before this offering was effective. The dividend
reflects a portion of our undistributed earnings through the date of this
offering. The exact amount of the dividend, $3 million, is the difference
between $10 million and the gross proceeds realized by Zunicom from the sale of
our shares that it owns that are covered by this prospectus. The dividend is
evidenced by a note payable, which has a maturity date of June 20, 2012 and
bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum. Interest on the unpaid principal
amount of this note is payable quarterly, in arrears, and the principal amount
will be repaid to the extent of the net proceeds from the sale of shares covered
by the over-allotment option and the balance in 16 equal quarterly installments
beginning September 20, 2008.

     We expect that the net proceeds from this offering together with cash flow
from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital
requirements for at least 12 months following this offering. We may be required
to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or other securities
sooner if our operating assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate. We cannot
assure you that any financing of this type would be permissible under our
existing credit facility or, if permitted, would be available or, if available,
what the terms of such a financing would be."

this offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us, and based on the initial public
offering price of US$12.50 per ADS.

    We intend to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering
primarily for the following purposes:

    •  approximately US$50 million to purchase or prepay for raw materials;             
   
    •  approximately US$40 million to expand our manufacturing capacity; and            
   
    •  approximately US$10 million to invest in our research and development activities.

    We intend to use the remaining proceeds for other general corporate purposes
and for potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses and
technologies that we believe will complement our current operations and our
expansion strategies. We do not currently have any agreements or understandings
with third parties to make any material acquisitions of, or investments in,
other businesses.

    Depending on future events and other changes in the business climate, we may
determine at a later time to use the net proceeds for different purposes.
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds to us in short-term
bank deposits, direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government or other
short-term money market instruments. These investments may have a material
adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in
our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a passive foreign investment company
for U.S. federal tax purposes, which could result in negative tax consequences
for you. 

    We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders."

(1)   Includes underwriters’ deferred discount of 3.72% of gross proceeds.

(2)   The proceeds of $200,000 advanced by our existing stockholders in exchange  
      for promissory notes have been used to pay certain expenses of this         
      offering. Upon completion of this offering, such promissory notes will be   
      repaid in full, without interest, from the proceeds of this offering.       

(3)   $7.88 per unit if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised, 
      and approximately $7.86 per unit if the underwriters’ over-allotment option 
      is exercised in full.                                                       

(4)   In addition to the $640,000 of proceeds from this offering not held in      
      trust, up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000 of working capital may be    
      funded from interest earned on the trust account ((i) an aggregate amount of
      up to $1,250,000, within 12 months after the completion of this offering,   
      and (ii) an aggregate amount of up to $750,000 plus any remaining portion of
      the $1,250,000 not previously released to us during the initial 12-month    
      period, during the period that is between 12 months and 24 months after the 
      completion of this offering).                                               

Of the net proceeds of this offering, $91,780,000, or $105,730,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, plus $3,000,000 from
the private placement (accordingly, an aggregate of $94,780,000 or $108,730,000,
respectively), will be placed in a trust account at Smith Barney, a division of
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, as trustee. Additionally, $3,720,000, or $4,278,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount will be deposited into such trust
account. The funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United
States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, in order to comply with certain exemptions
under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our dissolution and liquidation. If we are required to dissolve, we anticipate
we will pay the costs of dissolution and liquidation, which we currently
estimate to be approximately $50,000 to $75,000, from our remaining assets
outside of the trust account. This amount includes all costs and expenses
relating to filing our certificate of dissolution in the State of Delaware, our
winding up and the costs of a proxy statement and meeting relating to the
approval by our stockholders of our dissolution and plan for the distribution of
our assets. While we will seek waivers from all acquisition targets, vendors and
service providers to claims to amounts in the trust account, we cannot guarantee
that we will be able to obtain any such waiver or that any such waiver will be
held valid and enforceable. Our existing stockholders have agreed, subject to
certain exceptions, that they will be personally liable, on a joint and several
basis, to cover claims made by such third parties, but only if, and to the
extent, the claims reduce the amounts in the trust account available for payment
to our stockholders in the event of a liquidation and the claims are made by a
vendor or service provider for services rendered, or products sold, to us or by
a prospective acquisition target. However, our existing stockholders will not
have any personal liability as to any claimed amounts owed to a third party who
executed a waiver (including a prospective acquisition target) or the
underwriters. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of an acquisition target with which we complete
a business combination (excluding the amount held in the trust account
representing a portion of the underwriters’ deferred discount). Any amounts not
paid as consideration to the sellers of the acquisition target will be used to
finance our operations, which may include the acquisition target(s) we acquire
in connection with our initial business combination, to effect other
acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board of directors at
that time.

The payment to S&B Investment Management Group, LLC of a monthly fee of $7,500
is for certain administrative services, including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. Daniel L. Burstein and Samuel L. Schwerin are each Managing
Members of S&B Investment Management Group, LLC and, as a result, will benefit
from our transaction with S&B Investment Management Group, LLC. However, this
arrangement is not intended to provide Mr. Burstein or Mr. Schwerin compensation
in lieu of a salary. In addition, we believe that, based on rents and fees for
similar services in New York, NY, the fees charged by S&B Investment Management
Group, LLC are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from unaffiliated
third parties.

Our existing stockholders have advanced a total of $200,000 in exchange for
promissory notes from us. The promissory notes are payable, without interest,
upon the earlier of (i) the completion of this offering and (ii) September 1,
2007. The proceeds of these promissory notes will be used to pay certain
expenses of this offering, such as legal, accounting and registration fees. Upon
completion of this offering, such promissory notes will be repaid in full,
without interest, from the proceeds of this offering.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with our initial
business combination, either because the consideration for our initial business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event,
the proceeds released to us from the trust account as well as any other net
proceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations, which may include
the operations of an acquisition target that we acquire in our initial business
combination, to effect other acquisitions, for working capital, or for other
corporate purposes, as determined by our board of directors at that time.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account, as set forth in
the immediately succeeding paragraph, and not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in “government securities” 
or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in order to comply with
certain exemptions under the Investment Company Act. The income derived from the
investment of these net proceeds during this period that is not otherwise
returned to public stockholders who vote against a business combination will be
used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon completion of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time, based on the
combination of (1) the $640,000 that we have reserved from the proceeds of this
offering that will not be held in the trust account and (2) up to an aggregate
amount of $2,000,000 from one-half of the interest earned on the trust account,
net of taxes, that will be released to us upon our demand, as follows: (i) an
aggregate amount of up to $1,250,000, within 12 months after the completion of
this offering, and (ii) an aggregate amount of up to $750,000 plus any remaining
portion of the $1,250,000 not previously released to us during the initial
12-month period, during the period that is between 12 months and 24 months after
the completion of this offering.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
a business combination, we will pay S&B Investment Management Group, LLC the
administrative services fee described above. Other than this monthly fee of
$7,500, we will not pay any compensation of any kind (including finders,
consulting or other similar fees) to any of our existing officers, directors or
existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services
that they render in order to effectuate, or in connection with the consummation
of our initial business combination. However, such individuals will receive
reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential acquisition targets, performing business due diligence on
suitable acquisition targets and business combinations, as well as traveling to
and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective acquisition
targets to examine their operations.

We intend to use the funds not held in the trust account (i.e., (1) the $640,000
that we have reserved from the proceeds of this offering that will not be held
in the trust account and (2) up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000 from
one-half of the interest earned on the trust account, net of taxes, that will be
released to us upon our demand, as follows: (i) an aggregate amount of up to
$1,250,000, within 12 months after the completion of this offering, and (ii) an
aggregate amount of up to $750,000 plus any remaining portion of the $1,250,000
not previously released to us during the initial 12-month period, during the
period that is between 12 months and 24 months after the completion of this
offering) for, among other things, due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating a business combination, as well as a
possible down payment, lock-up or “no-shop” provision, or, if necessary, to bear
the costs of dissolution and liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect
a business combination within 18 months after the completion of this offering
(or within 24 months after the completion of this offering if a letter of
intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement has been executed within
18 months after the completion of this offering and our initial business
combination has not yet been consummated within the 18-month period). While we
do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to
fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular proposed business
combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we paid for
the right to receive exclusivity from an acquisition target, the amount that
would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of these funds
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, potential acquisition targets. In addition to the use of funds
described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to
consultants to assist us with our search for an acquisition target. We believe
that the funds not held in the trust account will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses.

Of the foregoing amounts not held in the trust account, we estimate we will use
$1,500,000 for legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the due
diligence investigation, structuring and negotiating of a business combination, 
up to $180,000 for the administrative fee payable to S&B Investment Management 
Group, LLC (if paid for 24 months following the completion of this offering), 
$100,000 for legal and accounting fees relating to our SEC reporting 
obligations and $860,000 for general working capital that can be used
for fairness opinions in connection with our acquisition plans, director and
officer liability insurance premiums, and other miscellaneous expenses and
reserves. We do not believe that we will need to raise additional funds
following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating
our business. However, we may need to raise additional funds through a private
offering of debt or equity securities if funds are required to consummate a
business combination that is presented to us, although we have not entered into
any such arrangements and have no current intention of doing so.

A public stockholder (but not our existing stockholders with respect to any
shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering) will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including the remaining
one-half interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our dissolution and liquidation, or if that public stockholder
(but not our existing stockholders with respect to any shares of our common
stock owned by them) converts such shares into cash in connection with a
business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust account
attributable to the underwriters’ discount held in the trust account (subject to
a $0.2976 per share reduction for public stockholders who vote against our
initial business combination and exercise their conversion rights). In the event
that we are unable to consummate a business combination and the trustee is
forced to dissolve and liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed
that: (1) they will forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds; and (2) the
proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ deferred discount will be distributed
on a pro rata basis among the public stockholders along with any accrued
interest thereon (as applicable)."

stock in this offering will be approximately $85.4 million after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

    If the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full, we estimate
additional net proceeds to us from such exercise of approximately $13.1 million.

    We intend to apply the net proceeds to us from this offering in the
following order of priority:

        º first, we intend to repay $10.0 million of outstanding borrowings
          under our revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to mature on
          July 31, 2008 and which had a weighted average interest rate of
          approximately 8.3% as of September 29, 2006; and

        º second, we intend to apply the remaining net proceeds of this offering
          to repurchase or redeem $68.9 million of our outstanding 13% Senior
          Subordinated Notes due 2009, which are scheduled to mature on June 15,
          2009, and to pay related accrued interest, fees and expenses of
          $6.5 million.

    After giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds described
above, we would have had $325.7 million of total indebtedness outstanding as of
September 29, 2006."

subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions.
We will compete against other medical technology and pharmaceutical companies
who market aesthetic products. In the United States, we will compete primarily
with companies that offer temporary injectable aesthetic products approved by
the FDA for the correction of facial wrinkles, such as Medicis Pharmaceutical
Corporation and Allergan, Inc. In addition, we will compete with companies that
offer products that physicians currently use off-label for the correction of
facial wrinkles, including BioForm Medical, Inc. and Dermik Laboratories, a
subsidiary of sanofi-aventis. A number of companies, such as Mentor Corporation,
are currently developing new products that may be used for the treatment of
facial wrinkles, although we believe none of them involve a non-resorbable
injectable aesthetic implant. We also will compete with companies that offer
different treatments for facial wrinkles, including topical cosmeceuticals and
creams, chemical peels, laser skin treatments and microdermabrasion.

    To compete effectively, we will need to demonstrate that ArteFill is a
unique and attractive alternative to these other products and treatments. We
believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:

   •  safety and efficacy;                                                            
  
   •  immediate and enduring aesthetic results;                                       
  
   •  cost-effectiveness to patients and physicians;                                  
  
   •  reduced pain and recovery time before a patient can return to normal activities;
  
   •  effectiveness of marketing and distribution; and                                

   •  ability to leverage existing relationships with physicians and distributors.

    In addition, in March 2006, Allergan completed its acquisition of INAMED
Corporation. As a result of this transaction, the market for injectable
aesthetic products experienced a significant concentration of products within a
single entity with greater resources and the ability to provide an expanded
range of products and services and pricing programs. These companies and others
have developed and will continue to develop new products that compete with our
products."

——————

(1) We are in the process of constructing our new thick BOPET film production line
located in Weifang Hi & New Technology Development Zone and have entered into an
agreement with a manufacturing company located in Europe to manufacture the
required equipment for the new line.

(2) We have already begun construction of a new facility to house our new thick
BOPET film production line and we estimate that we have completed approximately
20% of the construction of this facility to date. The amount reflected above is
a portion of the amount required to complete the construction of the building.

(3) In connection with the establishment and commissioning of the new production
line, we require affiliated facilities in order to run this new production line.
These affiliated facilities include: facilities for the main production line
(slitter, main crusher, drier, and filters); electrical components (high and low
voltage tanks and transformers, electrical protection tank, and cables); public
utilities (air conditioning units, chiller, water and air pressure pumps, cool
water, wind pipe, and air filters); and other affiliated facilities and related
costs (steel core, material tank, crane carrier, test equipment, machinery and
electrical installation, and lubricating and heat conduction oils).

(4) We intend to develop the overseas markets for our products, particularly in the
US, Japan and Southeast Asia through trade fairs, seminars and advertising where
we believe it would be effective.

(5) In light of the expanded production capacity the new line will provide, we
expect that we will require additional working capital to support the higher
levels of accounts payable and receivable.

(6) In addition to the necessary working capital to support the expected growth in
our business, we expect to apply a portion of the net proceeds of this offering
for general and administrative costs associated with our business and
anticipated growth and those arising from being a public company. We may also
explore potential acquisitions of complementary companies or assets, although we
do not currently have any specific acquisition candidates.

The amount and timing of what we actually spend for these purposes may vary
significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future
revenues and cash generated by operations, our expenditures, potential changes
in strategy and the other factors we describe in “Risk Factors.”  We may find it
necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for
other purposes. Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of
proceeds include:

† the existence of presently unknown strategic opportunities or the need to take
advantage of changes in timing of our existing research, development and/or
commercial activities; and/or

† the need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase or eliminate existing
initiatives due to, among other things, changing market conditions and
competitive developments.

From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate
continuing to make such evaluations to determine if our existing allocation of
resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being optimized.
Therefore, we will have broad discretion in the way we use the net proceeds from
this offering. Pending their ultimate use, we intend to invest the net proceeds
from this offering primarily in investment grade, interest-bearing instruments."

$11.0 million in 2007 and expenditures for product development and expanding our
manufacturing, engineering, operations, marketing and sales departments. We plan
to add additional direct sales executives in regions across the United States.
In addition, we plan to use net proceeds from this offering to build our
international sales and marketing presence in Europe, Asia, Latin America and
the Middle East. However, we have not determined the amounts that we will expend
in each of these areas, as these amounts could vary significantly based on the
amount of our future revenue and market conditions.
 
Additionally, we may choose to expand our current business through acquisitions
of or investments in other complementary businesses, products or technologies.
However, we have no negotiations, agreements or commitments with respect to any
material acquisitions at this time.
 
Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a
variety of short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

stock in this offering of approximately $65.4 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders in this offering, including any shares that they may sell if the
underwriters exercise their over allotment option.

We intend to contribute all of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to
Carrols, which will use such proceeds to repay approximately $65.4 million
principal amount of term loan borrowings under the senior credit facility. As of
September 30, 2006, borrowings under the term loan bore interest at a rate of
8.0% per annum.

Affiliates of Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC,
each an underwriter in this offering, are agents and lenders under the senior
credit facility. The senior credit facility is comprised of a secured revolving
credit facility providing for aggregate borrowings of up to $50.0 million
(including $20.0 million available for letters of credit) and $220.0 million
aggregate principal amount of secured term loan borrowings. Under the senior
credit facility, the revolving credit facility expires on December 31, 2009 and
term loan borrowings mature on December 31, 2010. As of September 30, 2006,
there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility
(excluding $14.6 million reserved for outstanding letters of credit), and there
was $187.0 million principal amount of term loan borrowings outstanding. The
proceeds we received from the term loan borrowings under the senior credit
facility were applied, together with the net proceeds we received from the
issuance of the Notes, for the purposes described under “Prospectus
Summary—December 2004 Transactions.”"

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to finance a portion of the
construction costs of our Hankinson, Dyersville, Janesville and Springfield
facilities and 50% of the construction costs of our Grinnell facility at an
estimated aggregate cost of $628.7 million, with the balance of $509.8 million
expected to come from cash on hand, cash generated from operations and
borrowings under existing and committed credit facilities. The amounts and
timing of our construction expenditures will depend on numerous factors,
including the receipt of required additional funding, the federal, state and
local permitting and licensing process, the construction schedules of our
contractors, the delivery of goods and equipment by our suppliers and various
other considerations typically associated with large-scale construction
projects.

We will also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to prepay
$6.8 million of outstanding subordinated debt, including interest and prepayment
penalties, and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, working
capital and the repayment of short-term debt. The subordinated debt bears
interest at 14.50% and matures on December 19, 2016. We incurred this
subordinated debt on December 19, 2005 to pay for a portion of the construction
of our Albert City facility.

Pending any ultimate use of any portion of the proceeds from this offering, we
intend to invest the proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments,
including short-term, interest-bearing instruments such as U.S. government
securities and commercial paper."

——————
(1)Approximately $96,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration
fee, the NASD filing fee and a portion of the non-accountable expense allowance
and legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we received from our
officers and directors described below. These funds will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this
offering.

(2)For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are reflected as the
amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of the offering. An
additional $300,000, or $345,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full, all of which will be deposited in trust following the consummation of the
offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a
business combination.

(3)The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $800,000 even
if the over-allotment is exercised.

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Pantheon China
Acquisition Limited, an entity owned by Mark D. Chen, our chief executive
officer and president, and Christina Jun Mu and Kevin Kezhong Wu, each an
officer and director of ours, and Francisco A. Garcia and Hunter S. Reisner,
each a special advisor of ours, and Easton Capital Corp. Defined Benefit Plan,
the trustee of which is John H. Friedman, one of our special advsors, have
committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $1,250,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a private 
placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will 
not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the 
insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be 
placed in the trust fund described below.

$27,200,000, or $31,497,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,250,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Lehman
Brothers, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York,
New York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting
discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The
underwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we
consummate a business combination and have waived their right to receive such
payment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business
combination. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to $300,000 of
interest income that may be released to us following the one year anniversary of
the date of this prospectus, the proceeds held in trust will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business
combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be
used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
complete a business combination.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, special advisors,
stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination
(regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and
business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or
similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.
Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in
trust and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant
to the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business
combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses” and “Working
capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, taxes and reserves.”
 Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,
we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a business combination
will be approximately $800,000. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $300,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $80,000), with the balance of $220,000 being held in reserve for
tax payments and in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described above. In addition to the foregoing, interest earned on the funds in
the trust account of up to $300,000 may be released to us to fund our working
capital requirements if we have not consummated a business combination by the
one year anniversary of the date of this prospectus. Such amount would be added
to our excess working capital. We believe that the excess working capital will
be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could
use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants
to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion
of the funds not being placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop”
provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses
from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more
favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If
we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms
of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States “government
securities” so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed."

(1)  º Excludes the payment of $100 from the representative of the underwriters
     for the underwriters' purchase option, proceeds from the sale of units
     under the purchase option and proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.

(2)
   º A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds loaned to
     us by members of our management described below. These funds (all of which
     have been applied to the offering expenses incurred to date) will be repaid
     from the gross proceeds of this offering not being deposited in trust upon
     completion of this offering.

(3)  º For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are reflected as
     the amounts that are payable to the underwriters upon consummation of this
     offering. An additional $650,000, or $747,500 if the over-allotment option
     is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in trust following the
     consummation of this offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and
     when we consummate a business combination.

(4)  º The underwriting non-accountable expense allowance of $400,000, all of
     which will be deposited in trust following the consummation of this
     offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a
     business combination.

(5)  º Together, the deferred underwriting discount and the underwriting
     non-accountable expense allowance total $1,050,000, or $1,147,500 if the
     over-allotment option is exercised in full.

(6)  º We currently estimate that we would require approximately $50,000 to
     $75,000 to implement our stockholder approved plan of dissolution and
     distribution in the event we do not consummate a business transaction.

    In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our initial
stockholders—Messrs. Thomas, Culp and Creed—have committed to purchase the
insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $960,000) from us. These
purchases will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the
consummation of this offering. The purchase price of the insider warrants was
determined based on prevailing prices paid by management of Harbor Acquisition
Corp. for warrants. While we believe this price to be fair, we have not obtained
any independent third party valuation of these warrants. In addition, if and to
the extent these warrants are exercised, you may experience further dilution to
the value of your shares. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with
respect to the purchase of the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive
from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below.

    $18,575,000, or $21,432,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds, plus the $960,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 17 Battery
Place, New York, New York 10004, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of
the underwriting fees and commissions and underwriters non-accountable expense
allowance payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have
agreed that such amounts will not be paid unless and until we commence a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. Interest and other
earnings on the proceeds held in the trust account, up to a maximum of
$1,025,000, after giving effect to applicable taxes, will be released to us from
time to time for general corporate purposes. The proceeds held in the trust
account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business
with which we complete a business combination, subject to the rights of any
dissenting public stockholders to convert their stock into their pro rata share
of the funds in the trust account. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business and not returned to dissenting stockholders may
be used to finance operations of the target business or to acquire additional
businesses.

    The payment to Pacific Ocean Restaurants, Inc. (""Pacific Ocean
Restaurants""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Passport Restaurants and an
affiliate of our initial stockholders, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for certain
administrative, technology and secretarial services, as well as the use of
certain limited office space in Orlando. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Pacific Ocean Restaurants for our benefit and is not intended to provide the
initial stockholders compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the Orlando metropolitan area, that the
fee charged by Pacific Ocean Restaurants is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business 
combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay this 
monthly fee. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee payable to 
Pacific Ocean Restaurants as described above, no compensation of any kind  
(including finder's and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing 
stockholders, our officers or directors, or any of their affiliates, for 
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of the 
business combination. However, they will receive reimbursement for any 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our 
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due 
diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount 
of such reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses to officers and directors, and 
there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other 
than our Board of Directors. To the extent that such expenses exceed the 
available proceeds not deposited in the trust fund, such out-of-pocket 
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we complete a business 
combination, in which event this reimbursement obligation would in all
likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business. Because the role
of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no
ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons
after a business combination.

    We will be required by pay to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company an
initial acceptance fee of $1,000 and annual fees of $3,000 for acting as
trustee, $4,800 for acting as transfer agent for our common stock, $1,200 for
acting as transfer agent for our warrants and $1,200 for acting as escrow agent.
All of these fees will be paid from amounts not held in trust.

    We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $235,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $180,000), with
the balance of $55,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We expect that due diligence of
prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers
and directors and may include engaging law firms, accounting firms, market
research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will
not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

    It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working
capital to make a deposit, down payment or fund a ""no-shop"" provision with
respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so. We believe the net proceeds from the offering
will be sufficient to fund the evaluation, negotiation and other expenses
attendant to consummating a business combination even if we make such a payment.
However, in the event that such deposit were large enough (thereby depleting
enough of our non-trust fund assets) or in the event we were ultimately required
to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement
relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of
working capital available to conduct due diligence and pay other expenses
related to consummating the business combination or finding another suitable
business combination without securing additional financing. It is possible that
our existing stockholders could advance us the additional required funds,
thereby increasing the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses that could be
reimbursed following a business combination. If we were unable to secure
additional financing, we would most likely fail to complete a business
combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

    Messrs. Thomas, Creed and Culp, our officers and directors, have advanced to
us a total of $124,000, all of which was used to pay a portion of the expenses
of this offering referenced in the line items above as ""SEC registration fee,""
""NASD registration fee"" and ""legal and accounting fees and expenses."" The loans
bear interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum and will be payable on the earlier
of one year from the date of issuance and the completion of this offering. The
loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering out of funds not held
in the trust account.

    The net proceeds of this offering not immediately required for the purposes
set forth above will only be invested in United States ""government securities,""
defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United States having a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds (including
from the net proceeds held in the trust account) during this period may be used
to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to
compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated
professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon completion of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds, with interest and other income earned on amounts deposited in
the trust account, to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not completed during that time.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we complete. A
public stockholder will be entitled to receive distributions of interest accrued
on the trust account only after we have paid our expenses and claims by third
party creditors have been satisfied."

(1)  º Excludes the payment of $100 from the representative of the underwriters
     for the underwriters' purchase option, proceeds from the sale of units
     under the purchase option and proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.

(2)
   º A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds loaned to
     us by members of our management described below. These funds (all of which
     have been applied to the offering expenses incurred to date) will be repaid
     from the gross proceeds of this offering not being deposited in trust upon
     completion of this offering.

(3)  º For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are reflected as
     the amounts that are payable to the underwriters upon consummation of this
     offering. An additional $650,000, or $747,500 if the over-allotment option
     is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in trust following the
     consummation of this offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and
     when we consummate a business combination.

(4)  º The underwriting non-accountable expense allowance of $400,000, all of
     which will be deposited in trust following the consummation of this
     offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a
     business combination.

(5)  º Together, the deferred underwriting discount and the underwriting
     non-accountable expense allowance total $1,050,000, or $1,147,500 if the
     over-allotment option is exercised in full.

(6)  º We currently estimate that we would require approximately $50,000 to
     $75,000 to implement our stockholder approved plan of dissolution and
     distribution in the event we do not consummate a business transaction.

    In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our initial
stockholders—Messrs. Thomas, Culp and Creed—have committed to purchase the
insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $960,000) from us. These
purchases will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the
consummation of this offering. The purchase price of the insider warrants was
determined based on prevailing prices paid by management of Harbor Acquisition
Corp. for warrants. While we believe this price to be fair, we have not obtained
any independent third party valuation of these warrants. In addition, if and to
the extent these warrants are exercised, you may experience further dilution to
the value of your shares. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with
respect to the purchase of the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive
from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below.

    $18,575,000, or $21,432,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds, plus the $960,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 17 Battery
Place, New York, New York 10004, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of
the underwriting fees and commissions and underwriters non-accountable expense
allowance payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have
agreed that such amounts will not be paid unless and until we commence a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. Interest and other
earnings on the proceeds held in the trust account, up to a maximum of
$1,025,000, after giving effect to applicable taxes, will be released to us from
time to time for general corporate purposes. The proceeds held in the trust
account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business
with which we complete a business combination, subject to the rights of any
dissenting public stockholders to convert their stock into their pro rata share
of the funds in the trust account. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business and not returned to dissenting stockholders may
be used to finance operations of the target business or to acquire additional
businesses.

    The payment to Pacific Ocean Restaurants, Inc. (""Pacific Ocean
Restaurants""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Passport Restaurants and an
affiliate of our initial stockholders, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for certain
administrative, technology and secretarial services, as well as the use of
certain limited office space in Orlando. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Pacific Ocean Restaurants for our benefit and is not intended to provide the
initial stockholders compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the Orlando metropolitan area, that the
fee charged by Pacific Ocean Restaurants is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business 
combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay this 
monthly fee. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee payable to 
Pacific Ocean Restaurants as described above, no compensation of any kind  
(including finder's and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing 
stockholders, our officers or directors, or any of their affiliates, for 
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of the 
business combination. However, they will receive reimbursement for any 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our 
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due 
diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount 
of such reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses to officers and directors, and 
there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other 
than our Board of Directors. To the extent that such expenses exceed the 
available proceeds not deposited in the trust fund, such out-of-pocket 
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we complete a business 
combination, in which event this reimbursement obligation would in all
likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business. Because the role
of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no
ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons
after a business combination.

    We will be required by pay to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company an
initial acceptance fee of $1,000 and annual fees of $3,000 for acting as
trustee, $4,800 for acting as transfer agent for our common stock, $1,200 for
acting as transfer agent for our warrants and $1,200 for acting as escrow agent.
All of these fees will be paid from amounts not held in trust.

    We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $235,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $180,000), with
the balance of $55,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We expect that due diligence of
prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers
and directors and may include engaging law firms, accounting firms, market
research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will
not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

    It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working
capital to make a deposit, down payment or fund a ""no-shop"" provision with
respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so. We believe the net proceeds from the offering
will be sufficient to fund the evaluation, negotiation and other expenses
attendant to consummating a business combination even if we make such a payment.
However, in the event that such deposit were large enough (thereby depleting
enough of our non-trust fund assets) or in the event we were ultimately required
to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement
relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of
working capital available to conduct due diligence and pay other expenses
related to consummating the business combination or finding another suitable
business combination without securing additional financing. It is possible that
our existing stockholders could advance us the additional required funds,
thereby increasing the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses that could be
reimbursed following a business combination. If we were unable to secure
additional financing, we would most likely fail to complete a business
combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

    Messrs. Thomas, Creed and Culp, our officers and directors, have advanced to
us a total of $124,000, all of which was used to pay a portion of the expenses
of this offering referenced in the line items above as ""SEC registration fee,""
""NASD registration fee"" and ""legal and accounting fees and expenses."" The loans
bear interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum and will be payable on the earlier
of one year from the date of issuance and the completion of this offering. The
loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering out of funds not held
in the trust account.

    The net proceeds of this offering not immediately required for the purposes
set forth above will only be invested in United States ""government securities,""
defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United States having a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds (including
from the net proceeds held in the trust account) during this period may be used
to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to
compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated
professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon completion of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds, with interest and other income earned on amounts deposited in
the trust account, to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not completed during that time.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we complete. A
public stockholder will be entitled to receive distributions of interest accrued
on the trust account only after we have paid our expenses and claims by third
party creditors have been satisfied."

sell 3,325,950 additional shares of our common stock to the underwriters to

5,000,000 shares of common stock sold by us in the offering. Our net proceeds
from the offering represent the amount we expect to receive after paying the

payable by us.
 
We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common
stock by the selling stockholders, including any shares sold by the selling
stockholders upon exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option.
 
We intend to use approximately $38.0 million of the net proceeds from this
offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In addition,
we also expect to use approximately $10.2 million of the net proceeds to fund a
mandatory payment to the holders of our Series B convertible preferred stock in
connection with the conversion of the outstanding shares of our Series B
convertible preferred stock immediately before the completion of this offering.
 
We pursue acquisitions of other businesses as part of our business strategy and
may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund these acquisitions. We have no
agreement with respect to any acquisition, although we assess opportunities on
an ongoing basis and from time to time have discussions with other companies
about potential transactions.
 
Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
the offering. Further, changing business conditions and unforeseen circumstances
could cause the actual amounts used for these purposes to vary from our
estimates. Pending their use, we will invest the net proceeds of the offering in
short-term, interest-bearing securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds
invested will yield a favorable return."

stock in this offering will be approximately $83.1 million, or approximately
$96.0 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
based upon the initial public offering price of $25.00 per share and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses.

    We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

         •$50 million to fund Phase 3 clinical trials and long term
          carcinogenicity studies for Hematide;

         •$5 million to fund manufacturing scale-up, which involves technical
          development of large lot processes to produce commercial quantities of
          Hematide;

         •$5 million to fund pre-approval commercial development, competitive
          positioning analyses, physician education and development of a
          commercial sales and marketing organization in preparation for the
          potential commercial launch of Hematide;

         •$5 million to fund research and development relating to other product
          candidates; and

         •the remainder to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other
          general corporate purposes.

    We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the potential acquisition of,
or investment in, other product candidates, intellectual property rights or
companies that complement our business, although we have no current
understandings, commitments or agreements to do so.

    This expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering.

    The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several factors,
including the progress of our research and development efforts and the amount of
cash used by our operations. Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

    We believe that the cash received from Takeda, existing cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments and the interest thereon, will enable us
to maintain our currently planned operations through at least 24 months without
including the net proceeds from this offering. However, even with the net
proceeds from this offering, we may be required to raise additional capital to
complete the development and commercialization of Hematide."

exercise of the over-allotment option and such increased private placement will
be added to our working capital and be used for general corporate purposes,
which could include the purchase of additional aircraft and other aviation
assets, and will not increase the purchase price for our Initial Portfolio.

We will acquire our Initial Portfolio from affiliates of GE."

We expect to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering to enhance 
our current capital ratios in order to increase our deposit and loan portfolios, 
expand our operations through the opening of new branches and loan production

Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to finance acquisitions 
of other financial services companies, although we have no present plans in 
that regard. We currently plan to contribute a substantial portion of the net

any proceeds from the underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment option.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity.

At September 30, 2006, the aggregate outstanding balance under our Credit
Agreement with Merrill Lynch Capital was $61.1 million. The term loan borrowings
under this agreement mature on January 28, 2010 and January 1, 2011 for Term
Loan A and Term Loan B, respectively. The loans under the agreement bear
variable interest based on a margin over prime rate or LIBOR. As of
September 30, 2006, the applicable margins were 2.50% and 2.75% for prime rate
borrowings and 4.00% and 4.25% for LIBOR borrowings, for Term Loan A and Term
Loan B, respectively. As of September 30, 2006, Term Loan A was bearing interest
at LIBOR of 9.33% and Term Loan B was bearing interest at LIBOR of 9.58%,
respectively.

We are required by our Credit Agreement to use a portion of our net proceeds
from this offering to repay approximately $35.0 million of our outstanding
indebtedness to Merrill Lynch Capital. We intend to use the remainder of such
net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments. We believe that our net cash
provided by operating activities and existing cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next two years."

We will use approximately $9.5 million of the net proceeds of this offering to
pay the accrued and unpaid dividends to the former holders of our Series B and
Series C preferred stock upon the automatic conversion of such shares to common
stock upon the consummation of this offering.

We intend to use the remaining net proceeds of this offering for general
corporate purposes, including working capital needs. While we have not allocated
the remaining net proceeds of this offering to specified general corporate
purposes, we may utilize such proceeds by allocating them amongst the following
categories: technology infrastructure to help increase transaction volume and
further enhance our software products and develop new software solutions; the
addition of sales and marketing personnel to encourage adoption of Patient
Clinical Summaries, increase awareness of our solutions and expand our customers
within the payer markets; and development of marketing, sales and other
promotional programs to cross-sell products to our existing and future
customers. We believe opportunities may exist to expand our current business
through strategic acquisitions and investments in technology, and we may use a

create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access

this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include:

    •   expansion of our domestic and international sales and marketing

        personnel, expanding reseller and other sales relationships with

    •   further development of our product offerings, which may include increasing 
        the number of software engineering and quality assurance personnel; and    

    •   pursuit of other corporate opportunities that may arise in the future,     
        including possible acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies  
        or other assets.   

We have no ongoing negotiations or current agreements or commitments with
respect to any of the above activities. Our management may decide to change the
use of the net proceeds from this offering if opportunities or needs arise. Such
opportunities and needs could include an opportunity to invest in or acquire
another company or assets, the need to make increased capital or operating
expenditures if we change our business plan, or an unexpected liability such as
an adverse legal judgment. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in high quality, investment grade U.S. government-backed obligations.
The actual use of the proceeds may vary significantly and will depend on a
number of factors, including our future revenue and cash generated by operations
and other factors. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in 
applying the net proceeds of this offering."

significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering.

repay and terminate a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, approximately
$22.5 million of the net proceeds of this offering to fund the purchase of
secondhand double hull bunkering tankers and the remainder for working capital
and general corporate purposes, including new vessel acquisitions.

    As of June 30, 2006, our outstanding indebtedness that we expect to repay
and terminate with the net proceeds from this offering consisted of:

     (i)  Long-term credit facilities in the aggregate outstanding amount of
     $27.4 million used to finance a portion of the acquisition costs of 10
     vessels in our current fleet of 12 bunkering tankers, one Aframax tanker
     and one Panamax tanker, which have final maturity dates of between
     February 28, 2007 and July 28, 2014 and bear interest at rates ranging from
     LIBOR plus 1.25% to LIBOR plus 1.75%;

     (ii)  Long-term credit facilities in the aggregate outstanding amount of
     $1.0 million used to finance the purchase of the long term leasehold
     interest in our office in Gibraltar and the purchase of our office in the
     United States, which have final maturity dates of December 10, 2013 and
     June 24, 2015, respectively, and bear interest at the lender's base rate,
     which is defined in the agreement, plus 2.25% and at LIBOR plus 0.45%,

     (iii)  Short-term overdraft facilities in the aggregate outstanding amount
     of $8.0 million used to finance working capital requirements, which are
     payable on demand and bear interest at rates ranging from LIBOR plus 1.25%
     to LIBOR plus 2.75%;

     (iv)  Short-term loan facilities from Leveret in the aggregate outstanding
     amount of $28.1 million used to partially finance (i) the construction cost
     of new bunkering and specialty tankers, (ii) the acquisition cost of
     secondhand bunkering tankers and (iii) for working capital and general
     corporate purposes. These facilities bear no interest and are payable on
     demand; and

     (v)  A revolving overdraft facility in the outstanding amount of
     $35.0 million used to finance the acquisition of 8% of our issued and
     outstanding capital stock from Leveret, which, in turn, repurchased the 8%
     interest in Leveret held by the siblings of Mr. Melisanidis. The loan is
     payable on demand and bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.45%.

    Subsequent to June 30, 2006, we have incurred additional indebtedness that
we expect to repay and terminate with the net proceeds from this offering
including an additional short-term loan facility from Leveret in the amount of
$5.0 million, additional borrowings of $3.4 million under a new senior
syndicated term loan facility to partially finance the acquisition costs of the
Aegean Force and borrowings of $9.2 million under a new loan facility to
partially finance the acquisition costs of the Fos. We expect to enter into our 
new senior secured credit facility immediately following the completion of this 
offering. We expect to draw on our new senior secured credit facility to fund 
new acquisitions and provide working capital. Our new senior secured credit 
facility is discussed further in the section of this prospectus entitled 
""Business—New Senior Secured Credit Facility.""

    Because our use of the net proceeds from this offering depends on a number
of factors, including, among other factors, our ability to locate suitable
secondhand bunkering tankers or negotiate purchase contracts on terms acceptable
to us, our working capital requirements and incurrence of any material expenses
or liabilities, our actual use of the proceeds may vary substantially from our
current intentions."

common stock we are offering will be $59.0 million after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

    We intend to use our net proceeds to repay the outstanding amount under our
$25.0 million revolving credit facility. The maximum amount available under our
revolving credit facility, which expires on June 30, 2007, reduces to $10.0
million on January 1, 2007. Indebtedness under our revolving credit facility
bears interest at a floating rate of interest based on either the prime rate
quoted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an adjusted LIBOR rate. At October 31,
2006, the applicable interest rate under our revolving credit facility was 8.0%
per annum and the amount outstanding under such facility was approximately
$22.0 million. The borrowings under the revolving credit facility are used for
working capital purposes.

    The remainder of our net proceeds will be used for infrastructure
improvements, including expanding and upgrading our information technology
systems; hiring new employees; marketing and advertising; product development;
working capital; and other general corporate purposes. We will have broad
discretion as to how we will spend the proceeds, and you will have no advance
opportunity to evaluate, and may not agree with, the manner in which we spend
the proceeds. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common
stock offered by the selling stockholders.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to provide additional funds for
the purposes described above, to attract and retain qualified employees and
consultants by providing them with stock options and to create a public market
for our common stock for the benefit of our stockholders.

    Until such time as we have identified specific uses for the offering

to be approximately $12,398,000 (approximately $14,374,400 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), based upon an initial public
offering price of $5.00 per unit and after deducting the estimated underwriting
discount, the non-accountable expense allowance and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

    We intend to use the proceeds of this offering as follows:

    Existing and New Domestic Markets — we are currently operating in 61 markets
domestically and expect to use the proceeds of this offering to purchase
SmartVaultstm to increase sales in existing markets and potentially open 10 new
centers. The initial capital outlay for each new center is approximately
$100,000 which includes the purchases of a forklift, a trailer and approximately
30 new SmartVaultstm. Assuming we are able to successfully increase demand
within existing markets, we will need additional SmartVaultstm to serve those
areas, at an estimated cost of $2,000 per unit which includes the GPS unit and
freight for delivery.

    Sales and Marketing — consists of increasing print, internet advertising
(including fees paid for Internet leads acquired through web portals) and
marketing materials. Also includes additional personnel and support staff.

    New International Markets — we have identified up to 12 international
destinations in which a third party will handle all logistics of our
SmartVaultstm from the U.S. port to the consumer’s final international
destination. To expand into brokering international moves and to meet the sales
demands, we will need additional SmartVaultstm. However, we will not need to
incur any expense for forklift and trailer because the vault unloading and
loading will be handled by third party service providers in each respective
country. We estimate that each new international market will require an initial
capital outlay of approximately $80,000.

    Working Capital — these uses consist of software enhancements, customer
service personnel, increased administrative staff and working capital reserves.

    The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the results of our sales, marketing activities, competition
and the amount of cash generated or used by our operations. The amount and
timing of our actual expenditures may vary substantially from the foregoing
estimates. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for
other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of the
balance of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in certificates of deposit, short-term obligations of
the United States government, or other money-market instruments that are rated
investment grade or its equivalent. We currently estimate that proceeds of the
offering will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for
approximately 18 months, depending on the rate of our expansion and our ability
to achieve break-even operations."

6,300,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of approximately $9.5
million payable by us. We will use the net proceeds from this offering as
follows:

    •   an aggregate of approximately $102.5 million to purchase from PVR, in a    
        private placement, 416,444 common units and 3,610,383 Class B units        
        representing limited partner interests in PVR; and                         

    •   approximately $2.1 million to make a capital contribution to PVR to        
        maintain our 2% general partner interest.                                  

We will use the remainder of the net proceeds of this offering for general
partnership purposes.

The Class B units will be issued in lieu of additional PVR common units to
comply with the rules of the NYSE as they relate to PVR. For a description of
the terms of the Class B units, please read “Material Provisions of the
Partnership Agreement of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P.—Class B Units.”
 
If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units
from us in full, we will receive additional net proceeds of approximately $16.4
million. We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’
option to purchase additional common units, to purchase additional Class B units
from PVR and make an additional capital contribution in an amount equal to
approximately $0.3 million to PVR to maintain our 2% general partner interest.

The price we will pay per PVR common unit and Class B unit is $25.45, which is
equal to the volume weighted average market price per PVR common unit for the
ten trading days ended December 4, 2006.

PVR will use the net proceeds from the sale to us of the PVR common units and
Class B units and the related general partner contribution to repay
approximately $104.6 million of borrowings outstanding under its credit
facility. As of November 30, 2006, PVR had outstanding borrowings of $257.8
million under its credit facility. The borrowings were incurred to finance PVR’s
acquisitions. Borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at 
a rate of 6.6% per annum and are due and payable in March 2010."
