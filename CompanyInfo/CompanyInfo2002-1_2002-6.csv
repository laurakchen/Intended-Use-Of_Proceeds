deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering 

   
   •   for the expansion of sales and marketing activities,  
   
   •   for strategic relationships and acquisitions, and  
   
   •   for working capital and general corporate purposes, including continued 
enhancement of our research and development and engineering capabilities.  


      We have not yet determined the exact amounts that we will spend for any 
of these uses. We are not in any discussions regarding acquisitions. The 
amounts and purposes for which we allocate the net proceeds of this offering 
may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, including future 
revenue and the amount of cash generated by our operations. We may utilize up 
to 50% of the net proceeds of this offering in connection with our initiative 
to penetrate the iAppliance markets, which would include research and 
development, establishment of sales and marketing infrastructure, and 
potential strategic acquisitions. The actual amount, however, will depend on 
market conditions, the growth of the iAppliance markets, and our success in 
those markets. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation 
of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the uses described above, we 
will invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. 

      We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock to be sold 
by the selling stockholders if the over-allotment option is exercised."

capital and other general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions. 
On December 31, 2001, we had outstanding $51.3 million of senior subordinated 
notes, which mature on December 31, 2007 and which we may prepay at 105% of the 
principal amount. Our senior subordinated indebtedness bears interest at 12% 
per annum. Also on December 31, 2001, we had outstanding $125.8 million of 
indebtedness under our existing senior secured credit facility, which bore 
interest rates between 5.1% and 5.7% per annum and which comprises a Tranche A 
term loan, a Tranche B term loan and a revolving credit line. The Tranche A 
term loan matures on September 15, 2005, the Tranche B term loan matures on 
September 15, 2006 and the revolving credit line matures on September 29, 2005. 
We may prepay the loans under our existing senior secured credit facility at 
any time. We are currently in negotiations to replace our existing senior 
secured credit facility with a new senior secured credit facility, which will 
provide for aggregate borrowings of up to $125 million. The new senior secured 
credit facility will consist of a $40 million five-year term loan, a 
$45 million six-year term loan and a five-year $40 million revolving loan. This 
offering is not contingent upon closing the new senior secured credit facility. 
We expect the new senior secured credit facility to have customary terms and 
conditions, including requirements that we meet certain financial ratios in 
order to draw upon the facilities. If we do not close on our new senior secured 
credit facility on or before the closing of this offering, the terms of our 
existing senior secured credit facility require that the outstanding 
indebtedness thereunder be repaid before the repayment of our senior 
subordinated notes."

proceeds from the sale of the 14,500,000 shares of common stock offered by us 
will be approximately $254.4 million, or approximately $272.1 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, in each case after 
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by 
us of approximately $2.5 million. We will not receive any of the proceeds from 
the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 

        We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to: 

• 
redeem in full all outstanding shares of our 14% series A senior redeemable 
preferred stock; and 
• 
redeem in full all outstanding shares of our 12% series B junior redeemable 
preferred stock. 
        Assuming this offering occurred on February 2, 2002, the last day of 
our 2001 fiscal year, the aggregate redemption price of our 14% series A 
preferred stock and 12% series B preferred stock would be approximately 
$140.8 million and $96.7 million, respectively, which in each case includes a 
6% redemption premium and accrued and unpaid dividends through February 2, 2002. 
The actual amount we will pay to redeem these shares will also include accrued 
and unpaid dividends from February 3, 2002 to the date the offering is 
completed. 

        Any remaining net proceeds, including proceeds to be received by us if 
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, will be used for general 
corporate purposes. 

        Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend 
to invest the net proceeds in short-term investment grade securities."

the sale of 5,400,000 shares of common stock in this offering will total 
approximately $61.3 million, or $71.1 million if the underwriters exercise 
their over-allotment option in full, and after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses, which are payable by us. The 
principal purposes of this offering are to establish a public market for our 
common stock, increase our visibility in the marketplace and facilitate our 
future access to public capital markets. We intend to use the net proceeds from 
this offering as follows: 

• $10.0 to $15.0 million for collateral requirements to support the growth of 
transaction processing with outside vendors. This processing includes but is 
not limited to ATM/debit card, credit card and ACH processing. We meet these 
collateral requirements by pledging cash to provide collateral to financial 
institutions for actual or contingent liabilities arising from potential 
charge-backs, adjustments, fees, or other charges we incur; 


• $10.0 to $15.0 million for capital expenditures. Significant capital 
expenditures include, but are not limited to, networking equipment, storage 
equipment, servers, and redundant data facilities; and 


• the balance for other general corporate purposes, including continued 
international expansion and development of additional product features. 
        The amounts that we actually expend for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of 
factors, including future revenue growth, if any, and the amount of cash that 
we generate from operations. As a result, we will retain broad discretion over 
the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. We also may use a portion 
of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses, products and 
technologies. We have no current agreements or commitments for acquisitions of 
any businesses, products or technologies. Pending these uses, we will invest 
the net proceeds of this offering in short-term money market and money market 
equivalent securities."

offering expenses, we will receive net proceeds from this offering of about
$302.4 million, or about $348.0 million if the underwriters exercise their

     We intend to use $250.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering to
repay a portion of our indebtedness to Barnes & Noble. Barnes & Noble incurred
an aggregate of approximately $361.5 million of indebtedness in connection with
its acquisitions of Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 and Funco in June 2000. Since
the acquisitions, Barnes & Noble has continued to fund our business operations
and these amounts have been treated as an intercompany loan owed to Barnes &
Noble by us. Immediately prior to the closing of this offering, Barnes & Noble
will contribute the difference between the aggregate amount of the intercompany
loan balance and $250.0 million as additional paid-in capital. We expect the
amount of the capital contribution to be approximately $150.0 million as of the
closing of this offering.
 
     We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds, including amounts we may
receive from the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, for
working capital and general corporate purposes. Our management will have broad
discretion over the use of this balance. Pending these uses, we may invest this
balance temporarily in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities
or guaranteed obligations of the United States government."

preferred securities in the convertible debentures. We anticipate that the net
proceeds to us from the sale of the convertible debentures will be approximately
$13.9 million after deducting offering expenses and underwriting
commissions, estimated to be $1.1 million.

      We intend to infuse approximately ninety percent (90%) of the net proceeds
from the sale of the convertible debentures into our bank subsidiary, Southern
Community Bank and Trust, as regulatory capital to fund its operations and its
continued expansion, and the operation and continued expansion of the bank's
subsidiaries, and to maintain the bank's status as a ""well capitalized"" bank
under the guidelines of its regulators. We may use the remaining portions of the
net proceeds for our general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to,
the possible repurchase of shares of our common stock and acquisitions of or
investments in the bank or permissible non-bank entities by either us or the
bank (although no agreements or understandings presently exist with respect to
any such acquisition). Before we apply any of the proceeds for any of these
uses, they likely will be temporarily invested in short-term investment
securities. The precise amounts and timing of the application of proceeds will
depend upon our funding requirements, the funding and capital requirements of
our bank subsidiary, and whether we have funds available from other sources that
we can use for any of those purposes. The Federal Reserve Board's risk-based
capital guidelines currently allow us to count the proceeds of the convertible
preferred securities as Tier 1 capital on our books. However, the amount of
proceeds we count cannot be more than 25% of our total Tier 1 capital. Amounts
in excess of that 25% limitation will count as Tier 2 supplementary capital on
our books. We expect to be able to count substantially all the proceeds from the
sale of the convertible preferred securities as Tier 1 capital."

$100.3 million, based on an offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting
the estimated expenses related to this offering and the portion of the
underwriting discount payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds we
receive to pay off all of the principal and accrued interest then outstanding
under our term loan and under our subordinated debt and to pay off all but
$25.0 million of principal owing under our revolving credit facility. The
amounts outstanding under these borrowings fluctuate from time to time, but as
of December 31, 2001, the principal and accrued interest under our term loan
was approximately $5.9 million, principal and accrued interest under our
subordinated debt was approximately $8.0 million, and principal and accrued
interest under our revolving credit facility was approximately $57.3 million.
The term loan, revolving credit facility and subordinated debt agreements
mature on December 31, 2004 and accrue interest at per annum rates of prime
plus 1.25% (6.0% at December 31, 2001), prime plus 0.75% (5.5% at December 31,
2001) and 12.0%, respectively. We incurred the indebtedness under the term loan
and the revolving credit facility in December 2001 and used the net proceeds of
this indebtedness to pay off our prior term loan and revolving credit facility.

    We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds of this offering
(together with cash on hand, additional borrowings and capital stock) to fund
all or a portion of the costs of any acquisitions of complementary businesses
we determine to pursue in the future, although there are no assurances that we
will be able to successfully identify or consummate any such acquisitions. To
the extent that we do not pursue or consummate any acquisitions, any remaining
net proceeds to us will be used for working capital and general corporate
purposes. We have no present commitments, agreements or understandings to
acquire any business. We may invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities or guaranteed
obligations of the United States or its agencies. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of the shares to be sold by the selling stockholder in
this offering or under the over-allotment option."

exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately
$126.7 million.
 
   The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working
capital, establish a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
future access to public markets. Although we currently have no specific plans
for the application of a significant portion of the net proceeds of this
offering, we expect to use these net proceeds for:
 
  .  clinical and preclinical development of existing product candidates;
 
  .  discovery and development of additional product opportunities;
 
  .  hiring of development, research and administrative personnel;
 
  .  capital expenditures such as the construction of a pilot manufacturing
     plant and the expansion of our existing facilities; and
 
  .  working capital and other general corporate purposes.
 
If the opportunity arises, we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to
acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that are
complementary to our own. Although we periodically engage in preliminary
discussions with respect to acquisitions, we are not currently a party to any
agreements or commitments and we have no understandings with respect to any
acquisitions.
 
   The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on several factors,
including the progress of our research and development efforts and the amount
of cash used by our operations. We have not determined the amount or timing of
the expenditures in the areas listed above. Pending their use, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing

(a)     As of the date of this prospectus, we owed $66.7 million under our 
existing senior credit facility. We expect to repay this facility in full with 
$26.7 million of the proceeds of this offering and $40.0 million from our new 
senior credit facility while incurring $2.1 million in fees on our new facility, 
described below under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources 
— New Senior Credit Facility” and $2.8 million to terminate our existing 
interest rate swap agreements. The outstanding loans under our existing senior 
credit facility mature between March 2005 and March 2007 and presently bear 
interest at rates ranging from 5.4% to 6.9% per year.  
(b)     The senior subordinated notes mature in 2009, but we will prepay the 
notes in full, together with a redemption premium of $1.4 million, with the 
proceeds from this offering, as further discussed below under the caption 
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Senior Subordinated Notes.”  
(c)     Our Series E preferred stock and Series F preferred stock were issued 
in connection with our acquisition of HV Technologies in January 2002. The 
Series E preferred stock was issued to investors for cash that was paid to 
shareholders of HV Technologies, and the Series F preferred stock was issued to 
one of the shareholders of HV Technologies. Our Series E preferred stock and 
our Series F preferred stock accrue dividends at the rate of 6% per year until 
December 31, 2002 and January 4, 2003, respectively, and accrue dividends at 
16% per year on a retroactive basis thereafter. We expect to use a portion of 
the proceeds of this offering to redeem our Series E preferred stock before 
December 31, 2002, and we will use a portion of the proceeds of this offering 
to redeem our Series F preferred stock within 45 days after we complete this 
offering.  
(d)     This amount represents payment of accrued and unpaid dividends on our 
Series B preferred stock as of the date of this prospectus, which accrues 
dividends at the rate of 6% per year. As discussed above under the first 
paragraph after the table under the caption “Prospectus Summary — 
The Offering,” the Series B preferred stock will convert into common stock upon 
completion of this offering.  
(e)     This amount represents amounts payable to terminate agreements with 
Kidd & Company and Whitney Mezzanine Management Company, together with accrued 
and unpaid fees thereunder, all described below under the caption “Related 
Party Transactions — Certain Services Provided to Us by Related Parties.”  
(f)     From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate 
possible acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, products and 
technologies that are complementary to our business. We currently have no 
arrangements, agreements or understandings for any such acquisitions or 
investments.  
  
We will pay an aggregate of $26.1 million of the proceeds of this offering to 
related parties, as further described below under the caption “Related Party 
Transactions.” 
  
The amounts and timing of our use of the proceeds of this offering will depend 
upon numerous factors, including the amount of proceeds actually raised in this 
offering, the timing of any acquisitions we complete, the availability of debt 
financing and the amount of cash generated by our operations. Until used as 
described above, we intend to invest the proceeds of this offering in 
short-term, investment-grade securities. 
  
The above description represents our present intentions based on our current 
plans and business conditions. Unforeseen events or changed business conditions, 
however, could result in the application of the net proceeds from this offering 
in a manner other than as described in this prospectus. Our management will 
have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this offering."

ranging from 2.0% to 3.0%. The net proceeds from the sale of 69,750,000 common
shares in this offering will be approximately $2.19 billion, or approximately
$2.41 billion if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full.

We will use approximately $100 million of these net proceeds to fully repay all

interest at a variable rate, which was 7.06% at December 31, 2001. This loan

indebtedness under a senior unsecured credit facility with Fleet and other 
financial institutions. This $425 million senior unsecured credit facility

quarterly. Amounts outstanding under our senior unsecured notes, including
accrued interest, are due in October 2009. See ""Certain Transactions"" for more
information on our senior unsecured notes. All of our outstanding senior
unsecured notes are held by our stockholders and several of our employees,
including our executive officers.
 
    Repay an aggregate of approximately $73.6 million of outstanding term loans
under our senior credit facility. We entered into our senior credit facility in
connection with our recapitalization and borrowed an aggregate of approximately
$105 million in connection with the recapitalization. See ""Certain
Transactions,"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources"" for more information
on our senior credit facility. Upon making these debt payments, we will have
approximately $37.6 million of outstanding indebtedness remaining under our
senior credit facility. Borrowings under our senior credit facility bear
interest at either a prime rate-based rate or Eurodollar-based rate plus the
applicable percentage, as defined. As of December 30, 2001, Tranche A term loans
and revolving loans under our senior credit facility in the aggregate principal
amount of $55 million mature in 2006 and Tranche B term loans in the aggregate
principal amount of $60 million mature in 2007. Proceeds from our senior
facility were used to prepay approximately $83 million on our existing credit
facility, representing all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest in
respect of that facility, and to fund the payment of merger consideration in
connection with the recapitalization. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis

be inaccurate, we may undertake new programs or activities that will require 
considerable additional expenditures, or unforeseen expenses may occur. We 
cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available to us on 
acceptable terms, or at all. 

From time to time we evaluate potential opportunities for acquisitions of 
complementary businesses, including other broker dealers, but we cannot assure 
you that we will complete any particular acquisition. We have no present 
commitment or agreement with respect to a material acquisition of another 
business. 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be used 
to fund client margin balances, and any remaining proceeds will be invested 
principally in United States government securities, short-term certificates of 
deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest-bearing investments."

sold in the offering, which in turn will depend on RP Financial's appraisal as
well as regulatory and market considerations, and the expenses incurred in
connection with the offering. Although we will not be able to determine the
actual net proceeds from the sale of the common stock until we complete the
offering, we estimate the net proceeds to be between $39.5 million and $53.9
million, or $62.1 million if the offering is increased by 15%.

     Partners Trust Financial Group intends to distribute the net proceeds from
the offering as follows:

     The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the
reorganization may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses
would increase if a syndicated community offering is used to sell shares not
purchased in the subscription offering and community offering. The net proceeds
will also vary if the number of shares to be sold in the offering is adjusted to
reflect a change in the estimated pro forma market value of Partners Trust
Financial Group and SBU Bank or if our ESOP purchases shares in the open market
at an average cost that is higher or lower than $10.00 per share. Payments for
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result
in the receipt of new funds for investment but will result in a reduction of SBU
Bank's deposits.

     We are undertaking the reorganization and offering at this time in order to
have the capital resources available to expand and diversify our business. For
further information, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Management Strategy."" The offering
proceeds will increase our capital and the amount of funds available to us for
lending and investment. The proceeds will also give us greater flexibility to
diversify operations and expand the products and services we offer.

Partners Trust Financial Group may use the proceeds it retains from the
offering:

     .    to finance the expansion of its operations through the acquisition of
          financial institutions or their assets, or through diversification
          into related financial services businesses, such as insurance agency,
          financial planning and investment management companies, although no
          transactions are specifically being considered at this time;

     .    to pay dividends to stockholders;

     .    to invest in securities; and

     .    for general corporate purposes.

     Following the reorganization, we may also implement stock repurchase
programs. However, under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we
may not repurchase shares of common stock during the first year following the
reorganization, except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior
regulatory approval.

SBU Bank may use the proceeds it receives from the offering:

     .    to fund new loans, including residential and commercial mortgage
          loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans;

     .    to expand its retail banking franchise, by establishing or acquiring
          new branches or by acquiring other financial institutions, or other
          financial services companies, although no transactions are
          specifically being considered at this time;

     .    to invest in securities; and

     .    for general corporate purposes."

of common stock in this offering will be approximately $25.2 million, based on 
the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share and after deducting the 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us, or $30.8 million if the underwriters' over-allotment 
option is exercised in full. 

        The principal purpose of this offering is to create a public market for 
our common stock. We intend to use approximately $3.0 million of the net 
proceeds of this offering to repay, in full, all outstanding indebtedness under 
a line of credit, to High Meadows Finance L.C., which matures on June 1, 2002 
and bears a per annum interest rate equal to 3.5% plus the rate of interest 
announced from time to time by Wells Fargo Bank & Company (or any successor 
bank thereto) as its ""Prime Rate"". High Meadows Finance L.C. is owned by High 
Plains Investments, LLC, an entity controlled by Patrick M. Byrne, our 
President and Chief Executive Officer; John J. Byrne Jr., a member of our Board 
of Directors and the father of Patrick M. Byrne; and Cirque Properties, Inc., 
an entity owned by John J. Byrne, III, the brother of Patrick M. Byrne. We 
expect to use the balance of the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

• An estimated $3 million to $6 million for expansion of our marketing and 
sales activity; 


• An estimated $1 to $2 million for capital expenditures; and 


• The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for opportunistic inventory 
purchases as well as general corporate purposes and working capital. In 
addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary 
technologies or businesses. However, we currently have no commitments or 
agreements and are not involved in any negotiations with respect to any such 
transactions. 

The amounts we actually expend for working capital and other general corporate 
purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including 
future revenue growth, if any, and the amount of cash that we generate from 
operations. As a result, we will retain broad discretion over the allocation 
of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses listed above, we intend 
to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested 
will yield a favorable return."

the repurchase of our common stock, the repayment of our debt and investments

class A common stock sold by us in this offering will be approximately 
$82.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and

We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay 
remaining outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. We borrowed 
$19.3 million which we used to fund our February 28, 2002 payment of deferred 
federal and state income taxes plus accrued interest, as discussed in more 
detail under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations—Commitments and Contingencies—Internal Revenue Service 
Audit Resolution.” As of March 31, 2002, the outstanding borrowings under our 
credit facility were $23.2 million. We used the proceeds from our sale of 
shares to an investment group in April 2002 to repay $10.0 million of these 
borrowings, and we expect the remaining principal balance, together with 
accumulated interest, will total approximately $10.0 million at the time of the 
closing of this offering. These borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.45%, 
resulting in a rate of approximately 3.32% as of May 6, 2002.  
  
We will use the remainder of the net proceeds of this offering for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We may 
also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, products, or 
technologies that are complementary to our business, however we currently have 
no specific acquisitions planned. Pending their use, we plan to invest the net

to provide us with flexibility in the future, including to acquire additional 
businesses, products or technologies either with the net proceeds from this 
offering or through the publicly traded common stock we create through this

proceeds of this offering to repay all outstanding indebtedness under our 
subordinated promissory notes, which was approximately $14.1 million as of 
May 22, 2002, including accrued interest, and for general corporate purposes, 
including working capital. Our subordinated promissory notes, issued in July 
2001, accrue interest at a stated rate of 10% per year compounded annually and

our operations. Other than the repayment of indebtedness to Hexal AG, we have
not determined the amounts we plan to spend on any of the areas listed above or

to improve our access to capital and to provide us with greater flexibility in
pursuing our strategic objectives.
 
    The outstanding indebtedness to Hexal AG to be repaid with a portion of the
proceeds of this offering is equal to approximately $66.9 million. The repayment
of such amount represents payment in full of all principal and accrued interest

2000, between Hexal AG and HPI, an entity which will be merged into us prior to
this offering. The loan has an interest rate of 8.75% and becomes due and

We have been an S corporation since 1986. Generally speaking, as an 
S corporation we have not paid income tax. Instead, our earnings have been 
passed through directly to our stockholders, who report the earnings on their 
individual tax returns. Our stockholders have been required to include in their 
taxable income their proportionate share of our earnings even if we did not 
distribute the earnings to them. Upon consummation of this offering, our 
S corporation election will terminate, and we will then become subject to 
federal and state income taxes. In connection with the termination of our 
S corporation election, we will use a portion of the net proceeds of this 
offering to fund a distribution to our current stockholders of previously taxed 
S corporation income through the date of termination. As of March 31, 2002, 
that amount was $13.5 million. Purchasers of shares of common stock in this 
offering will not be entitled to any portion of that distribution.

     There may be changes in our proposed use of proceeds due to changes in our
business and in market conditions. Pending the uses described above, we will
invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing accounts, or short-term,
interest-bearing securities, or both. We believe the proceeds from the offering,
together with our revenue, will be sufficient to sustain our activities for at
least 12 months following the offering."

of 1,875,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 after
deducting estimated offering expenses and underwriting discounts and

by the selling stockholders, nor can we participate in the sale of additional
shares relating to the underwriters' over-allotment option, if exercised.
 
     The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital,
create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to
public securities markets.
 
     Approximately $9,617,000 of the net proceeds received by us from this
offering will be used to redeem all of our outstanding shares of 12 1/2% Series

by Comverse Technology. This bank debt bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 
0.55%, matures in February 2003 and may be prepaid without penalty at the end 
of any interest period. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for 
acquisitions or other investments. However, we have no present understanding or 
agreement relating to any specific acquisition or investment.

• $240.6 million to repay principal owed by United Artists under its term credit

      We expect to use all of the net proceeds from this offering to repay 
short-term borrowings from banks. At April 16, 2002, we had approximately 
$68.6 million of short-term borrowings outstanding under arrangements with 
banks. We borrow from banks on a demand basis in the normal course of business 
to facilitate customer and firm borrowings. We use firm borrowings to finance 
securities trades. Amounts outstanding under these arrangements are 
collateralized by securities owned by us or by our customers. Interest is 
payable on amounts outstanding at floating rates that are indexed to the Fed 
Funds rate. At April 16, 2002, our weighted average interest rate on these 
borrowings approximated 2.35%. 

      Following the repayment of short-term borrowings, we expect to utilize 
cash flows from operations and other sources to support continued growth of our 
existing subsidiaries, for general corporate purposes, to repurchase shares of 
our common stock, to repay up to $10.0 million principal amount of long-term 
indebtedness due 2004 payable to Western and Southern Life Insurance Company, 
a significant stockholder, bearing interest of 8.00% per annum, and to finance

between $20 and $30 million of 
the net proceeds from this offering to increase the capital and surplus of our 
life insurance subsidiary in order to improve its capital adequacy as evaluated

principal and interest under our existing bank credit facilities and to use the
remainder of the net proceeds to repay a portion of the indebtedness under our
10% unsecured subordinated loan stock due 2008, substantially all of which is
held by our controlling stockholders.
 
     The amount of bank debt to be repaid out of the offering proceeds is
approximately $89.5 million (including accrued interest) at the exchange rate of
L1 = $1.5288 prevailing on June 27, 2002. The bank debt was used (i) to
refinance previously existing indebtedness (ii) to finance the acquisition of
ClinTrials in April 2001 and (iii) for general working capital purposes. As of
the date of this prospectus, $68.6 million principal amount of the bank debt
bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% and the balance bears interest at LIBOR plus
2.75%. All of this bank debt is repayable in installments through December 31,
2008.
 
     We intend that at the completion of this offering we will repay all of the
indebtedness under our 10% unsecured subordinated loan stock due 2008, using the
net offering proceeds that remain after repaying our bank debt (approximately

unsecured subordinated loan stock due 2008 is held by Candover Investments PLC

common stock. See ""Principal Stockholders"" and ""Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions."" Our indebtedness under the loan stock, which as of the
date of this prospectus had an outstanding principal balance of $109.7 million
plus accrued interest of $21.1 million, was incurred in two borrowings. We
borrowed $43.8 million in September 1999 in connection with our management
buyout from SGS Societe Generale de Surveillance SA. We borrowed an additional
$64.8 million to finance part of our cost of acquiring ClinTrials. All of this
indebtedness accrues interest at 10% per year and is due and payable in full no

$38.1 million after deducting the estimated expenses related to this offering 
and the portion of the underwriting discount payable by us. We intend to use 
the net proceeds we receive to pay off all of the principal and accrued 
interest then outstanding under our credit facility. On March 31, 2002, that 
amount was approximately $16.1 million, approximately $4.8 million of which was 
under a term loan and approximately $11.3 million of which was under revolving 
loans. Our term loan matures on October 1, 2005 and incurs interest at either 
the prime rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate plus a margin. As of March 
31, 2002, interest on the term loan was based on the prime rate with a margin 
of 0.5%. Our revolving loans mature on January 2, 2004 and accrue interest at 
either the prime rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate, at our election, 
plus a margin based upon our debt to earnings ratio. As of March 31, 2002, 
interest on our revolving loans was based on the prime rate plus 0.25%. Both 
margins are based on the ratio of our funded indebtedness to our adjusted 
earnings. The weighted average interest rate applicable to all borrowings under 
our credit facility was 5.1% on March 31, 2002. We incurred the indebtedness 
under our credit facility in December 2001 and used the net proceeds of this 
indebtedness to pay off our prior credit facility, which was similar to the 
revolving portion of our present facility, and to fund working capital.

general corporate purposes, including all or a portion of the costs of any 
acquisitions of complementary businesses we decide to selectively pursue in the

securities and common securities to purchase junior subordinated debentures from
us. We anticipate that the net proceeds from the sale of the junior subordinated
debentures  will be  approximately  $22.0 million,  after  deduction of offering
expenses estimated at $212,000 and underwriting commissions.

         We  intend  to use  the  net  proceeds  from  the  sale  of the  junior
subordinated  debentures  to fund the  redemption  of the  preferred  securities
issued by GCB Capital  Trust in 1997. In May 1997,  we  established  GCB Capital
Trust which issued $23.0 million of 10.00% cumulative trust preferred securities
scheduled  to mature in 2027.  That trust  invested  the proceeds of the sale of
these securities in 10.00% junior subordinated  debentures issued by us. We used
these  proceeds for general  corporate  purposes and to fund our  acquisition of
First Savings Bancorp of Little Falls,  Inc. The trust  preferred  securities of
that  trust can be  prepaid  in whole or in part on or after  June 30 ,2002 at a
redemption  price equal to the par value of each security plus  accumulated  but
unpaid  distributions  thereon  to the date of  redemption.  We intend to redeem
these junior subordinated  debentures on or after June 30, 2002. We are seeking,
and expect to receive the approval of, the Federal  Reserve Board to redeem such
debentures.  In connection with such redemption,  GCB Capital Trust would redeem
the outstanding preferred securities issued in 1997."

   Ÿ  approximately $50 million to repay indebtedness under our unsecured line 
of credit incurred after March 31, 2002, of which $24 million was incurred to 
pay the liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of the benefits 
consulting business of Bacon & Woodrow and the remainder was incurred for 
short-term working capital purposes;  

  
   Ÿ  approximately $6 million for tax liabilities incurred in connection with 
a mandatory change in tax accounting method due to our transition to a 
corporate structure; and  

  
   Ÿ  the balance for working capital and general corporate purposes.  

  
Indebtedness under our unsecured line of credit has a maturity of August 30, 
2002 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 42 to 75 basis points or at the prime 
rate at our option.

of the offering. Pending specific application of the net proceeds, we plan to 
invest the remaining net proceeds in short-term, investment grade, marketable

6,463,343 shares at the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share. If 
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we expect our 
net proceeds to be approximately $84.6 million. 

      We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, in addition to 
drawing upon our credit facility in the approximate amount of $25.8 million, to: 

   
   •   redeem in full all of our 13.45% senior discount notes due 2008 for an 
aggregate redemption price of approximately $27.5 million;  
   
   •   redeem in full all outstanding shares of our redeemable Series A 13.45%

following paragraph; and

employees at the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share without 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, for an aggregate price of

Preferred Stock, agreed to reduce the redemption price that would otherwise 
have been applicable to the redemption of our Series A preferred stock

us to pay bonuses to our directors and executive officers in an amount equal to 
the discounts and commissions on the shares they sell directly or through 
family trusts or partnerships in this offering (approximately $1.4 million if 
the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option), as well as to 
repurchase shares from our other non-executive employees as described above at 
the offering price to the public, rather than the net price to us after 
deducting underwriting commissions and discounts. Pending application of the 
net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term investment grade or money market securities.

of common stock that we are offering will be approximately $155.7 million based 
on the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that we 
will receive net proceeds of approximately $172.2 million from the sale of 
11,048,000 shares. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by 
selling stockholders. 

      We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

   
   •   approximately $37.0 million to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 
credit facility;  
   
   •   approximately $35.0 million to expand our manufacturing facilities, grow 
our PETNet distribution network, and purchase capital equipment;  
   
   •   approximately $10.2 million to redeem all outstanding shares of our 
Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, including accrued and unpaid dividends; 
and  
   
   •   approximately $0.4 million to repurchase 1,191,965 shares of our 
outstanding common stock.  


      The remaining proceeds of approximately $73.1 million will be used for 
general corporate purposes. The amounts that we actually expend for these 
specified purposes may vary significantly depending on a number of factors, 
including changes in our business strategy, the amount of our future revenues 
and expenses, and our future cash flow. For example, if our future revenues or 
cash flow are less than we currently anticipate, we may need to support our 
ongoing business operations with proceeds of this offering that we would 
otherwise use to support growth and expansion. As a result, we will retain 
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering and may 
spend such proceeds for any purpose, including purposes not presently 
contemplated. 

      Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above purposes, we 
intend to invest the funds in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing 
securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a 
favorable return. We may also temporarily repay other outstanding borrowings 
under our credit facility. 

      Our credit facility matures on March 14, 2004. Interest on outstanding 
borrowings under our credit facility accrues at a variable rate. As of March 31, 
2002, the interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facility was 
3.7%. The outstanding amount under our credit facility was used to refinance 
debt originally incurred to fund growth in working capital, such as increases 
in inventory and accounts receivable. The redemption date for our Series A 
Redeemable Preferred Stock is September 30, 2006. Our Series A Redeemable 
Preferred Stock accrues dividends at an annual rate of 9.0%. 

      An affiliate of Banc of America Securities LLC, one of the underwriters 
of this offering, is a lender under our credit facility with a 22.2% 
participation in the facility. Therefore, that affiliate will receive a 
corresponding percentage of any proceeds from this offering used to repay 
indebtedness under our credit facility."

shares of common stock offered by us in this offering, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, our net proceeds will
be approximately $37.5 million.
 
We currently intend to use approximately $22.2 million of the net proceeds of
this offering for repayment of outstanding debt, deferred interest, and a
prepayment fee as indicated below. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds
for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We have not yet
allocated any other specific amount of the net proceeds of this offering. We may
also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to acquire or invest
in businesses, technologies, or products that we believe to be complementary to
our business. We currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any
acquisitions. Our management retains broad discretion to use the net proceeds as
necessary to address our future business needs. Pending use of the net proceeds
as described above, we intend to invest these funds in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment grade securities.
 
In connection with the acquisitions we completed from October 1999 through April
2000, we incurred $68.0 million in debt. In December 2001, as part of a debt and
equity financing we repaid $27.6 million of this debt and modified the payment
terms of $12.0 million of this debt. As of April 30, 2002, we had total
outstanding debt of $38.8 million. Following the completion of this offering, we
expect to have $20.8 million in outstanding debt. The outstanding indebtedness,
deferred interest, and prepayment fee that we intend to pay with a portion of
the net proceeds of this offering, the interest rates as of April 30, 2002, and
the maturity dates with respect to such debt are summarized in the following

Stock offered in this offering (after deducting the underwriting discount and
commissions and estimated expenses of the offering) are estimated to be
approximately $10,814,000 ($12,510,500 if the underwriter's over-allotment
option is exercised in full), based upon an offering price of $25.00 per share.
 
     We are conducting this offering primarily to strengthen our regulatory
capital position and will use the proceeds for corporate and working capital
purposes. We may also invest in new business ventures or acquire other
companies. However, we are not presently in discussions regarding any such
investment or acquisition. We may also use the proceeds to pay principal and/or

preferred stock dividends, repurchase outstanding shares of common stock and for
other general corporate purposes.

offering based upon the current status of our business operations, our current
plans and current economic conditions. A change in the use of proceeds or timing
of such use will be at our discretion. Pending their longer-term use, we

million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
expenses of the offering. We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this
offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreement plus
accrued interest of $0.2 million as follows:

    .  $39.5 million will be used to repay the outstanding principal amount of
       the $40 million term loan described below,

    .  $24.0 million will be used to repay a portion of the $135 million term
       loan described below, and

    .  $63.3 million will be used to repay outstanding borrowings under the
       revolving credit facility.

   At April 5, 2002, outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement totaled
approximately $238.1 million, consisting of:

    .  $170.9 million of term loans which represents the outstanding portions
       of the $135 million term loan incurred in May 1999 to finance a portion
       of our recapitalization and acquisition of Pacer Logistics and the $40
       million term loan incurred in December 2000 to finance a portion of our
       acquisition of Rail Van. These term loans currently bear interest at the
       rate of 4.9% per annum and mature on May 28, 2006.

    .  $67.2 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility incurred
       to finance our acquisitions of Conex, GTS, RFI and Rail Van in January,
       August, October and December 2000, respectively. Borrowings under the
       revolving credit facility currently bear interest at the rate of 4.4%
       per annum and mature on May 28, 2004.

   The reduction in indebtedness under our revolving credit facility as a
result of the application of a portion of the net proceeds of this offering as
described above will enhance our ability to make acquisitions and investments
to expand our current product offerings and acquisitions of or investments in,
companies, products, technologies and processes. We currently have no
commitments or agreements with respect to any future acquisitions or
investments. However, we evaluate acquisition opportunities on an on-going
basis.

   We will not receive any proceeds for the sale of our common stock by the
selling stockholders, including if the underwriters exercise the over-allotment
option. In the aggregate, the selling stockholders and their affiliates will
receive approximately $101.9 million of the net proceeds of this offering
($131.2 million if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in
full), including $66.3 million of net proceeds received by them from the sale
of their common stock in this offering ($95.6 million if the underwriters
over-allotment option is exercised in full), and after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions, and approximately $35.6 million representing their
pro rata portion of the repayments under our credit facility."

upon the initial public offering price of $8.50 per share, after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
   The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
facilitate future access by us to public equity markets and to provide
increased visibility and credibility in the marketplace. We intend to use the
net proceeds of this offering for working capital and other general corporate
purposes including research and development activities, such as developing and
marketing enhancements to the Plumtree Corporate Portal as well as new products
and services that expand its functionality. We may also use a portion of the
net proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies or businesses. We
currently, however, have no commitments or agreements relating to any such
acquisition transactions.
 
   Based on our current business model, we expect that over a period of time we
will spend between $8 million to $12 million of the net proceeds of this
offering on sales and marketing, between $10 million to $16 million on research
and development, and between $6 million to $10 million on general and
administrative costs. These figures are subject to change, however, depending
upon our rate of revenue growth, overall financial performance and evolving
business needs. These expectations may prove to be inaccurate, as our financial
performance may differ from our current expectations or our business needs may
change as our business model and the industry we address evolve. As a result,
the proceeds we receive from this offering may be used in a manner different
from our current allocation plans.
 
   Our management retains broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds of
this offering. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. Pending use of the
net proceeds as discussed above, we intend to invest these funds in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment-grade obligations."

stock sold in the offering, which in turn will depend on FinPro's appraisal,
regulatory and market considerations, and the expenses incurred in connection
with the offering. Although we will not be able to determine the actual net
proceeds from the sale of the common stock until we complete the offering, we
estimate the net proceeds to be between $5.4 million and $7.5 million, or $8.7
million if the offering is increased by 15%. We will retain approximately 20% of
the net proceeds and contribute approximately 80% to Enfield Federal.

         New England Bancshares intends to distribute the proceeds from the

         The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the
reorganization may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses
would increase if a syndicated community offering is used to sell shares not
purchased in the subscription offering and community offering. The net proceeds
will also vary if the number of shares to be sold in the offering are adjusted
to reflect a change in the estimated pro forma market value of New England
Bancshares and Enfield Federal or if our ESOP purchases shares in the open
market at an average cost that is higher or lower than $10.00 per share.
Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will
not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by Enfield Federal but
will result in a reduction of Enfield Federal's deposits and interest expense as
funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates of deposit or other
deposit accounts.

         We may use the proceeds we retain from the offering:

         (1)   to invest in securities;

         (2)   to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions,
               although we have no current plans to do so;

         (3)   to pay dividends to stockholders; and

         (4)   for general corporate purposes.

         Following the reorganization, we may also implement stock repurchase
programs. Our ability to repurchase our common stock will be subject to
regulatory restrictions.

         Enfield Federal may use the proceeds it receives from the offering:

         (1)   to fund new loans;

         (2)   to establish or acquire new branches in its targeted market area;
               however, except for its plan to open two new branch offices in
               its market area, Enfield Federal does not have any current
               agreements or arrangements for the expansion of its business
               either through the acquisition of branch offices or the
               acquisition of or merger with other financial institutions;

         (3)    to diversify the products that it offers;

         (4)    to invest in securities; and

         (5)    for general corporate purposes.

                         OUR POLICY REGARDING DIVIDENDS

         Following completion of the reorganization, our Board of Directors will
have the authority to declare dividends on our common stock, subject to
statutory and regulatory requirements. In the future, our Board intends to
consider a policy of paying cash or stock dividends on the common stock.
However, no decision has been made with respect to the payment of dividends.
Declarations of dividends by the Board of Directors, if any, will depend upon
our debt and equity structure, earnings and financial condition, need for
capital in connection with possible future expansion opportunities and other
factors, including economic conditions, regulatory restrictions and tax
considerations. We cannot guarantee that we will pay dividends or, if we pay
dividends, the amount and frequency of these dividends.

         If we pay dividends to our stockholders, we will be required to pay
dividends to Enfield Mutual Holding Company, unless Enfield Mutual Holding
Company elects to waive dividends. We currently anticipate that Enfield Mutual
Holding Company will waive dividends paid by us. Any decision to waive dividends
will be subject to regulatory approval. See ""Regulation of Enfield Federal, New
England Bancshares and Enfield Mutual Holding Company-Dividend Waivers by
Enfield Mutual Holding Company.""

         We will not be subject to OTS regulatory restrictions on the payment of
dividends. The source of payment of any dividends paid will initially come from
proceeds retained by us in the offering. Our ability to pay dividends will also
depend on how much of our common stock we may repurchase and upon the amount of
funds available from Enfield Federal, which must provide the OTS with 30 days'
notice of its intention to make a capital distribution to us. OTS regulations
may also limit, in certain circumstances, Enfield Federal's ability to make
capital distributions. See ""Regulation of Enfield Federal, New England
Bancshares and Enfield Mutual Holding Company-Federal Banking
Regulation-Limitations on Capital Distributions."" In addition, Enfield Federal
and New England Bancshares have committed to the Office of Thrift Supervision
that during the one-year period following the completion of the reorganization,
New England Bancshares will not make any distribution to shareholders that, for
federal tax purposes, would be treated as a return of capital, without the prior
approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision."
