The Company intends to use approximately $54.4 million of the net proceeds of 
the Offerings to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit 
Facility. It is anticipated that the remaining $54.4 million will be used to 
fund capital expenditures or future acquistions. The expected capital 
expenditures will be used for machinery and equipment necessary to support the 
GMT-800 Program, construction of the Company's production facility in 
Guanajuato, Mexico and other cost, quality and productivity initiatives. In 
addition, the additional borrowing capacity made available as a result of the 
use of a portion of the net proceeds of the Offerings to reduce outstanding 
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for capital 
expenditures, future acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Pending such 
uses, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds of the Offerings in short-
term investment grade, interest bearing securities or money market instruments.

repay outstanding revolving indebtedness of the Company. On December 31, 1998, 
the Company had revolving indebtedness outstanding of approximately $330.0 
million; approximately $77.0 million of such indebtedness was incurred in 
connection with the First Boston Transaction and the remainder was incurred to 
fund the Sinclair Transaction, other acquisitions and general corporate 
purposes. The current outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility has 
not been reduced by the $75.0 million proceeds from the Tampa Transaction as 
these funds are being held in a qualified intermediary account and will be used 
to fund in part the S Corporation Distribution. Following the Offering, the 
Company will fund the Second Boston Transaction and a portion of the S 
Corporation Distribution with revolving indebtedness under the Credit Facility.

approximately $173.2 million of indebtedness outstanding under the Credit 
Facility. The final maturity date for the Credit Facility is February 13, 2006. 
Interest on any outstanding principal accrues at a rate based, at the Company's 
election, on either LIBOR plus a spread which ranges from 0.5% to 2.125%, or on 
KeyBank N.A.'s base rate, plus a spread of up to 0.875%, in either case,

per share), are approximately $43.9 million after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company ($51.3 
million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). The 
Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock offered by 
the Selling Shareholders. 

The Company anticipates that it will use $12.0 million of the net proceeds of 
this Offering to redeem all of the Redeemable Preferred Stock to be issued upon 
the conversion of the Convertible Debentures and approximately $4.7 million of 
the proceeds to pay accrued interest due and payable on the Convertible 
Debentures. The maturity date of the Convertible Debentures is December 1, 1999 
with regard to $6.0 million in aggregate principal amount and December 1, 2000 
with regard to the remaining $6.0 million in aggregate principal amount, unless 
the Company consummates an initial public offering prior thereto, in which case 
the maturity dates would be accelerated to the date of such initial public 
offering. The Convertible Debentures accrued interest at a rate of 10% per 
annum through June 30, 1997 and began accruing interest at a rate of 15% per 
annum thereafter. The Company anticipates that a portion of the net proceeds 
will be used to effect the Distribution. At December 31, 1998, the estimated 
Distribution would have been approximately $850,000 subject to adjustment based 
on the Company's cash earnings through the date of its conversion to C 
corporation status. The balance of the net proceeds of this Offering will be 
used for the Company's expansion of marketing and sales resources, further 
international expansion, working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
To date, the Company does not have a quantified business plan with respect to 
the expansion of its marketing and sales resources and its facilities and 
business abroad. A portion of the net proceeds of this Offering may also be 
used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain 
the right to use complementary technologies. The Company is not currently a 
party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any such 
transaction and is not currently engaged in discussions with any party 
concerning any such possible transaction. Pending such uses, the Company 
intends to invest the net proceeds of this Offering in short-term, interest-

(1) A portion of the working capital will be used to pay certain expenses of the 
offering, and the balance will be used for general corporate purposes and to pay
 operating expenses, as well as for possible future capital contributions to Tower 
Bank. 
Tower Financial expects to contribute $17,000,000 of the net proceeds of the 
offering to Tower Bank by purchasing all of its common stock. The purchase of 
Tower Bank's common stock is intended to provide it with the capital required by
 regulators to commence operations.

Tower Financial expects to incur approximately $103,000 for expenses relating to 
the formation of Tower Bank, which expenses will be paid primarily out of working 
capital. A portion of these organizational expenses and other preopening and 
certain offering expenses were financed on an interim basis from loans of $760,000 
made to Tower Financial by current and former members of its board of directors.
 It is anticipated that these loans, which are non-interest bearing and are due 
on or before March 31, 1999, will be repaid by Tower Financial promptly following 
the completion of the offering. Preopening income (consisting solely of interest 
earned on temporary investments) will offset some of these expenses. 
The estimated $2,865,000 of net proceeds to be retained by Tower Financial
 (plus any net proceeds received as a result of the exercise of the underwriters' 
over-allotment option) will initially be invested by Tower Financial in investment 
grade securities and held by Tower Financial as working capital for general 
corporate purposes and to pay operating expenses, as well as for possible future 
capital contributions to Tower 
Bank. These funds will also be available to finance possible acquisitions of
 other branches or expansion into other lines of business closely related to 
banking, although Tower Financial presently has no plans to do so."

expenditures are expected to be funded by a portion of the net proceeds from 
this offering, together with existing cash balances and anticipated cash flow

deployment of the Company's networks in existing and new regions, for expenses

fund operating losses, provide working capital and for general corporate 
purposes. The Company believes that the net proceeds of this offering, together 
with the aggregate proceeds from the investments by the Strategic Investors, 
will be sufficient to fund the Company's aggregate capital expenditures and 
working capital requirements, including operating losses, through the end of 
1999. The amounts actually expended by the Company for these purposes will vary 
significantly depending upon a number of factors, including future revenue 
growth, if any, capital expenditures and the amount of cash generated by the 
Company's operations. Additionally, if the Company determines it would be in 
its best interest, the Company may increase or decrease the number, selection 
and timing of entry of its targeted regions. Accordingly, the Company's 
management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of such net proceeds. 
Although the Company may use a portion of the net proceeds to pursue possible 
acquisitions of businesses, technologies or products complementary to those of 
the Company in the future, there are no present understandings, commitments or 
agreements with respect to any such acquisitions. Pending use of such net 
proceeds for the above purposes, the Company intends to invest such funds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. See ""Risk Factors--

Neither the Holding Company nor the Bank has any immediate specific use for the 
proceeds to be raised in the offering. See ""THE CONVERSION -- Purposes of 
Conversion"" for a discussion of management's business reasons for undertaking 
the conversion. Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the common 
stock will increase the Bank's capital and will support the expansion of the 
Bank's existing business activities. The Bank will use the funds contributed to 
it for general corporate purposes, including, initially, lending and investment 
in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. Up to $700,000 of the 
funds received by the Bank will contribute to the construction of a new full-
service branch office. See ""BUSINESS OF THE BANK -- Properties."" The Bank may 
also use these funds to expand its banking operations through the acquisition 
of additional branches or other financial institutions. 

In connection with the conversion and the establishment of the ESOP, the 
Holding Company intends to loan the ESOP the amount necessary to purchase 8% of 
the shares of common stock sold in the conversion. The Holding Company's loan 
to fund the ESOP may range from $525,980 to $711,620 based on the sale of 
52,598 shares to the ESOP (at the minimum of the Estimated Valuation Range) and 
71,162 shares (at the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range), respectively, 
at $10.00 per share. If 15% above the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range, 
or 1,022,954 shares, are sold in the conversion, the Holding Company's loan to 
the ESOP would be approximately $818,360 (based on the sale of 81,836 shares to 
the ESOP). It is anticipated that the ESOP loan will have a 15-year term with 
interest payable at the prime rate as published in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL on 
the closing date of the conversion. The loan will be repaid principally from 
the Bank's contributions to the ESOP and from any dividends paid on shares of 
common stock held by the ESOP. 

The remaining net proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially will be 
invested primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. Such 
proceeds will be available for additional contributions to the Bank in the form 
of debt or equity, to support future diversification or acquisition activities, 
as a source of dividends to the stockholders of the Holding Company and for 
future repurchases of common stock to the extent permitted under Indiana law 
and federal regulations. The Holding Company will consider exploring 
opportunities to use such funds to expand operations through acquiring or 
establishing additional branch offices or acquiring other financial 
institutions. Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements, agreements 
or understandings, written or oral, regarding any expansion activities. 
Following consummation of the conversion, the Board of Directors will have the 
authority to adopt plans for repurchases of common stock, subject to statutory 
and regulatory requirements. Since the Holding Company has not yet issued 
stock, there currently is insufficient information upon which an intention to 
repurchase stock could be based. The facts and circumstances upon which the 
Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future would 
include but are not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the 
price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the 
attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return 
and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value 
and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the ability 
to improve the Holding Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of 
dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the 
exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) 
any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of 
the Holding Company and its stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject 
to a determination by the Board of Directors that both the Holding Company and 
the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory 
requirements after any such repurchases and that capital will be adequate, 
taking into account, among other things, the Bank's level of nonperforming and 
classified assets, the Holding Company's and the Bank's current and projected 
results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic environment 
and tax and other regulatory considerations. For a discussion of the regulatory 
limitations applicable to stock repurchases, see ""REGULATION -- Restrictions on 
Repurchase of Stock."""

The Company will use between $20.3 million and $20.5 million of the net 
proceeds of the Offering at the minimum and maximum, as adjusted, of the 
Offering Range, to purchase all of the Common Stock to be issued by the Bank. 
The portion of net proceeds received by the Bank from the Company will be added 
to the Bank's general funds and the Bank currently intends to invest 
substantially all of such funds initially in short-term investments. Over time, 
management currently intends to use the Offering proceeds for general corporate 
purposes, including increasing the Bank's loan originations and purchasing 
investment and mortgage-backed securities. The Bank will target commercial 
business and commercial real estate loans, along with residential mortgage and 
consumer loans. The Bank may also use such funds for the expansion of its 
retail banking franchise through new branch openings or acquisitions. Although 
management has not allocated specific amounts for any specific purpose, and the 
manner and timing of the Bank's deployment of the Offering proceeds will depend 
on market conditions, management believes that it is in the best interest of 
the Bank to conduct a stock offering so that it will have sufficient capital to 
take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise in the future. See ""Risk 
Factors--Management's Broad Discretion in Determining the Use of Proceeds."" To 
the extent that the stock-based benefit programs which the Company intends to 
adopt subsequent to the Offering are not funded with authorized but unissued 
shares of Common Stock, the Company or Bank may use net proceeds from the 
Offering to fund the purchase of stock to be awarded under such stock benefit 
programs. See ""Risk Factors--Possible Dilutive Effect of Issuance of Additional 
Shares"" and ""Management of the Bank--Executive Compensation--Stock Option Plan"" 
and ""--Recognition Plan."" 

The Company intends to use between $2.3 million and $3.6 million of the net 
proceeds it retains at the minimum and maximum, as adjusted, of the Offering 
Range to make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of 
the shares sold in the Offering, and between $1.1 million and $1.8 million may 
be used to fund the Recognition Plan's purchase of a number of shares equal to 
4% of the shares sold in the Offering. See ""Management of the Bank--Executive 
Compensation--Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust"" and ""--Recognition 
Plan."" The remaining proceeds retained by the Company will be invested 
initially in short- and medium-term investments. The net proceeds retained by 
the Company may also be used to support the future expansion of operations, 
including the acquisition of other financial institutions or diversification 
into other banking related businesses, although the Company and the Bank have 
no current arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding any such 
transactions. Management has not allocated specific amounts for any such 
specific purpose. Upon completion of the Reorganization, the Company will be 
regulated as a mutual holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act (the 
""HOLA"") and regulations of the OTS. See ""Regulation--Holding Company 
Regulation."" 

Upon completion of the Reorganization, the Board of Directors of the Company 
will have the authority to repurchase stock, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Based upon facts and circumstances following the 
Reorganization and subject to applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of 
Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and 
circumstances may include but not be limited to (i) market and economic factors 
such as the price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of 
trading, the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the 
rate of return and risk involved in the investment, and the opportunity to 
improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders. Current OTS policy restricts the Company from 
implementing a stock repurchase program for at least six months following the 
completion of the Offering. In the event the Company determines to repurchases 
stock, such repurchases may be made at market prices which may be in excess of 
the Subscription Price in the Offering. To the extent that the Company 
repurchases stock at market prices in excess of the per share book value, such 
repurchases may have a dilutive effect upon stockholders' equity per share of 
Common Stock."
RIDGEWOOD FINANCIAL INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/ridgewood-financial-inc-6618-5344,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/ridgewood-financial-inc-6618-5344,424B3,11/20/1998,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1490308,"The net proceeds will depend on the total number of shares of common 
stock sold in the offering, which will be dependent on the independent 
valuation and marketing considerations, and the expenses incurred in connection 
with the offering. Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of the common 
stock cannot be determined until the offering is completed, it is estimated 
that net proceeds, assuming the sale of 1,198,500 and 1,621,500 shares of stock 
at $7.00 per share, would be approximately $7,789,500 and $10,750,500 
respectively. The actual net proceeds may vary from these estimates because, 
among other things, actual expenses may be more or less than those estimated. 

Of the net proceeds at least one half will be used by the Company to purchase 
100% of the common stock of the Bank that is issued. Of the remainder of the 
net proceeds, the mutual holding company will receive $200,000 as its initial 
capitalization and the Company will retain the rest. The net proceeds from the 
offering will be used for general corporate purposes and will increase the 
Bank's total capital to expand investment and lending, internal growth, and 
possible external growth through the acquisition of branch offices, expansion 
into new lending areas, and other acquisitions. Regardless of the offering, 
the Bank intends to acquire property in Ridgewood, New Jersey that will become 
the administrative center of the Company, MHC and the Bank and also serve as a 
branch office of the Bank. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Recent 
Developments."" Net proceeds will initially be invested in U.S. government and 
federal agency securities, marketable securities, or a combination of both. 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains to make a 
loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase stock in the offering, 
or in the open market to the extent the stock is not available to fill the 
ESOP's subscription. In the event the ESOP does not purchase common stock in 
the offering, the ESOP may purchase shares of common stock in the market after 
the reorganization. In the event the purchase price of the common stock is 
higher than $7.00 per share, the amount of proceeds required for the purchase 
by the ESOP will increase and the resulting stockholders' equity will decrease. 
Net proceeds may also be used to make contributions to the ESOP which in turn 
would be used to repay the loan. 
The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the reorganization may be 
more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the 
number of shares to be sold in the offering are adjusted to reflect a change 
in the estimated pro forma market value of the Company and the Bank. Payments 
for shares made through withdrawals from existing Bank deposit accounts will 
not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by the Bank but will 
result in a reduction of the Bank's deposits and interest expense as funds are 
transferred from interest bearing certificates or other deposit accounts."

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $65.3 
million and $88.7 million (or $102.3 million if the Estimated Price Range is 
increased by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion--Stock Pricing"" as 
to the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Company will be unable 
to utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offerings until the consummation of 
the Conversion. 

The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the 
Association to be issued upon Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net 
proceeds of the Offerings, with the remaining net proceeds to be retained by 
the Company. Based on net proceeds of $65.3 million to $88.7 million, the 
Company expects to utilize between $32.6 million and $44.3 million of net 
proceeds to purchase the common stock of the Association. Such portion of net 
proceeds received by the Association from the Company will be added to the 
Association's general funds to permit the Association to expand its lending and 
investment activities and to enhance customer services. The Association 
currently intends to utilize the net proceeds received for general corporate 
purposes, including investment in loans and securities, as well as the possible 
expansion of its facilities and operations through marketing, business 
development, or the acquisition or establishment of branch offices, although 
the Company and the Association have no current arrangements, understandings or 
agreements regarding any such transactions. The Association anticipates that 
the portion of the net proceeds received by the Association will initially be 
invested in overnight funds and short-term investments with maturities of up to 
three years. To the extent that the stock-based benefit programs which the 
Company or the Association intend to adopt subsequent to the Conversion are not 
funded with authorized but unissued common stock of the Company, the Company or 
Association may use net proceeds from the Conversion to fund the purchase of 
stock to be awarded under such stock benefit programs. The Association has not 
yet determined the approximate amount of net proceeds to be used for any of the 
purposes mentioned above. While the amount of net proceeds received by the 
Association will further strengthen the Association's capital position, which 
already substantially exceeds all regulatory requirements, it should be noted 
that the Association is not converting primarily to raise capital. Rather, one 
of the principal purposes for the Conversion is to structure the Association in 
the stock form used in the United States by all commercial banks, most major 
business organizations and most savings institutions. See ""Risk Factors--Stock-
Based Benefits to Management, Employment Contracts and Change in Control 
Payments"" and ""Management of the Association--Benefit Plans--Stock Option 
Plan"" and ""--Stock Program."" 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains (i.e., 50% 
of the net proceeds, which based on net proceeds of $65.3 million to $88.7 
million will be between $32.6 million and $44.3 million) to make a loan 
directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase in the Conversion 8% of the 
Common Stock issued in connection with the Conversion, including shares issued 
to the Foundation. Based upon the sale of 6,709,135 shares or 9,077,065 shares 
at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated Price Range, and the issuance of 
shares to the Foundation, the amount of the loan to the ESOP would be $5.8 
million or $7.8 million, respectively (or $9.0 million if the Estimated Price 
Range is increased by 15%), with a term of 15 years at the prevailing prime 
rate of interest. The Company and Association may alternatively choose to fund 
the ESOP's stock purchases through a loan by a third party financial 
institution. See ""Management of the Association--Benefit Plans--ESOP."" The 
remaining net proceeds retained by the Company will initially be invested in 
mortgage-backed and investment securities. 

Ultimately, the net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to 
support the future expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the 
establishment of branch offices and the acquisition of savings associations and 
commercial banks or their assets, including those located within the 
Association's market area or diversification into other banking related 
businesses. The Company and the Association have no current arrangements, 
understandings or agreements regarding any such transactions. The Company, upon 
the Conversion, will be a unitary savings and loan holding company, which under 
existing laws would not be restricted as to the types of business activities in 
which it may engage. See ""Regulation--Holding Company Regulation"" for a 
description of certain regulations applicable to the Company. The Company may 
also determine to pay dividends, make a tax-free return of capital, repurchase 
Common Stock and fund the Stock Program. However, the Company and the 
Association have committed to the OTS that they will take no action to further 
the payment of any return of capital during the one-year period following 
consummation of the Conversion. See ""Dividend Policy."" 

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company will 
have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, the Company, pursuant to 
OTS regulations, will be prohibited from repurchasing any shares of Common 
Stock for three years except (i) for an offer to all stockholders on a pro rata 
basis, or (ii) for the repurchase of qualifying shares of a director. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided below, beginning one year 
following completion of the Conversion, the OTS regulations permit the Company 
to repurchase its Common Stock so long as: (i) the repurchases within the 
following two years are part of an open-market program not involving greater 
than 5% of its outstanding capital stock during a twelve-month period; (ii) the 
repurchases do not cause the Association to become ""undercapitalized"" within 
the meaning of the OTS prompt corrective action regulation; and (iii) the 
Company provides to the Regional Director of the OTS no later than ten days 
prior to the commencement of a repurchase program written notice containing a 
full description of the program to be undertaken and such program is not 
disapproved by the Regional Director. See ""Regulation--Prompt Corrective 
Regulatory Action."" In addition, under current OTS policies, repurchases may be 
allowed in the first year following Conversion and in amounts greater than 5% 
in the second and third years following Conversion provided there are valid and 
compelling business reasons for such repurchases and the OTS does not object to 
such repurchases. 
Based upon facts and circumstances following the Conversion and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but 
not be limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which 
the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness 
of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk 
involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or 
earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to 
improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders. In the event the Company determines to repurchase 
stock, such repurchases may be made at market prices which may be in excess of 
the Purchase Price in the Conversion and in excess of the per share book value.
 To the extent that the Company repurchases stock at market prices in excess of 
the per share book value, such repurchases may have a dilutive effect upon the 
interests of existing stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject to 
the determination of the Board of Directors that both the Company and the 
Association will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory 
requirements after any such repurchases and that such capital will be adequate, 
taking into account, among other things, the level of non-performing and other 
risk assets, the Company's and the Association's current and projected results 
of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic environment, tax and 
other considerations. See ""The Conversion--Certain Restrictions on Purchase or

Common Stock and fund the Stock Program. However, the Company and the 
Association have committed to the OTS that they will take no action to further 
the payment of any return of capital during the one-year period following 
consummation of the Conversion. See ""Dividend Policy."" 

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company will 
have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, the Company, pursuant to 
OTS regulations, will be prohibited from repurchasing any shares of Common 
Stock for three years except (i) for an offer to all stockholders on a pro rata 
basis, or (ii) for the repurchase of qualifying shares of a director. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided below, beginning one year 
following completion of the Conversion, the OTS regulations permit the Company 
to repurchase its Common Stock so long as: (i) the repurchases within the 
following two years are part of an open-market program not involving greater 
than 5% of its outstanding capital stock during a twelve-month period; (ii) the 
repurchases do not cause the Association to become ""undercapitalized"" within 
the meaning of the OTS prompt corrective action regulation; and (iii) the 
Company provides to the Regional Director of the OTS no later than ten days 
prior to the commencement of a repurchase program written notice containing a 
full description of the program to be undertaken and such program is not 
disapproved by the Regional Director. See ""Regulation--Prompt Corrective 
Regulatory Action."" In addition, under current OTS policies, repurchases may be 
allowed in the first year following Conversion and in amounts greater than 5% 
in the second and third years following Conversion provided there are valid and 
compelling business reasons for such repurchases and the OTS does not object to 
such repurchases. 
Based upon facts and circumstances following the Conversion and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but 
not be limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which 
the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness 
of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk 
involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or 
earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to 
improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders. In the event the Company determines to repurchase 
stock, such repurchases may be made at market prices which may be in excess of 
the Purchase Price in the Conversion and in excess of the per share book value.
 To the extent that the Company repurchases stock at market prices in excess of 
the per share book value, such repurchases may have a dilutive effect upon the 
interests of existing stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject to 
the determination of the Board of Directors that both the Company and the 
Association will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory 
requirements after any such repurchases and that such capital will be adequate, 
taking into account, among other things, the level of non-performing and other 
risk assets, the Company's and the Association's current and projected results 
of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic environment, tax and 
other considerations. See ""The Conversion--Certain Restrictions on Purchase or
 Transfer of Shares after Conversion."""
COHOES BANCORP INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cohoes-bancorp-inc-4276-10664,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cohoes-bancorp-inc-4276-10664,424B3,12/2/1998,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1265352,"Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of the Conversion Shares cannot 
be determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated 
that such net proceeds will be between $57.9 million and $76.7 million (or up 
to $90.6 million in the event of an increase in the aggregate pro forma market 
value of the Holding Company Common Stock of up to 15% above the maximum of the 
Estimated Valuation Range). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion - Stock 
Pricing"" and ""--Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to 
arrive at such amounts. 

In exchange for all of the common stock of the Bank issued in the Conversion, 
the Holding Company will contribute approximately 50% of the net proceeds from 
the sale of the Conversion Shares to the Bank. On an interim basis, the 
proceeds will be invested by the Holding Company and the Bank in short-term 
investments similar to those currently in the Bank's portfolio. The specific 
types and amounts of short-term assets will be determined based on market 
conditions at the time of the completion of the Conversion. In addition, the 
Holding Company intends to provide the funding for the ESOP loan. Based upon 
the initial purchase price of $10.00 per share, the dollar amount of the ESOP 
loan would range from $4.9 million (based upon the sale of shares at the 
minimum of the Estimated Valuation Range) to $6.6 million (based upon the sale 
of shares at the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range). The interest rate 
to be charged by the Holding Company on the ESOP loan will be based upon the 
prime rate of interest as reported in the Wall Street Journal at the time of 
origination. It is anticipated that the ESOP will repay the loan through 
periodic tax-deductible contributions from the Bank over a fifteen-year period.

The net proceeds received by the Bank will become part of the Bank's general 
funds for use in its business and will be used to support the Bank's existing 
operations, subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. Immediately upon the 
completion of the Conversion, it is anticipated that the Bank will invest such 
proceeds into short-term assets. Subsequently, the Bank intends to redirect the 
net proceeds to the origination of loans, subject to market conditions. 

After the completion of the Conversion, the Holding Company will redirect the 
net proceeds invested by it in short-term assets into a variety of securities 
similar to those already held by the Bank, as well as in deposit accounts with 
the Bank. Also, the Holding Company may use a portion of the proceeds to fund 
the RRP, subject to stockholder approval of such plan. Compensation expense 
related to the RRP will be recognized as share awards vest. See ""Pro Forma Data.
"" Following stockholder ratification of the RRP, the RRP will be funded either 
with shares purchased in the open market or with authorized but unissued shares.
 Based upon the initial purchase price of $10.00 per share, the amount required
 to fund the RRP through open-market purchases would range from approximately 
$2.5 million (based upon the sale of shares at the minimum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range and including shares issued to the Foundation) to approximately 
$3.3 million (based upon the sale of shares at the maximum of the Estimated
 Valuation Range). In the event that the per share price of the Holding Company 
Common Stock increases above the $10.00 per share purchase price following 
completion of the Offering, the amount necessary to fund the RRP would also 
increase. The use of authorized but unissued shares to fund the RRP could 
dilute the holdings of stockholders who purchase Holding Company Common Stock 
in the Conversion and who receive Exchange Shares in the Merger. See ""Business 
of the Bank - Lending Activities"" and "" - Investment Activities"" and ""Management
 of the Bank - Benefit Plans - Employee Stock Ownership Plan"" and ""- RRP."" 

The proceeds may also be utilized by the Holding Company to repurchase (at 
prices which may be above or below the initial offering price) shares of the 
Holding Company Common Stock through an open market repurchase program subject 
to applicable regulations, although the Holding Company currently has no 
specific plan to repurchase any of its stock. In the future, the Board of 
Directors of the Holding Company will make decisions on the repurchase of the 
Holding Company Common Stock based on its view of the appropriateness of the 
price of the Holding Company Common Stock as well as the Holding Company's and 
the Bank's investment opportunities and capital needs. 

The Bank may use a portion of the proceeds to fund the creation of one or more 
new branch offices within its primary market area. In addition, the Holding 
Company or the Bank might consider expansion through the acquisition of other 
financial services providers (or branches, deposits or assets thereof), 
although there are no specific plans, negotiations or written or oral 
agreements regarding any acquisitions at this time."

proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies or businesses; 
however, we currently have no commitments or agreements and are not involved in 
any negotiations to do so. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we

commissions and estimated offering expenses. The net proceeds to Invitrogen 
would increase to $48,423,750 if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full. 

We will use approximately $14.0 million of the net proceeds for redemption of 
the redeemable preferred stock issuable upon the conversion of the convertible 
preferred stock upon the closing of this offering at an initial public offering 
price of $15.00 per share and approximately $1.5 million for the payment of 
accrued dividends on the convertible preferred stock.

- The redemption of the redeemable subsidiary common stock of our subsidiary, 
Invitrogen B.V., on April 7, 1999 in the amount of Netherlands Guilder (NLG) 
3,150,000 or an equivalent of USD $1,676,000 at December 31, 1998 exchange 
rates 

- The continued development and manufacture of existing products and services 

- Research and development of additional products and services 

- Working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potential 
acquisitions of products, technologies or companies 

While we from time to time engage in preliminary discussions with respect to 
acquisitions, we are not a party to any agreements, understandings or 
commitments with respect to such transactions. We will invest the net proceeds 
in short-term, interest bearing, investment grade securities. 

Based on our current operating plan, we anticipate that the net proceeds of 
this offering, together with our available cash, expected interest income and 
funds from operations, should be sufficient to finance our capital requirements

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase the Company's working 
capital, to create a public market for the Company's Class A Common Stock, to 
facilitate future access by the Company to public equity markets, and to provide
increased visibility and credibility to the Company. The Company presently has 
no specific plans for use of the net proceeds of this offering. The Company

from substantial investment in expanding the Company's sales and marketing 
organization, and capital expenditures. The Company may, when and if the 
opportunity arises, use an unspecified portion of the net proceeds to acquire 
or invest in complementary businesses, products and technologies. The Company 
has no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any 
material acquisition of, or investment in, third parties. The Company believes 
that its existing capital resources, combined with the net proceeds of this 
offering, will be sufficient to meet its presently anticipated cash requirements
through at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that the Company 
will not be required to raise additional financing prior to such time, that 
additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, such 
financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company and its 
stockholders. Pending use of the net proceeds for the above purposes, the

commitments in the aggregate of $2,200,000. We have a $500,000 demand loan with 
North County Bank that is due in May 1999. 

We also owe $1,180,000 on a note payable to North County Bank that is due over 
five years beginning in January 1999. The proceeds from this loan were used to 
repay two separate credit facilities in the amount of $1.55 million, and the 
balance was used for working capital. We also have a line of credit with Bank 
of America of $500,000 that is due July 2000. All of the borrowings accrue 
interest at each bank's prime rate. We will use the offering's proceeds to 
repay outstanding balances on these borrowings. We estimate that at the closing 
of the offering the outstanding balances owed on these borrowings will be 
$1,905,000. 

We will also use the proceeds to repay $245,000 of the debt that was incurred 
in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and 
certain liabilities of Wyman Enterprises, Inc. Of this amount, we owe $37,500

offering price of $13.00 per share (approximately $42.4 million if the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for additional 
working capital, repayment of short-term indebtedness, capital equipment 
purchases and other general corporate purposes, including increased domestic 
and international sales and marketing expenditures, increased research and 
development expenditures, and capital expenditures made in the ordinary course 
of our business. Specifically, we plan to use a portion of the net proceeds to
 repay the outstanding balance on our working capital revolving line of credit
 with Silicon Valley Bank. As of December 31, 1998, we had borrowed $3.9 
million under this facility. The working capital revolving line of credit bears 
interest at Silicon Valley Bank's prime rate, which was 7.75% as of December
 31, 1998. In addition, we plan to use approximately $2.3 million of the net
 proceeds for capital equipment purchases associated with our planned 
relocation of our principal administrative, sales, marketing, support and 
research and development facilities in July 1999. We plan to use the remainder
 of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. We may 
also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire additional businesses, 
products and technologies or to establish joint ventures that we believe will 
complement our current or future business. However, we have no specific oral or 
written plans, agreements or commitments to do so, and are not currently 
negotiating any such acquisition or joint venture. The amounts that we actually 
expend for working capital purposes will vary significantly depending on a 
number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, the amount of cash 
we generate from operations and the progress of our product development 
efforts. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in allocating the net 
proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, we will invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."
SOUTH JERSEY FINANCIAL CORP INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/south-jersey-financial-corp-inc-5904-4530,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/south-jersey-financial-corp-inc-5904-4530,424B3,12/31/1998,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1352712,"The Board of Directors has carefully considered the alternatives available
to the Association with respect to its corporate structure and has determined
that a mutual to stock conversion is in the best interests of the Association,
its depositors and the communities served by the Association. The Board of
Directors believes that the capital raising advantages enjoyed by commercial
banks, more and more thrift institutions and the other types of financial
institutions with which it competes places the Association, as a mutual
institution, at a competitive disadvantage. The restructuring of the Association
into the capital stock form of organization should enable the Association to
compete more effectively through the possible ability to increase its equity
capital base and the possibility of access to capital markets, when needed,
and could promote the Association's ability to expand its franchise and the
products it offers. Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of common
stock by the Company cannot be determined until the sale is completed, it is
presently anticipated that such net proceeds will be between $26.8 million and
$36.6 million (or $42.2 million if the number of shares sold is increased by
15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion-- Stock Pricing"" as to the
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts.
     The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the
Association to be issued in the Association's conversion in exchange for 50% of
the net proceeds from the Company's sale of common stock and will retain the
remaining net proceeds. The number of shares of common stock proposed to be sold
by the Company is based on the $10 per share offering price and an estimate by
FinPro, Inc. (""FinPro""), an independent appraiser, of the aggregate pro forma
market value of the common stock to be sold. FinPro has estimated that pro forma
market value to range between a minimum of $28.0 million to a maximum of $37.8
million, with a midpoint of $32.9 million (the ""Estimated Price Range""). Based
on the midpoint of the Estimated Price Range, the Company expects to use $15.8
million of net proceeds to purchase the common stock of the Association. Such
portion of net proceeds will be added to the Association's general funds which
the Association intends to use for general business purposes, including
investments in loans and mortgage-backed and investment securities, and the
planned expansion of its operations facilities. The Association may also use
such funds to expand operations through acquisitions of other financial
institutions, branch offices or other financial services companies. The
Association has not yet determined the approximate amount of net proceeds to be
used for any of the purposes mentioned above. Neither the Association nor the
Company has any current arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding any
such opportunities or transactions.
     The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds retained by it to
make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of the Common
Stock sold and issued to the Foundation. The Company and Association may
alternatively choose to fund the ESOP's stock purchases through a loan by a
third-party financial institution. The remaining net proceeds retained by the
Company will initially be invested in federal funds and securities, primarily
mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government and agency obligations. Based
upon the combined sale of common stock and issuance of shares to the Foundation
of 3,020,220 shares, 3,553,200 shares or 4,086,180 shares at the minimum,
midpoint and maximum of the Estimated Price Range, respectively (or 4,699,107
shares if the Estimated Price Range is increased by 15%), the amount of the loan
to the ESOP would be $2.4 million, $2.8 million or $3.3 million, respectively
(or $3.8 million if the Estimated Price Range is increased by 15%) to be repaid
over a 15-year period at the prevailing prime rate of interest, which currently
is 8.5%. See ""Management of the Association -- Other Benefit Plans--Employee
Stock Ownership Plan and Trust.""
     The Company will be a unitary savings and loan holding company, which under
existing laws would generally not be restricted as to the types of business
activities in which it may engage, provided that the Association continues to be
a qualified thrift lender (""QTL""). See ""Regulation--Holding Company Regulation""
for a description of regulations applicable to the Company.
     The Board of Directors of the Company will have the authority to adopt
stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements.
Current OTS regulations generally prohibit the Company from repurchasing any
shares of common stock for three years except (i) for an offer to all
stockholders on a pro rata basis, or (ii) for the repurchase of qualifying
shares of a director. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided
below, beginning one year following completion of the Association's conversion,
the OTS regulations permit the Company to repurchase its common stock so long
as: (i) the repurchases within the following two years are part of an open-
market program not involving greater than 5% of its outstanding capital
stock during a 12-month period; (ii) the repurchases do not cause the
Association to become ""undercapitalized"" within the meaning of the OTS prompt
corrective action regulation; and (iii) the Company provides to the Regional
Director of the OTS no later than 10 days prior to the commencement of a
repurchase program written notice containing a full description of the program
to be undertaken and such program is not disapproved by the Regional Director.
See ""Regulation--Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action."" Under current OTS
policies, repurchases may be allowed in the first year following the
Association's conversion and in amounts greater than 5% in the second and third
years following that conversion provided there are valid and compelling business
reasons for such repurchases and the OTS does not object to such repurchases.
     Based upon facts and circumstances and subject to applicable regulatory
requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the
future. Such facts and circumstances may include but are not limited to: (i)
market and economic factors such as the price at which the common stock is
trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other
investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the
investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of
the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to improve the Company's
return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having
to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund
employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which
repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Although the Company has no current plans to repurchase its stock, in the event
the Company does determine to repurchase stock, such repurchases could impact
the market price of the Common Stock.
     Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of
Directors that both the Company and the Association will be capitalized in
excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and
that such capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, the
level of non-performing and other risk assets, the Company's and the
Association's current and projected results of operations and asset/liability
structure, the economic environment, tax and other considerations.  See ""The
Conversion-- Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After
Conversion.""
     Additionally, the Company and Association have committed to the OTS that
during the one-year period following the completion of the Association's
conversion, the Company will not make any distribution to stockholders that, for
federal tax purposes, would be treated as a return of capital without prior
approval of the OTS."

shares of common stock (and an additional $10,881,000 from the sale of 900,000 
shares if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the 
initial public offering price of $13.00 per share after deducting underwriting 
commissions and discounts of $3,640,000 (and an additional $819,000 if the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) and estimated 
expenses of $850,000. SERENA will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
common stock by the selling stockholders. 

The principal purpose of this offering is to create a public market for the 
common stock of SERENA. We intend to use the proceeds of the offering for 
working capital, general corporate purposes and potential strategic investments 
or acquisitions that complement our products, services, technologies or 
distribution channels. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
of the initial public offering in investment grade interest-bearing securities. 

We expect that future acquisitions, if any, could provide for consideration to 
be paid in cash, shares of SERENA common stock, or a combination of cash and 
SERENA common stock. If the consideration for an acquisition transaction is 
paid in common stock, this would further dilute existing stockholders. Any 
amortization of goodwill or other assets resulting from an acquisition 
transaction could materially impair our operating results and financial 
condition."

million in the aggregate, associated with the network upgrade (40- 60%), the 
build and launch of our telephone and Internet/data businesses (20-40%), and 
new activities in our video distribution and programming businesses (15-25%), 
. until we make these investments, to repay NLG620 million of debt owed under 
our senior revolving credit facility, which we plan to reborrow under that 
facility to use for these investments, . to pay approximately NLG507 million as 
the cash portion of the purchase price for the remaining 49% of UTH we do not 
own, including a NLG33 million subordinated note and related interest owed by 
UTH to NUON, . to repay approximately NLG156 million of indebtedness and the 
interest on this amount owed to UIH,

including governmental obligations and other money market instruments. 

Our senior revolving credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 
0.5% to 2.0% and matures in 2006. Our bridge bank facility bears interest at 
LIBOR plus a margin of 4.5% to 6.0% and matures in June 1999. As of September 
30, 1998, approximately NLG972 million was outstanding under our senior 
revolving credit facility and NLG114 million was outstanding under our bridge 
bank facility. Part of our senior revolving credit facility was used to 
refinance some of our operating companies' indebtedness. Part of our senior 
revolving credit facility and our entire bridge bank facility were used to fund 
UIH's acquisition of its partner's interest in us. 

The UIH loan bears interest at 10.75% per annum. As of September 30, 1998, 
approximately NLG156 million was outstanding under this loan. The funds loaned 
by UIH were used to reduce our indebtedness under the bridge bank facility and 
to fund business operations. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital 
Resources"". 
DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our ordinary

Spanish-speaking and Hispanic customers in the United States. See ""Risk Factors

See ""Risk Factors--Management Discretion Regarding Use of Proceeds"". Pending 
the application of the net proceeds from the Offerings, the Company intends to

The Company evaluates acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis and at any

respect to possible acquisitions or other business combinations. The Company 
may seek strategic acquisitions that can complement the Company's current or 
planned business activities, particularly the expansion of value-added services 
such as Web hosting. The Company may also seek to acquire other ISPs as an 
additional means of customer acquisition or entry into new markets. A portion

---------------------------


 

(1) The remaining proceeds of the Offering will also be available for possible 
future capital contributions to the Bank, to finance possible acquisitions of 
other financial institutions, or to fund the Company's expansion into other 
lines of business closely related to banking. 

The Company believes that the net proceeds of the Offering will satisfy the 
Company's cash requirements for at least the twelve month period following the 
opening of the Bank. Pending the use of proceeds for such purpose, the Company 
expects to invest the proceeds of the Offering in short-term investment grade 
securities. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation."" 

The Line of Credit bears interest at a variable rate to be adjusted based on the
changes in a published ""Prime Rate""; the November Line of Credit was set 
initially at 8.0% per annum and the December Line of Credit was set initially at 
7.75% per annum. Payments of accrued interest on the November Line of Credit are
to be made quarterly beginning February 15, 1999. Payments of accrued interest 
on the December Line of Credit are to be made quarterly beginning March 31, 1999.
The Line of Credit matures on July 15, 1999. The Organizational Loans bear 
interest at the rate of 8% per annum from their respective dates of issuance to 
March 31, 1998, and at the rate of 13% per annum from April 1, 1998 until paid. 
The Organizational Loans matured on January 31, 1999. The Advances do not bear 
interest, and the letter agreements documenting the Advances do not provide for 
a right of repayment on any date. For each month that the Organizational Loans 
and the current balance on the Line of Credit remain outstanding thereafter, 
aggregate interest will accrue at the rate of approximately $7,900 per month. 
The proceeds of the Organizational Loans, Advances, and the Line of Credit have
been used by the Company to pay organizational and pre-opening expenses of the 
Company and the Bank. These expenses include (i) a loan referral fee equal to 
10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Organizational Loans paid to the 
Underwriter for its efforts in locating the lenders, (ii) attorney, accounting 
and consulting fees, (iii) repayment of the principal, interest and funding fees
of five Organizational Loans, and (iv) office and equipment rental and purchase,
employee salaries and benefits, and government filing and application fees. 

USE BY BANK 

The $9,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering used by the Company to

of ABCC and related expenses, approximately $6.2 million for the acquisition of
 CPI and related expenses, $6.3 million for the acquisition of ABCI and related 
expenses, and approximately $4.4 million ($9.8 million if the Underwriters' over-

(1) The Company's junior subordinated notes (the ""Junior Subordinated Notes"") 
were issued in private placements to a number of individual investors. The 
Junior Subordinated Notes have maturities ranging from April 1, 1999 to December
 1, 2003 and bear interest at rates ranging from 8.0% to 12.0% per annum at 
December 31, 1998. The Company has borrowed $1.3 million principal amount of 
the Junior Subordinated Notes since December 31, 1997, with proceeds thereof 
used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of leases, contracts 
and loans which were not otherwise eligible for funding under the Company's 
Credit Facilities. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations"", ""Description of Certain Indebtedness"" and 
Note E to the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in 
this Prospectus. 
(2) This amount is based on the Company's expectations under current market 
conditions. If market conditions at the time of consummation of the Offering 
are substantially different than management's expectations, the Company may 
choose to use proceeds otherwise earmarked for repayment of senior subordinated 
debt to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities. As of December 
31, 1998, the Company had (a) $4.5 million outstanding under its subordinated 
note with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, all of which bears 
interest at a fixed rate of 12.0% per annum and matures on July 15, 2001, (b) 
$4.6 million outstanding under its subordinated note with Rothschild Inc., all
 of which bears interest at a fixed rate of 12.25% per annum and matures on 
October 1, 2001 and (c) $5.0 million outstanding under its subordinated note 
with Aegon Insurance Group, all of which bears interest at a fixed rate of 
12.6% per annum and matures on October 15, 2003. None of such indebtedness was 
incurred within one year. 

(3) The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds of the Offering to 
repay amounts outstanding under its Credit Facilities (other than $17.5 million 
principal amount subject to a fixed rate swap agreement which would not be 
repaid with proceeds of the Offering). As of December 31, 1998, the Company had 
$39.3 million in revolving credit and term loans outstanding under its facility 
led by Fleet Bank, N.A. and, excluding the amount subject to the swap agreement,
 $5.9 million in revolving credit and term loans outstanding under its facility 
led by BankBoston, N.A. Of these amounts, $3.7 million is a term loan which 
bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.75% per annum and matures on August 2, 
1999; and $41.5 million is a revolving credit loan which bears interest at the 
prime or base rate of each of the agent banks and which converts to a term loan 
on July 31, 1999 (the ""Commitment Termination Date"") that matures no later than 
the fourth anniversary of the Commitment Termination Date as to $35.6 million 
principal amount and no later than the second anniversary of the Commitment 
Termination Date as to $5.9 million principal amount. See ""Description of 
Certain Indebtedness"" and Note E to the Company's consolidated financial 
statements included elsewhere in this Prospectus. 

(4) While the Company currently does not intend to use the net proceeds from
 the Offering or existing resources to consummate acquisitions, the Company 
intends, as part of its business strategy, to evaluate future acquisitions of 
leasing companies or lease portfolios, and may use a portion of the net 
proceeds from the Offering to make such acquisitions. The Company presently is 
not negotiating, nor does it have any agreements or understandings, to make any 
such acquisitions. See ""Business -- Strategy."""

Stock offered hereby, after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated 
offering expenses payable by the Company, are estimated to be $45.5 million 
($52.5 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in 
full). The Company expects to use the net proceeds as follows: (i) 
approximately $7.9 million will be used to repay indebtedness incurred in 
connection with the Share Repurchase; (ii) approximately $5.0 million will be 
used to repay a portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness under its 
existing credit facility with Fleet Bank, N.A. (the ""Credit Facility""), 
including fees and accrued and unpaid interest; and (iii) the balance will be 
used for additional capital expenditures and for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes. The Company's outstanding indebtedness under the 
Credit Facility, which will be partially repaid with a portion of the proceeds 
of this offering, was incurred to finance the expansion of the Company's 
facilities. The Company routinely evaluates potential acquisitions of 
businesses and products that would complement or expand the Company's business. 
The Company may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for one or 
more acquisitions; however, it currently has no commitments or agreements with 
respect to such transactions. Pending such use, the balance of the net proceeds 
will be invested in short-term, investment grade, interest bearing obligations. 

The Credit Facility consists of a $15 million, three-year, revolving line of 
credit, which thereafter converts into a five-year term loan. The Credit 
Facility will expire in July 2006. As of November 30, 1998, the Company had an 
aggregate outstanding principal balance of $7.0 million under the Credit 
Facility. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest at 
variable rates which are based upon, at the option of the Company, the lender's 
prime rate or LIBOR. The interest rate on such indebtedness at November 30, 
1998 was approximately 5.83% per annum. The notes issued in the Share 
Repurchase mature on October 28, 2003 and bear interest at the prime rate, 
7.75% at November 30, 1998. See ""Capitalization,"" ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Liquidity and

Upon satisfaction of all of the conditions discussed in ""The Offering-- 
Conditions to the Offering and Release of Funds,"" all subscription funds held 
in escrow for this Offering and the Private Offering will be released and will 
become capital of the Company. The Company expects that net proceeds from the 
sale of the Minimum and Maximum will be $1,467,950 and $3,076,150, respectively,
after deducting the Sales Agent's commission (which the Company anticipates will
be $102,050 if the Minimum is sold and $213,850 if the Maximum is sold). The net
proceeds from the Private Offering will be $1,210,000. 

The Company plans to use $1,390,000 of the estimated net proceeds from the sale 
of the Minimum plus $1,210,000 in net proceeds from the sale of shares to the 
Organizers in the Private Offering, a total of $2,600,000, to capitalize the 
Bank by purchasing all the Bank's common stock to be issued. The Company expects
that the DOC and FDIC will require the Bank to be capitalized at a level of at 
least $2,500,000 before it can commence banking operations. Approximately 
$75,000 of net proceeds will be used to pay organizational and offering expenses
of the Company, including legal and accounting fees, printing expenses and blue 
sky fees and expenses, some of which have been advanced by the Organizers (as of
June 30, 1998, approximately $18,665 of the Company's organizational expenses 
have been funded by the Organizers). The Company plans to initially invest all 
remaining sums in United States government securities or as a deposit at the 
Bank. Such funds may be used to purchase additional capital stock of the Bank or
make loans to the Bank as necessary to maintain compliance with regulatory 
capital requirements and borrowing restrictions as the Bank grows. 

The following table sets forth the anticipated use of proceeds by the Company 
from this Offering and the Private Offering based on the sale of the Minimum and
Maximum number of shares in this Offering.

BY THE BANK 
The Company anticipates that approximately $433,000 will be used for pre- 
opening expenses of the Bank including leasehold improvements and the 
acquisition of furniture, fixtures, and equipment (including computer 
equipment), and $70,000 for organizational expenses of the Bank including 
consulting fees, expenses for market analysis and feasibility studies, and 
legal fees and expenses. The balance of the proceeds to be received by the Bank 
and available for use in the first year (estimated at $2,097,000 if the Minimum 
or the Maximum is sold) will be used for loans to customers, investments, and 
other general corporate purposes. 

The following table depicts the anticipated use of proceeds by the Bank. 
All proceeds received by the Bank will be in the form of an investment by the 
Company in the Bank's capital stock.

(3) Includes proceeds from subscriptions purchased by the Organizers in the

Although the amounts set forth above provide an indication of the proposed use 
of funds based on the Organizers' plans and estimates, actual expenses may vary 
from the estimates. These estimates were based on assumptions that the 
Organizers believed were reasonable, but as to which no assurances can be given.
The Organizers believe that the estimated minimum net proceeds of this Offering 
will satisfy the cash requirements of the Company and the Bank for their 
respective first three years of operations and that neither the Company nor the 
Bank will need to raise additional funds for operations during this period, but 
there can be no assurance that this will be the case. 

Pending utilization of the net proceeds of this Offering, the Company plans to 
invest net proceeds in short-term money market investments, high grade 
commercial paper and interest-bearing bank accounts."

common stock to be between $73.2 million and $99.5 million, depending upon the 
number of shares sold. We will use approximately 50% of the net proceeds to 
acquire Troy Savings. 

We also intend to use a portion of the remainder of those net proceeds to fund 
a loan to our employee stock ownership plan to enable the plan to purchase our 
stock. The plan will purchase our stock in the subscription offering, or in the 
open market to the extent stock is not available due to oversubscription. We

If our appraised market value increases and we are required to sell 11,730,575 
shares of stock, then we estimate the net proceeds to be $114.7 million. If our 
appraised market value is increased and we sell 11,730,575 shares of stock and 
contribute 408,446 shares to the Troy Savings Bank Community Foundation, then 
our loan to the employee stock ownership plan would be $9.7 million. 

If we establish a long-term equity compensation plan, we may choose to fund the 
plan with cash to enable the plan to purchase shares of our stock. At this 
time, we have not made a determination regarding the funding of that benefit 
plan. We will invest the remaining net proceeds in short-term securities and 
deposit accounts, and otherwise use those proceeds for general corporate 
purposes. 

We also plan to establish or acquire a commercial bank and trust company that 
can accept municipal deposits to complement Troy Savings' municipal investment 
activities. If we establish a new bank, we plan to invest at least 
approximately $2 million of capital. This capital infusion would still count as 
our capital on a consolidated basis. If we acquire a bank, the cost will depend 
primarily upon the value of the assets and liabilities of the specific bank to 
be acquired. In addition, we may also consider acquisitions of other financial 
services firms and branch offices, although at this time, we do not have any 
agreements regarding any proposed transactions."

stock, the maximum of the range of initial public offering prices set forth on
the cover page of this prospectus, we estimate that, after deducting
underwriting discounts and expenses, we will receive net proceeds from the
initial public offering of ZDNet stock, of $172.5 million, or $199.0 million if
the underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares. We
will attribute the net proceeds from 1.5 million shares to ZDNet (estimated to
be approximately $25.9 million), in a manner analogous to a primary offering of
common stock. We will attribute the net proceeds from the remaining shares to
ZD (estimated to be approximately $146.6 million, or $173.1 million if the
underwriters fully exercise their overallotment option), in a manner analogous
to a secondary offering of common stock of a subsidiary owned by a parent.
ZDNet will advance to ZD the net proceeds attributed to ZDNet, and ZD will use
those net proceeds, together with the net proceeds attributed to ZD, to reduce
outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. The indebtedness
owed under our revolving credit facility was, at March 23, 1999, $230 million,
bore interest at that time at a weighted average interest rate of approximately
7.932% based on various LIBOR rates and matures on March 31, 2005. The advance
of cash by ZDNet to ZD will be treated as an inter-group revolving credit
advance and will bear interest at the rate at which we could borrow such funds
on a revolving credit basis. Since that rate is based on a spread to LIBOR
rates as in effect from time to time, it is not possible to quantify the
interest rate in advance."

(1) The Niki Taylor License (as hereinafter defined) provides for advance 
payments against future royalties, of which $100,000 remains outstanding and 
payable by the Company. This amount will be paid from the proceeds of this 
Offering. The Company also previously advanced an aggregate of $134,000 to a 
company controlled by well-known model, Tyra Banks, pursuant to a license 
agreement and an agreement for the sale of calendars and electronic planners. 
Ms. Banks has claimed that the Company breached these agreements and has 
refused to perform under either agreement. Ms. Banks' company could bring an 
action against the Company for additional amounts allegedly owed under these 
agreements, in an approximate sum of $153,000, as a result of the Company's 
failure to pay such amount by September 15, 1998. If the Company agrees to 
settle any potential claims or is required to pay any additional amounts to Ms. 
Banks' company, such funds will paid from the proceeds of this Offering. In the 
event that the Company does not raise sufficient funds in this Offering to pay 
any such amounts, and does not raise additional funds, in a timely manner, or 
have cash available from operations, or otherwise, with which to make such 
payments, the Company would be required to either substantially reduce or 
terminate its operations. If the Company raises gross proceeds of at least 
$1,500,000, it may enter into licenses with additional models or celebrities 
which would require the payment of additional licensing fees. See ""Management's 
Plan of Operations - Cash Requirements"" and ""Business - Web Sites."" 

(2) These amounts include payment for photo sessions to take exclusive shots of 
models for use in connection with the Company's web sites and electronic 
planners, as well as for use in the Company's advertising and marketing 
materials. See ""Business - Web Sites,"" and "" Sources of Revenue -- Electronic 
Planners."" 

(3) Includes the Company's repayment of outstanding loans, in an aggregate 
principal amount of $405,000, to Peter Klamka, the Company's Chairman, 
President and Chief Executive Officer, upon the consummation of this Offering. 
This indebtedness is not due until the earlier of (i) the date that the Company 
has raised an aggregate of not less than $1,500,000 in one or more public 
offerings of any of its securities or (ii) May 2001. Also includes the 
Company's repayment of $56,250, plus interest at the rate of 8% per annum, to 
four individuals pursuant to promissory notes which were due and payable in 
July 1998. The Company intends to pay the principal and interest on this 
outstanding indebtedness from the proceeds of this Offering. There can be no 
assurance that one or more of the individuals holding such promissory notes 
will not declare the Company in default thereunder, and require the Company to 
immediately pay the entire amount of principal and interest outstanding. See 
""Certain Transactions."" 
(4) Reflects payments to a third party web designer. See ""Business - Design and

(5) Includes amounts payable to a public relations firm, which the Company has 
retained, and expenses relating to print and/or electronic advertising. See 
""Business - Sources of Revenue -- Advertising"" and "" - Marketing and Promotion 
-- Public Relations."" 

(6) The Company may use a portion of the proceeds allocated to working capital 
to pay salaries of non-executive employees. 

The foregoing represents the Company's current estimate of its allocation of 
the net proceeds of the Offering. This estimate is based on certain 
assumptions, including without limitation the growth in revenues derived from 
the ""Fashion House with Niki Taylor"" web site, as to which there can be no 
assurance. 

The amounts actually expended for each purpose set forth in ""Use of Proceeds"" 
may vary significantly in the event any of these assumptions prove inaccurate. 
The Company reserves the right to change its use of proceeds as unanticipated 
events may cause the Company to redirect its priorities and reallocate the 
proceeds accordingly. A portion of the proceeds may also be used to acquire or 
invest in complementary businesses or products. Although the Company evaluates 
potential acquisitions or businesses and products from time to time, there are 
no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any such 
acquisitions. 

Pending utilization, the net proceeds of the Offering will be invested in 
short-term, interest-bearing investments. 

Any additional proceeds received upon exercise of the 1997 Warrants, the 1998 
Warrants or options granted pursuant to the Option Plan will be added to 
working capital. There can be no assurance that the 1997 Warrants, the 1998 
Warrants or such options granted pursuant to the Option Plan will be exercised."

common stock offered by us are estimated to be $99,640,000 after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses 
payable by us. 

We have no current specific plans for the net proceeds from this offering. We 
generally intend to use the proceeds of this offering for the following: 

. expansion of our sales and marketing activities; 

. opening of additional data centers; 

. expansion of our international operations; and 

. working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

We have not yet determined the actual expected expenditures and thus cannot 
estimate the amounts to be used for each purpose discussed above. The amounts 
and timing of these expenditures will vary significantly depending on a number 
of factors, including, but not limited to, the amount of cash generated by our 
operations and the market response to the introduction of any new service 
offerings. 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to 
acquire or invest in businesses, products, services or technologies 
complementary to our current business, through mergers, acquisitions, joint 
ventures or otherwise. However, we have no specific agreements or commitments 
and are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to these

the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. We intend to invest the 
net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade 
securities pending the above uses. 

The principal purposes of this offering are: to create a public market for our 
common stock, to increase our visibility and credibility, to facilitate future 
access to the public capital markets and to obtain additional capital."

of Common Stock offered by the Company at an initial public offering price of 
$10.00 per share are estimated to be $11,747,500 and $6,827,500, respectively, 
after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company and 
payment of estimated commissions to Agents and including the additional capital 
contribution of $747,500 by the Class B Members. 

The Company plans to use the offering proceeds first to repay approximately $7 
million of bank indebtedness, which is an obligation of its Class A Members as 
of the date of this Prospectus and is accounted for as redeemable members' 
equity. The redeemable members' equity was contributed to fund a portion of the 
initial capitalization of the Company and was used to purchase the Tumbleweed 
business and assets in January 1995. The indebtedness bears interest at an 
annual rate equal to 0.25% above the lender's ""index rate."" The current 
interest rate is 8.75% per year, and the indebtedness matures on December 31, 
1998, which the Company expects would be extended by several months, if the 
offering has not been completed by that date. 

The Common Stock offered hereby is being sold on a ""best efforts"" basis. 
Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive the 
estimated $11,747,500 in net proceeds anticipated from this offering. If the 
minimum of 700,000 shares of Common Stock offered hereby are sold, the Company 
expects to use the approximately $6,827,500 in net offering proceeds, together 
with additional borrowings available under the Company's revolving credit 
facility, to repay the bank indebtedness currently recorded as redeemable 
members' equity of its Class A Members. See ""Capitalization"" and ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition -- 
Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

If 1,200,000 shares are sold in the offering, the Company expects to use the 
net proceeds remaining after the repayment of the bank indebtedness currently 
recorded as redeemable members' equity of its Class A Members, which remaining 
amount is estimated to be approximately $4,668,000, to repay the outstanding 
balance of the Company's revolving credit facility, which totaled approximately 
$3,182,000 at June 30, 1998. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital 
Resources."" The Company's primary intended use of the remaining net proceeds, 
together with cash from operations and borrowings, is to finance the 
development of additional restaurants. The Company may also use net proceeds to 
buy out certain restaurant leases, should management conclude that such a buy-
out would be a cost-effective use of the Company's financial resources, and for 
working capital and general corporate purposes. See ""Certain Transactions -- 
Leases With Affiliates."" Pending such uses, the proceeds will be invested in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. 

If 700,000 or more, but fewer than 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock offered 
hereby are sold, the Company will be unable to fund all the intended uses 
described herein from the net proceeds anticipated from this offering without 
obtaining funds from alternative sources or by using working capital generated 
by the Company. Alternative sources of funds may not be available to the 
Company at a cost management believes is reasonable, and the amount of working 
capital generated internally by the Company may not be sufficient to finance 
any intended uses not funded by offering proceeds. To the extent that the 
Company receives less than the $11,747,500 in net proceeds after the payment of 
all expenses related to the offering hereby, the Company will first use any net 
proceeds to repay the bank indebtedness currently recorded as redeemable 
members' equity of its Class A Members. The remaining portion of the net 
offering proceeds, if any, will be used for such of the other purposes 
described above as the Company's management, in its discretion, deems 
appropriate. 



The following table sets forth the Company's anticipated use of the net 
offering proceeds, assuming the sale of 700,000 and 1,200,000 shares of Common 
Stock, respectively.

development of additional restaurants. The Company may also use net proceeds to 
buy out certain restaurant leases, should management conclude that such a buy-
out would be a cost-effective use of the Company's financial resources, and for 
working capital and general corporate purposes. See ""Certain Transactions -- 
Leases With Affiliates."" Pending such uses, the proceeds will be invested in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. 

If 700,000 or more, but fewer than 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock offered 
hereby are sold, the Company will be unable to fund all the intended uses 
described herein from the net proceeds anticipated from this offering without 
obtaining funds from alternative sources or by using working capital generated 
by the Company. Alternative sources of funds may not be available to the 
Company at a cost management believes is reasonable, and the amount of working 
capital generated internally by the Company may not be sufficient to finance 
any intended uses not funded by offering proceeds. To the extent that the 
Company receives less than the $11,747,500 in net proceeds after the payment of 
all expenses related to the offering hereby, the Company will first use any net 
proceeds to repay the bank indebtedness currently recorded as redeemable 
members' equity of its Class A Members. The remaining portion of the net 
offering proceeds, if any, will be used for such of the other purposes 
described above as the Company's management, in its discretion, deems 
appropriate.

of Common Stock offered by the Company at an initial public offering price of 
$10.00 per share are estimated to be $11,747,500 and $6,827,500, respectively, 
after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company and 
payment of estimated commissions to Agents and including the additional capital 
contribution of $747,500 by the Class B Members. 

The Company plans to use the offering proceeds first to repay approximately $7 
million of bank indebtedness, which is an obligation of its Class A Members as 
of the date of this Prospectus and is accounted for as redeemable members' 
equity. The redeemable members' equity was contributed to fund a portion of the 
initial capitalization of the Company and was used to purchase the Tumbleweed 
business and assets in January 1995. The indebtedness bears interest at an 
annual rate equal to 0.25% above the lender's ""index rate."" The current 
interest rate is 8.75% per year, and the indebtedness matures on December 31, 
1998, which the Company expects would be extended by several months, if the 
offering has not been completed by that date.

Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive the 
estimated $11,747,500 in net proceeds anticipated from this offering. If the

facility, to repay the bank indebtedness currently recorded as redeemable 
members' equity of its Class A Members. See ""Capitalization"" and ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition -- 
Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

If 1,200,000 shares are sold in the offering, the Company expects to use the 
net proceeds remaining after the repayment of the bank indebtedness currently 
recorded as redeemable members' equity of its Class A Members, which remaining 
amount is estimated to be approximately $4,668,000, to repay the outstanding 
balance of the Company's revolving credit facility, which totaled approximately 
$3,182,000 at June 30, 1998. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital

TUMBLEWEED INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tumbleweed-inc-3378-5147,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tumbleweed-inc-3378-5147,424B3,4/1/1999,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=571266,"The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of 1,200,000 and 700,000 shares 
of Common Stock offered by the Company at an initial public offering price of 
$10.00 per share are estimated to be $11,747,500 and $6,827,500, respectively, 
after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company and 
payment of estimated commissions to Agents and including the additional capital 
contribution of $747,500 by the Class B Members. 

The Company plans to use the offering proceeds first to repay approximately $7 
million of bank indebtedness, which is an obligation of its Class A Members as 
of the date of this Prospectus and is accounted for as redeemable members' 
equity. The redeemable members' equity was contributed to fund a portion of the 
initial capitalization of the Company and was used to purchase the Tumbleweed 
business and assets in January 1995. The indebtedness bears interest at an 
annual rate equal to 0.25% above the lender's ""index rate."" The current 
interest rate is 8.75% per year, and the indebtedness matures on December 31, 
1998, which the Company expects would be extended by several months, if the 
offering has not been completed by that date. 

The Common Stock offered hereby is being sold on a ""best efforts"" basis. 
Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive the 
estimated $11,747,500 in net proceeds anticipated from this offering. If the 
minimum of 700,000 shares of Common Stock offered hereby are sold, the Company 
expects to use the approximately $6,827,500 in net offering proceeds, together 
with additional borrowings available under the Company's revolving credit 
facility, to repay the bank indebtedness currently recorded as redeemable 
members' equity of its Class A Members. See ""Capitalization"" and ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition -- 
Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

If 1,200,000 shares are sold in the offering, the Company expects to use the 
net proceeds remaining after the repayment of the bank indebtedness currently 
recorded as redeemable members' equity of its Class A Members, which remaining 
amount is estimated to be approximately $4,668,000, to repay the outstanding 
balance of the Company's revolving credit facility, which totaled approximately 
$3,182,000 at June 30, 1998. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital 
Resources."" The Company's primary intended use of the remaining net proceeds, 
together with cash from operations and borrowings, is to finance the 
development of additional restaurants. The Company may also use net proceeds to 
buy out certain restaurant leases, should management conclude that such a buy-
out would be a cost-effective use of the Company's financial resources, and for 
working capital and general corporate purposes. See ""Certain Transactions -- 
Leases With Affiliates."" Pending such uses, the proceeds will be invested in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. 

If 700,000 or more, but fewer than 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock offered 
hereby are sold, the Company will be unable to fund all the intended uses 
described herein from the net proceeds anticipated from this offering without 
obtaining funds from alternative sources or by using working capital generated 
by the Company. Alternative sources of funds may not be available to the 
Company at a cost management believes is reasonable, and the amount of working 
capital generated internally by the Company may not be sufficient to finance 
any intended uses not funded by offering proceeds. To the extent that the 
Company receives less than the $11,747,500 in net proceeds after the payment of 
all expenses related to the offering hereby, the Company will first use any net 
proceeds to repay the bank indebtedness currently recorded as redeemable 
members' equity of its Class A Members. The remaining portion of the net 
offering proceeds, if any, will be used for such of the other purposes 
described above as the Company's management, in its discretion, deems 
appropriate.

offering will be $52,080,000. We intend to use all of the net proceeds to repay 
a portion of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility, which 
we expect will provide additional borrowing capacity for working capital and 
general corporate purposes. At December 26, 1998, the outstanding balance under 
the credit facility was approximately $124.8 million. Outstanding balances 
under the credit facility bear interest, at our election, of either the prime 
rate plus a margin ranging from 0% to 0.5% or the Euro Dollar Rate (as defined 
in the credit facility) plus a margin ranging from 2% to 2.75%. At December 26, 
1998, the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit 
facility was approximately 7.59%. The credit facility expires in May 2001, 
unless extended by the parties, and upon such expiration all outstanding 
amounts are then due."

 from this offering. This amount reflects deductions from the gross proceeds of
 the offering of: 
. approximately $12.6 million, which will be retained by the underwriters as 
discounts and commissions; 
. $10.0 million, representing our estimated expenses for this offering and the
 acquisitions of the 17 ISPs; and 
. $1,017,000 including accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 
7.75%, as repayment of two loans made to us to fund pre-offering expenses. 
We will use approximately $71.8 million of the net proceeds to pay the cash 
portion of the purchase prices payable in the acquisitions of our 17 ISPs. We
 will use an additional $6.4 million of the net proceeds to pay off indebtedness 
and liabilities of the ISPs, including amounts due to affiliates. This indebtedness 
bears interest at a weighted average rate of 8.4% and matures over four years. 
We will use the remainder of the net proceeds, approximately $85.2 million, for
 general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions, working capital 
and the payment of any additional amounts payable to former owners of our ISPs 
under the earn-out provisions of the acquisition agreements. This use of proceeds 
does not reflect the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. We 
estimate that we will receive $26.2 million in additional net proceeds if the

prospectus and in the concurrent placement, after deducting underwriting discounts 
and the estimated offering expenses payable by MiningCo, are estimated to be 
approximately $70.9 million ($81.3 million if the underwriters' over-allotment
 option is exercised in full). The principal purposes of this offering are to
 obtain additional capital, to create a public market for the common stock and 
to facilitate future access by MiningCo to public securities markets. 
MiningCo intends to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent 
placement to execute its business plan. As part of this plan, MiningCo expects
 to increase its sales and marketing efforts and hire additional internal advertising 
sales personnel. In addition, MiningCo expects to use a portion of the proceeds 
to fund its capital expenditures. MiningCo estimates that its capital expenditures 
will be approximately $4.0 million for 1999, which is expected to be used for
 technical infrastructure improvements and for the expansion of MiningCo's office 
space. While MiningCo may also use a portion of the proceeds for acquisitions, 
MiningCo has no present understandings or agreements relating to any acquisitions. 
Other than with respect to its expected capital expenditures, MiningCo has not 
yet determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for any of the
 other foregoing purposes. Accordingly, management will have significant flexibility 
in applying a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering and the
 concurrent placement. Pending any such use, as described above, MiningCo intends 
to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing instruments."

determined until the Reorganization is completed, the net proceeds are expected 
to range from $6,551,250 to $10,484,810. See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The 
Reorganization Stock - Pricing and Number of Shares to be Issued"" for a 
discussion of the assumptions used to estimate those amounts. The proceeds will 
not be available unless and until the Reorganization is completed. 

The Company will purchase the capital stock of the Bank for 50% of the net 
proceeds from the sale of Common Stock in the Reorganization. Therefore, it is 
estimated that the amount paid by the Company to the Bank, before non-cash 
accounting adjustments, will range from $3.3 million to $5.2 million. The Bank 
intends to invest its share of the net proceeds in short- and medium-term, 
investment grade debt securities. The amount received will become part of the 
Bank's general funds, which the Bank currently intends to gradually deploy to 
increase its levels of one-to-four family real estate loans, auto loans, 
commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans, depending on market conditions 
as suitable opportunities arise. The Company expects that initially it will use 
the net proceeds remaining in its hands, after funding the loan to the ESOP, to 
make investments in short and intermediate term investment-grade debt 
securities. The Company may also use the proceeds it retains to purchase stock 
to fund the Restricted Stock Plan or to satisfy the exercise of options issued 
under the Stock Option Plan. Those purchases would generally not occur for at 
least six months after the Reorganization and generally not until after the 
Public Stockholders approve the two plans. See ""Management of the Bank - 
Benefits - Stock Option Plan"" and ""- Restricted Stock Plan."" 

If the ESOP purchases 8% of the stock sold to Public Stockholders in the 
Reorganization at a price of $5.00 per share, the ESOP loan will be from 
$566,100 to $880,780, depending upon the number of shares sold in the 
Reorganization. The Company estimates that the term of the ESOP loan will be 
ten years. The Company and the Bank may choose to use a loan from an 
independent third party to fund the ESOP's stock purchase, but that is not 
presently anticipated. See ""Management of the Bank Benefits - Employee Stock 
Ownership Plan."" 

The Bank or the Company may use the net proceeds from the Reorganization to 
support future expansion through, for example, purchasing branches, 
establishing new branches, acquiring other financial institutions, or expanding 
into other banking related businesses. The Company and the Bank have no current 
arrangements, understandings or agreements for any such expansion but the 
Company and the Bank intend to actively seek such acquisitions after the 
Reorganization is completed. The Company, after the Reorganization, will be 
permitted to engage in only those activities which are permitted for a multiple 
savings and loan holding company. In general, a multiple savings and loan 
holding company can only engage in the activities permitted for a bank holding 
company (generally defined as activities which are closely related to banking) 
plus certain additional activities permitted by OTS regulation. See ""Regulation 
- Holding Company Regulation."" 

After the Reorganization, the Board of Directors of the Company may approve 
stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements, and 
use a portion of the net proceeds to implement those repurchase plans. Unless 
approved by the OTS, the Company may not repurchase any Common Stock in the 
first year after the Reorganization and, during the next two years, may only 
repurchase up to 5% of its outstanding capital stock each year. Further, the 
Company may not repurchase any of its Common Stock if the repurchase would 
cause the Bank to become ""undercapitalized."" See ""Regulation - Regulation of 
Federal Savings Association-Prompt Corrective Action."" The Board of Directors 
may authorize the use of a portion of the net proceeds to repurchase stock 
depending upon facts and circumstances in the future. Such facts and 
circumstances may include, for example: (i) market and economic factors such as 
the price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, 
the attractiveness of other investment alternatives, the ability to increase 
the book value and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, 
and the opportunity to improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) avoiding 
dilution by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) capital needs 
of the Company and the Bank in light of the level of non-performing loans, 
current and projected results of operations, the economic environment and other 
considerations. If the Company repurchases stock for more than book value per 
share, the book value per share for remaining shares would be reduced. The 
Company will not repurchase any stock if the repurchase would cause the Company

repay $225,000 in bridge financing loaned at interest rates between 10% and 
12% per annum on or about January, 1999; $25,000 will be used to repay Everette 
Hinson, a Company affiliate, which was loaned on or about August, 1998 at an 
interest rate of 12.5%; the remainder will be used to negotiate settlements of 
$625,000 of indebtedness consisting of $375,000 of bridge debts which matured 
either on September 30, 1998 or October 15, 1998 and $250,000 of debt that

(2) Of the $500,000 allocated for advertising and marketing, approximately 
$350,000 will be used in the production of a Tegra driver infomercial and 
related marketing materials; $100,000 will be used for the initial purchase of 
media time; and $50,000 will be used on tour endorsements. 

(3) The $200,000 for the purchase of inventory will be primarily spent on the 
production of Tegra drivers. 

(4) Includes payroll and benefits, rent, utilities, acquisition of inventory, 
distribution costs, manufacturing costs, advertising costs, other overhead 
expenses and prepaid expenses to underwriters. 

If the Underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full, the Company 
will realize additional net proceeds of approximately $307,980, which will be 
added to the Company's working capital. 

The allocation of proceeds described in ""Use of Proceeds"" represents the 
Company's best estimate of its allocation based upon the current state of its 
business, operations and plans, current business conditions and the Company's 
evaluation of its industry. Future events, including problems, delays, expenses 
and complications which may be encountered, changes in economic or competitive 
conditions and the result of the Company's sales and marketing activities may 
make shifts in the allocation of funds necessarily desirable. Management of the 
Company will have broad discretion in the application of substantially all of 
such proceeds. See ""Risk Factors."" 

The Company's financial requirements will depend upon, among other things, the 
growth rate of the Company's business, the amount of cash flow generated by 
operations and the company's ability to borrow funds to produce inventory or 
for working capital purposes. Should the Company require additional debt or 
equity financing to support its operations, there can be no assurance that such 
additional financing will be available to the Company on commercially 
reasonable terms, or at all. 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest 
bearing investments. 

The Company anticipates that the proceeds, if any, received from any exercise 
of the Underwriters' Warrants will be utilized for working capital and other 
corporate purposes."

(1) Consists of $160,000 in salaries and benefits (estimated through Albany 
Bank's target opening date in April 1999), $100,000 in legal and professional 
fees and $40,000 in other pre-opening expenses. As of December 31, 1998, 
Community Capital had paid approximately $250,000 of these expenses. 

We plan to use any working capital that Community Capital does not use to 
capitalize Albany Bank principally to build additional branches at a cost of 
approximately $500,000 to $800,000 per branch and to maintain appropriate 
liquidity. We plan to use any amounts not applied to expansion or liquidity to 
pay operating expenses, provide additional capital for Albany Bank, purchase 
certificates of deposit of Albany Bank to the extent we deem necessary and for 
other general purposes. Our anticipated allocation of working capital could 
change if we are unable to obtain suitable sites for new branches at a 
reasonable price or if we are faced with unexpected liquidity issues.

 described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-

 and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. 
The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our equity capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate future access by us
' to public equity markets and to provide increased visibility of FlashNet in a
 marketplace where many of our competitors are publicly-held companies. We 
currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 
- Approximately $12.0 million for the expansion of our sales and marketing 
operations; 
- Repayment of $6.5 million in principal amount of a Secured Promissory Note
 issued to Ascend Communications, Inc.; 
- Approximately $5.0 million to expand our network infrastructure; 
- Repayment of $5.0 million in principal amount of a Term Note issued to Goldman
 Sachs Credit Partners L.P.; 
- Approximately $2.0 million to develop further our business services offerings; and 
- The balance for working capital, general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions.
The Ascend promissory note matures upon consummation of this offering and bears interest
 at 6.0% per annum. At December 31, 1998, the amount outstanding under the 
Ascend promissory note was $6.5 million. The Term Note issued to Goldman Sachs 
Credit Partners L.P. matures on January 15, 2000 and bears interest at 13% per
 annum until July 15, 1999, at which time, if the Term Note is not fully repaid,
 the interest rate will increase, retroactively, to 15.5%. Other than $6.5 million 
for repayment of the Ascend promissory note and $5.0 million for repayment of the
 Term Note issued to Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., we have not allocated
 specific dollar amounts for the above mentioned uses of proceeds. Potential 
acquisitions may include acquisitions of businesses, subscriber accounts, products
 and technologies, or participation in joint venture arrangements, that are 
complementary to our business and service offerings. Although we have not identified 
any specific businesses, subscriber accounts, products, technologies or joint
 ventures that we may acquire or enter into, nor are there any current agreements 
or negotiations with respect to any such transactions, we evaluate such opportunities 
from time to time. Pending such uses, the net proceeds will be invested in 
government securities and other short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
 instruments."

(1) Represents the approximate amount that may be used to fund the potential 
acquisition of businesses in accordance with the Company's current strategy 
which is subject to change from time to time. 

(2) Represents the approximate amount that may be used to expand Eagle's, JEH 
Eagle's and MSI Eagle's operations which is subject to change from time to 
time. The Company estimates that the foregoing allocation will be sufficient to 
enable Eagle, JEH Eagle and MSI Eagle to establish approximately six new 
distribution centers and will be used principally to carry accounts receivable 
and purchase inventory. The foregoing allocation excludes the purchase of 
trucks, forklifts and similar equipment identified in note (4). 

(3) To be used to (i) prepay the unpaid principal and interest due 
(approximately $1,470,000), at the time of such payment, to MSI Co. pursuant to 
the five-year note issued by MSI Eagle in October 1998 to MSI Co. in connection 
with MSI Eagle's acquisition of the business and substantially all of the 
assets of MSI Co. then in the principal amount of $2,046,000, subject to 
adjustment, bearing interest at the rate of 8% per year; and (ii) reduce 
Eagle's and JEH Eagle's outstanding balances of borrowings under their credit 
facilities by approximately $1,315,000 for each facility. At October 31, 1998, 
Eagle had borrowed approximately $8,748,000 under its credit facility. During 
Eagle's June 30, 1995 fiscal year, Eagle used its borrowings under its credit 
facility to repay approximately $2,326,000 of its indebtedness to TDA and to 
advance approximately $3,309,000 to TDA. The remainder of the outstanding 
balance of the credit facility was used to fund continuing operations. At 
October 31, 1998, JEH Eagle had borrowed approximately $13,106,000 under its 
credit facility. The Eagle and JEH Eagle borrowings that will be reduced under 
the credit facilities, currently bear interest at the rate of 7.45% per year. 
Each of Eagle's and JEH Eagle's credit facilities mature in October 2003. See 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""The Acquisitions."" 

(4) To be used for leasehold improvements for existing distribution centers and 
to purchase, if necessary, trucks, forklifts and similar equipment to support 
additional distribution centers for Eagle, JEH Eagle and MSI Eagle. 

(5) To be used to repay approximately $525,000 in principal and interest on 
borrowings of $300,000 made by the Company in February 1998 pursuant to 
promissory notes issued to TDA ($150,000) and two other stockholders of the 
Company, and on borrowings made by the Company in August 1998 and January 1999 
pursuant to promissory notes issued to TDA each in the principal amount of 
$100,000. The February 1998 notes bear interest at the rate of 15% per year 
through June 30, 1998 and 6% per year after that date. The February 1998 notes 
mature on the earlier of thirty months after issuance or the closing of the 
Public Offering. The notes issued to TDA in August 1998 and January 1999 bear 
interest at the rate of 6% per year and mature on the earlier of two years 
after issuance or the closing of the Public Offering. The proceeds from the 
issuance of the foregoing notes have and are being used to pay certain expenses 
relating to the Public Offering, legal fees and expenses in connection with 
seeking the listing of the Company's securities on NASDAQ and the Acquisitions. 
The Company currently estimates that the net proceeds of the Public Offering 
will be sufficient to fund its planned operations, including the cash portion 
of potential acquisitions, if any, and expansion efforts for approximately 
twelve to twenty-four months from the date of this Prospectus. The net proceeds 
may be sufficient for a greater or lesser period of time depending on the 
extent of the Company's expansion efforts and on the number of acquisitions, if 
any, that the Company consummates during the next twelve to twenty-four months 
and the portion of the purchase price of such acquisitions paid in cash. In 
addition, the Company may require additional financing prior to or following 
such period if Eagle, JEH Eagle or MSI Eagle suffer losses or if the Company 
effects the acquisition of a business that subsequently suffers losses. The 
Company has no commitments or arrangements for any such additional financing, 
and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain 
additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. If required, 
the Company may seek to finance the purchase price of acquisitions by purchase 
money indebtedness, asset-based financing and/or issuances of its own 
securities; and to open additional Eagle, JEH Eagle and MSI Eagle distribution 
centers by obtaining short-term vendor inventory financing (inventory purchased 
on extended payment terms), asset-based financing and/ or equipment leasing/
financing. As each potential acquisition will be individually negotiated, the 
Company is unable to estimate the cash or other portions of a potential 
acquisition's purchase price. In the event additional financing is unavailable 
to the Company, the Company may be materially adversely affected. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Public Offering. Future events, as well as changes in 
economic, regulatory or competitive conditions or the Company's business or 
Eagle's, JEH Eagle's or MSI Eagle's business and the results of the Company's, 
Eagle's, JEH Eagle's or MSI Eagle's activities may make shifts in the 
allocation of funds within the described categories or to other purposes 
necessary or desirable. In the event the Company is unable to fund the cash 
portion of potential acquisitions with the net proceeds allocated above, 
Eagle, JEH Eagle or MSI Eagle suffer losses or the Company completes an 
acquisition that subsequently suffers losses, the Company may draw upon the net
 proceeds of the Public Offering allocated to expand the number of Eagle's, JEH 
Eagle's or MSI Eagle's distribution centers, purchase equipment to support that 
expansion and/or working capital. The Company estimates that the net proceeds 
of the Public Offering allocated to expand the number of Eagle's, JEH Eagle's 
and MSI Eagle's distribution centers and to support that expansion will be 
sufficient to establish approximately six new distribution centers at an 
average cost of approximately $415,000 for each new distribution center. In the 
event the per distribution center costs are greater than estimated, Eagle, JEH 
Eagle and MSI Eagle may establish less than six new distribution centers, the 
Company may seek vendor financing of inventory, asset-based financing and/or 
equipment leasing/financing, or draw upon the net proceeds of the Public 
Offering allocated to working capital. In the event the per distribution center 
costs are less than estimated, a portion of the net proceeds of the Public 
Offering allocated for such purposes will be reallocated to finance 
acquisitions or for working capital. In order to conduct its proposed 
expansion, the Company intends to use a significant portion of the net proceeds 
of the Public Offering for the acquisition of businesses or assets that are 
consistent with the Company's current strategy, which is subject to change from 
time to time. With the exception of the Acquisitions, the Company does not 
currently have any agreements, commitments or arrangements with respect to any 
proposed acquisitions nor has it identified or negotiated with any potential 
acquisition candidates, and there can be no assurance that any acquisitions 
will be consummated. Except for the Acquisitions, the Company has no present 
intention to use the net proceeds of the Public Offering to acquire assets from 
any of its affiliates. 
Prior to expenditure, proceeds will be invested principally in high grade, 
short-term, interest-bearing investments. Any proceeds received upon exercise 
of the Overallotment Option or any of the Warrants will be used to finance 
potential acquisitions or for working capital. There can be no assurance that
 the Overallotment Option or any of the Warrants will be exercised."

by RoweCom. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to: 

. finance the expansion of RoweCom's business and to increase available working 
capital; 

. create a public market for the common stock; 

. facilitate future access by RoweCom to public equity markets; and

functionality for the kStore, increase content available through the kStore by 
increasing our content acquisition staff, and enhance our technical 
infrastructure, including by developing redundant systems. 

We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds of the offering for working 
capital and general corporate purposes, including making capital expenditures 
in the ordinary course of our business. We may also apply a portion of the net 
proceeds of the offering to acquire businesses, products and technologies that 
are complementary to ours. Although we have not identified any specific 
businesses, products or technologies that we may acquire and have not entered 
into any current agreements or negotiations with respect to any such 
transactions, we evaluate such opportunities from time to time. Pending such 
uses, the net proceeds will be invested in government securities and other 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

The Company intends to use approximately $4.8 million of the net proceeds of 
the Offering to repay notes payable to the Company's lenders (the ""Bank 
Notes""), which were issued in connection with the acquisitions of Ventura and 
MIM and for general corporate purposes. The Bank Notes bear interest at an 
average blended rate of 8.0% per annum, become due at various times through 
2004 and may be prepaid at anytime without premium or penalty.

indebtedness to Dr. Markovitz incurred in connection with the Company's 
purchase of the stock of MCM Plaza, a company wholly owned by Dr. Markovitz, 
and $0.2 million to repay indebtedness to Dr. Markovitz incurred in connection 
with the PrimeTech acquisition (such amounts, together with the Distribution

The Company intends to use the remaining $6.3 million of the net proceeds of

program development at existing campuses, the addition of new campuses and the 
possible acquisition of additional businesses that are consistent with the 
Company's mission of providing academically-oriented, practitioner-focused 
education in fields with numerous employment opportunities and strong student 
demand. The Company currently has no agreements, understandings or commitments

a public market for the common stock and facilitate future access to public 
markets. The net proceeds to priceline.com from the sale of the 10,000,000 
shares of common stock offered hereby are estimated to be approximately $146.6 
million after deducting estimated offering expenses of $2.2 million and the 
underwriting discount payable by priceline.com. Priceline.com intends to use 
the net proceeds, over time, for general corporate purposes, including working 
capital to fund anticipated operating losses, expenses associated with its 
advertising campaigns, brand-name promotions and other marketing efforts and 
capital expenditures. Priceline.com also could use a portion of the net 
proceeds, currently intended for general corporate purposes, to acquire or 
invest in businesses, technologies, products or services, although no specific 
acquisitions are planned and no portion of the net proceeds has been allocated 
for any acquisition. 

As of the date of this prospectus, priceline.com cannot specify with certainty 
the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the consummation 
of this offering. Accordingly, priceline.com's management will have broad 
discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending such uses, 
priceline.com intends to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-
term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. See ""Risk Factors -- We 
May Be Unable to Meet Our Future Capital Requirements"" and ""Risk Factors -- Our

($18,480,000) from our sale of the 2,200,000 ADSs offered by this prospectus, 
at the initial public offering price of L6.01 ($10.00) per ADS. If the 
underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option, we will receive net 
proceeds of approximately L12,880,081 ($21,417,000). That amount is after 
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and other fees and 
expenses payable by us. 

We expect to use approximately L10,066,783 ($16,739,000) of the net proceeds to 
facilitate the roll out of the TownPages service in the United Kingdom and 
related operations over the 12 months following completion of the offering in 
the event we do not generate revenues from operations or obtain bank financing. 
We intend to use approximately L1,047,000 ($1,741,000) of the net proceeds to 
retire indebtedness, unless we refinance our indebtedness upon the completion 
of this offering. The balance of the net proceeds, if any, including any 
amounts not used to repay indebtedness, will be used for general corporate 
purposes. 

To achieve our expansion and growth plans, we may also use a portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire or invest in companies, technologies or expertise 
complementary to our business. From time to time we evaluate potential 
acquisitions of companies, technologies and expertise. We have no agreements 
for acquisitions or investments of that nature at this time. 

We currently intend to use funds for the expansion of the TownPages service 
primarily for the following purposes: 

- hiring and training additional marketing, sales, design, technical, and 
administrative personnel; 

- purchasing and installing approximately 3,450 touch-screen public 
information point kiosks in the targeted towns and cities during the next three 
years; 

- introducing and incorporating into TownPages additional internal and external 
Web sites offering new information and services; 

- enhancing our server and networking infrastructure; and 

- sales and marketing campaigns. 

The proposed allocation of the net proceeds of the offering represents our 
management's best estimate of and current intention concerning the expected use 
of funds to finance our activities in accordance with our management's current 
objectives and market conditions. Our management and board of directors may 
allocate the funds in significantly different proportions depending upon their 
assessment of our needs at the time. Pending use of funds as described above, 
we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade, interest-bearing 
securities in the United Kingdom. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operation--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

Our working capital is currently provided pursuant to a discretionary secured 
operating line of credit for our operating subsidiary, Town Pages UK Limited, 
with Glen Investments Limited. Kevin R. Leech, a member of our board of 
directors and the principal beneficial owner of our ordinary shares, is the 
beneficial owner of 100% of the outstanding share capital of Glen Investments 
Limited. Advances under the line of credit bear interest at 9% per annum, are 
payable on demand, and are secured by a first security interest in all assets 
and property of Town Pages UK Limited, our operating subsidiary. At December 
31, 1998, Town Pages UK Limited owed approximately L1.8 million ($3.0 million) 
inclusive of interest, under the line of credit. Upon completion of the 
offering, L850,000 ($1,413,380), of the amount outstanding to Glen Investments 
Limited, including interest, will be converted into 850,000 shares of our 9% 
Series A preferred shares. The balance of the outstanding loans and 
indebtedness will be repaid from the net proceeds of this offering or will be 
refinanced. We are seeking to establish a new credit facility from a commercial 
lender effective upon completion of this offering of up to L3.0 million ($5.0 
million). We contemplate that any new line of credit shall be secured by a 
first security interest in all of our assets and advances under that line of 
credit shall be based upon agreed upon percentages of our eligible accounts 
receivable. As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have a commitment from 
any lender for a proposed credit facility. See ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and 
Capital Resources"" and ""Related Party Transactions."" 
Our management believes that the net proceeds of this offering, together with 
revenues from current contracts and with borrowings under the contemplated 
credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our projected cash needs through at 
least the next 12 months. Also, our management believes that the net proceeds 
of this offering, together with anticipated revenues from our operations and 
borrowings under the contemplated credit facility, will be sufficient to meet 
our projected cash needs through the next 36 months. However, there is no 
assurance that we will achieve projected revenues, that bank borrowings will be 
available to us on commercially attractive terms or at all, or that the costs 
actually incurred to expand TownPages over the next three years will not exceed 
our budget. Also, if we elect to expand our operations outside the United 
Kingdom or to add services or other capabilities not presently contemplated in 
our three year plan, either alone or with a strategic partner, the net proceeds 
from this offering and any available bank borrowings may be insufficient to 
meet our capital requirements for that expansion. If additional funds are 
required for any of those reasons, we would be unable to complete our expansion 
as planned and our business and financial condition would be seriously 
adversely affected if we are unable to raise additional funds on acceptable 
terms, in timely fashion, or at all. There is no assurance that any additional 
financing will be available on commercially attractive terms, in timely 
fashion, in sufficient amounts, or at all."

purposes, including approximately $5.0 million for funding product development

organization. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for further

commissions and offering expenses payable by Razorfish. 

Razorfish expects to use such net proceeds for general corporate purposes, 
including: 

.expanding its human resources department and hiring additional personnel; 

.the development of a formal sales and marketing department; 

.strategic acquisitions or investments; 

.international expansion; 

.technical upgrades of internal systems; and 

.working capital requirements. 

Razorfish's management continually evaluates potential strategic acquisitions

commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition or investment. 
Pending such uses, Razorfish intends to invest the net proceeds from the 
offering in U.S. government securities and other investment-grade, interest-
bearing instruments. 

The foregoing represents Razorfish's present intentions with respect to the 
allocation of proceeds of this offering based upon its present plans and 
business conditions. The occurrence of certain unforeseen events or changed 
business conditions could result in the application of the proceeds of the 
offering in a manner other than as described in this prospectus. See ""Risk 
Factors--Our management has broad discretion over the use of proceeds from this

offered hereby by the Company, after deducting the underwriting discount and 
estimated offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately $42.7 million 
($50.9 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in 
full). The net proceeds of the Offering will be used to fund working capital 
and for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt, expenditures 
for the IGIS technology enhancements, funding the continuing development of 
LeadersOnline, the possible opening of new offices and possible acquisitions. 
The Company expects to use the proceeds to repay debt as follows: (i) 
approximately $11.0 million will be used to repay the outstanding balance on 
H&S Inc.'s $60 million line of credit expiring on December 31, 2001 which bears 
interest at approximately 6.8%, (ii) approximately $3.9 million will be used to 
repay balances under HSI's $10.5 million line of credit expiring on July 1, 
2002 which bears interest at approximately 6.6%, and (iii) approximately $3.7 
million will be used to repay balances under HSI's line of credit expiring on 
May 31, 1999 and which bears interest at approximately 
4.6%. The Company also intends to use $3.8 million of the proceeds of the 
Offering to repay notes payable to certain former stockholders of H&S Inc. and 
HSI whose stock has been repurchased by H&S Inc. and HSI, respectively. The 
notes payable to such former stockholders are payable over four to five years 
and bear interest at the prime rate. The Company also expects to spend $16.3 
million of the proceeds of the Offering for the IGIS technology enhancements 
over the course of the year. Pending such uses, H&S intends to invest the net 
proceeds from the Offering in short-term, investment grade securities, 
certificates of deposit, or direct guaranteed obligations of the United States 
government. The borrowings under H&S Inc.'s and HSI's respective credit lines 
which are intended to be repaid were used to fund certain IGIS technology 
enhancements, acquisitions and the working capital needs of the Company. See

(1) Approximately $150,000 will be used to pay arrearages in research support 
due pursuant to the Consortium Agreement, as amended. 
(2) The Company intends to use $100,000 of the net proceeds to repay principal 
amounts due the State of Illinois, which amount is due pursuant to an unsecured 
promissory note of the Company, dated August 8, 1996, which matures upon 
completion of an initial public offering. The promissory note has accrued 
$281,470 in interest, which interest is payable at the option of the Company in 
shares of the Company's Common Stock upon completion of an initial public 
offering. Therefore, 28,147 shares of Common Stock will be issued to the State 
of Illinois upon completion of the Offerings (based upon an initial public 
offering price of $10.00 per Share) as consideration for interest accrued under 
the obligation. 

The amount and timing of expenditures of the net proceeds of the Offering 
cannot be precisely determined, and will depend on numerous factors, including 
the status of the Company's product development efforts, the results of 
clinical trials and the regulatory approval process. Pending such uses, the 
Company plans to invest the net proceeds from the Offerings in short-term, 
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. 

The Company estimates that its current cash resources and the net proceeds of 
the Offerings, not including any proceeds from any grant the Company may 
receive, will be sufficient to meet its operating and capital requirements for 
20 months following the closing of the Offerings. However, the Company's cash 
requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of 
research and development, results of preclinical and clinical testing, 
responses to the Company's grant requests, relationships with possible 
strategic partners, changes in the focus and direction of the Company's 
research and development programs, competitive and technological advances, the 
FDA regulatory process and other factors. Because of these contingencies, there 
can be no assurance that the net proceeds of the Offerings will satisfy the 
Company's requirements for any particular period of time. The Company 
anticipates that additional funding will be required after the use of the net 
proceeds of the Offerings. No assurance can be given that such additional 
financing will be available when needed on terms acceptable to the Company, if 
at all. See ""Risk Factors - Need for Substantial Additional Funds."" 

Proceeds, if any, derived from the exercise of the Underwriters' Warrants will 
be added to the Company's working capital. 

Although the Company intends to apply the net proceeds of the Offerings in the 
manner described herein, it has broad discretion within such proposed uses as 
to the precise allocation of the net proceeds, the timing of expenditures and 
other aspects of the use thereof. The Company reserves the right to reallocate 
the net proceeds of the Offerings among the various categories set forth in 
this section as it, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable. 
Although the Company does not currently anticipate any material changes to the 
allocations set forth, business requirements and market conditions that are not 
now able to be anticipated may require that proceeds be allocated in a 
different manner. For example, if an acquisition candidate were to become known 
to the Company and as analyses of the acquisition indicated that the 
transaction would be a benefit to the Company and its stockholders, the Company 
may pursue such a transaction and may be required to re-allocate proceeds from 
this Offering in order to complete the transaction."

million of common stock at the midpoint of the offering range, the contribution 
of shares to the foundation and the purchase of 8% of the shares by the employee
stock ownership plan, the following table sets forth the manner in which we will
use the net proceeds: 


Loan to employee stock ownership plan    $ 3,110,400

                                         ===========


 

The proceeds retained by 1st State Bancorp initially will be invested in short-
term and intermediate-term securities, including cash and cash equivalents and 
U.S. Government and agency obligations. The proceeds will be available for a 
variety of corporate purposes, including funding a restricted stock plan, if 
implemented, future acquisitions and diversification of business, additional 
capital contributions to 1st State Bank, dividends to stockholders and future 
repurchases of common stock. We do not have any specific plans, intentions, 
arrangements or understandings regarding acquisitions or capital contributions. 
We have provided in our internal business plan that we will repurchase 5% of 
the outstanding common stock in each of the second and third years following 
the conversion. However, whether we actually repurchase stock depends on many 
factors that may change during the next year or two. For example, we might not 
repurchase any stock if the prevailing market price was too high or if we had a 
better use for our excess liquid assets. In addition, we will have funds 
available to loan to 1st State Bank, if necessary, in the event and to the 
extent loan growth exceeds deposit growth or for other corporate purposes. 
We may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire shares of common stock 
pursuant to a restricted stock plan, if implemented, or to purchase shares to be
held by a grantor trust for issuance to option holders upon the exercise of 
options in the event a stock option plan is implemented. See ""Management of 1st 
State Bank -- Proposed Future Stock Benefit Plans -- Stock Option Plan"" and ""-- 
Restricted Stock Plan"" for a description of those plans. We do not have any 
specific plans regarding possible stock repurchases during the first year 
following the conversion. 

The proceeds we invest in 1st State Bank will become part of 1st State Bank's 
general corporate funds to be used for business activities, including making 
loans and investments. Initially, we expect that we will invest the proceeds in 
short-term and intermediate-term securities, including cash and cash equivalents
and U.S. Government and agency obligations. We ultimately plan to use the 
proceeds primarily to originate loans in the ordinary course of business."

CompuCredit expects to use the net proceeds from the offering to finance the 
growth of its business through the origination and purchase of credit card

In the event that the Company's plans change or its assumptions change or prove 
to be inaccurate or if the proceeds of the Offering prove insufficient to fund 
operations (due to unanticipated expenses or difficulties or otherwise), the 
Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds 
within the above-described categories or to use portions thereof for other 
purposes or may be required to seek additional financing or curtail its 
operations. Future events, including changes in economic or industry conditions 
or the Company's planned operations, may require the Company to reallocate 
proceeds among the various intended uses if it is determined at a later date 
that an increase in any expenditures or reallocation of proceeds is necessary 
or desirable. Any such determination would be based on, among other things, 
whether and to what extent revenue from sales is sufficient to offset operating 
expenses and the capital requirements associated with expanding its operations. 

The Company may, if and when the opportunity arises, use a portion of the 
proceeds of the Offering, possibly including a portion of the proceeds 
allocated to working capital, together with the issuance of debt or equity 
securities, to acquire rights to products. Any decision to make such an 
acquisition will be based upon a variety of factors, including, among others, 
the purchase price and other financial terms of the transaction. Potential 
acquisition candidates may include products that are compatible with the 
Company's products, or that the Company believes would provide the Company with 
additional distribution channels. As of the date of this Prospectus, the 
Company has no agreements, understandings or arrangements with respect to any 
such product acquisition and is not in the process of reviewing specific 
acquisition opportunities or engaged in negotiations with any potential 
acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able 
to successfully consummate any acquisition or successfully integrate any 
acquired product into its operations. Investors in the Offering will not have 
an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any acquisition. 
Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be 
invested in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

$17.0 million for brand promotion, customer acquisition, distribution 
agreements and related costs; and

The amounts actually expended for such purposes may vary significantly and will 
depend on a number of factors, including the amount of our future revenues and 
the other factors described under ""Risk Factors."" Accordingly, we will retain 
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. A 
portion of the net proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, product lines or products. We currently 
have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition, other 
than our pending acquisition of SW Networks. Pending such uses, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds of the offering in investment-grade, interest-bearing

(1) As part of the redemption of junior preferred stock, Lloyd Ross and Jerry 
Smith will receive $7.2 million. Upon receipt, Mr. Ross and Mr. Smith will pay 
an aggregate of $3.4 million to Tuesday Morning representing the outstanding 
balance of their loans. See ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."" 

The indenture establishing the terms of our senior subordinated notes allows us 
to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior 
subordinated notes within 20 days of any public equity offering at a redemption 
price equal to 111% of the principal amount, together with accrued interest. 
The indenture further provides that after giving effect to any redemption at 
least $65 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes 
must remain outstanding. Tuesday Morning sold $100 million of its senior 
subordinated notes in connection with the December 1997 recapitalization. The 
senior subordinated notes bear interest at 11% and will mature on December 15, 
2007. 

The certificate of designation establishing the terms of the senior 
exchangeable redeemable preferred stock allows Tuesday Morning to redeem at any 
time prior to December 15, 2001 all of these shares within 20 days of any 
public equity offering at a redemption price equal to 113.25% of these shares' 
aggregate liquidation preference, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends (or a 
redemption price of $113.25 per share at March 15, 1999). Tuesday Morning must 
redeem all of the outstanding shares of the senior exchangeable redeemable 
preferred stock on December 15, 2009. Dividends on the senior exchangeable 
preferred stock are payable at an annual rate of 13 1/4% of the liquidation 
preference per share. 

In March 1999, Tuesday Morning offered to exchange all of its shares of junior 
redeemable preferred stock and junior perpetual preferred stock for shares of 
its common stock, subject to the consummation of the offerings. Holders of 
$89.9 million of junior redeemable preferred stock and $0.6 million of junior 
perpetual preferred stock (such amounts representing these shares' liquidation 
value plus accrued but unpaid dividends) elected to exchange their shares of 
preferred stock for a number of shares of common stock equal to such amounts 
divided by the per share offering price of the common stock offered in the 
offerings, net of underwriting discount. Holders of $5.8 million of junior 
redeemable preferred stock and $1.6 million of junior perpetual preferred stock 
have elected not to exchange their shares for common stock. Tuesday Morning 
will redeem these shares in connection with the offerings for a redemption 
price equal to approximately $1,112 per share (the shares' liquidation value 
plus accrued but unpaid dividends). 

Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short-term, interest bearing, investment grade securities."

($16.0 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option, granted to the 
Underwriters by the Company is exercised in full), after deducting the 
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. 

The principal purposes of the Offering are to provide increased visibility of 
the Company in a marketplace where many of its competitors are publicly held 
companies, to create a public market for the Common Stock, to increase the 
Company's equity capital, to facilitate future access by the Company to the 
public equity markets, to repay indebtedness and to fund potential 
acquisitions. 

The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering to repay 
$5.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Company's bank credit 
facilities, which totaled approximately $15.5 million as of December 31, 1998, 
and for working capital and other corporate purposes. The indebtedness to be 
repaid upon the completion of the Offering is due on demand and the weighted 
average interest rate of such indebtedness was 13% per annum for the year ended 
December 31, 1998. The Company may also apply a portion of the net proceeds of 
the Offering to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that 
are complementary to those of the Company. Although the Company has not 
identified any specific businesses, products or technologies that it may 
acquire, nor are there any current agreements or negotiations with respect to 
any such transactions, the Company from time to time evaluates such 
opportunities. Pending such uses, the net proceeds will be invested in 
government securities and other short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
instruments. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

over-allotment option granted by us is exercised in full. We will not receive 
any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling

We intend to use approximately $17.0 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering to finance the development of new BUCA di BEPPO restaurants during the 
next twelve months and $7.0 million to retire existing bank debt. Our agreement 
with our commercial lender, U.S. Bank National Association, requires us to 
repay all amounts outstanding under the $7.0 million term loan with the lender, 
which bears interest at 9.63% and matures on December 31, 2000. This debt was 
incurred to repay other BUCA debt and for the development of restaurants. In 
addition, we are required to repay all amounts outstanding in excess of $3.0 
million under our revolving line of credit with the lender, which bears 
interest at lender's prevailing reference rate plus 0.75% to 1.25%, depending 
upon the then-applicable cash flow coverage ratio, and expires on December 31, 
2000. Currently, we have $2.0 million outstanding under our revolving line of 
credit. We anticipate that prior to the completion of the offering we will 
borrow additional amounts from our revolving line of credit to fund a portion 
of our new restaurant development. We plan to repay these outstanding amounts, 
which will be a part of the $17.0 million of development expenditures, with the 
net proceeds from this offering. 

The balance of the net proceeds from this offering will be used to finance the 
development of BUCA di BEPPO restaurants in subsequent periods and for general 
corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the 
acquisition of other restaurant operations. We do not currently have any 
definitive agreements, arrangements or understandings regarding any particular 
acquisition. Pending application of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. See

Sales and Marketing. We intend to produce, create and place television 
advertising, Internet and print commercials. We also expect to hire additional 
personnel to engage in these activities. 
Expand and Upgrade Network. We intend to expand our network infrastructure to 
support an increasing client base and to purchase additional computer and 
telephone communications equipment to create an off-site back-up communications 
center or hot site. 

Expand Client Services. We expect to hire additional personnel and purchase 
additional systems and equipment to: 

o convert to self-clearing; 

o engage in operations with international financial institutions and clients; 

o provide additional client support; 

o continue to develop software and programming; and 

o expand our third-market institutional sales desk to increase the number of 
securities we cover for this market. 

Repayment of Indebtedness. We intend to repay: 

o the $500,000 principal amount promissory note, plus a $5,000 prepayment fee, 
to New York Small Business Venture Fund LLC; and 

o $250,000 principal amount of promissory notes, bearing interest at an annual 
rate of 8%, including approximately $100,000 principal amount of promissory 
notes held by Mel Steinberg, the father of Eric Steinberg, our Executive Vice 
President. 

o approximately $32,000 of accrued interest due on the promissory notes 

The $500,000 principal amount promissory note bears interest at an annual rate 
of 12% and is due October 2003, subject to prepayment. We used the proceeds of 
these loans for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Working Capital and General Corporate Purposes. We may use a portion of the 
proceeds allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes to pay a 
portion of trade payables incurred from time to time and the salaries of our 
officers, if cash flow from operations is insufficient for these purposes. 

Over-allotment Option. If the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option 
in full, we will realize additional net proceeds of $1,842,000, all of which 
will be allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes. 

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of this offering based upon the current status of our business. We 
based this estimate on assumptions, including continued expansion of our client 
base and corresponding increases in revenues and that our proposed network 
expansion can be completed and new services can be introduced without 
unanticipated delays or costs. If any of these factors change, we may find it 
necessary to reallocate a portion of the proceeds within the above-described 
categories or use portions of the proceeds for other purposes. Our estimates 
may prove to be inaccurate, new programs or activities may be undertaken which 
will require considerable additional expenditures or unforeseen expenses may 
occur. 
Based upon our current plans and assumptions relating to our business plan, we 
anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering will satisfy our capital 
requirements for at least twelve months following the closing of this offering.
 If our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to 
seek additional financing sooner than currently anticipated or curtail our 
operations. We cannot assure you that the proceeds of this offering will be 
sufficient to fund our proposed expansion or that additional financing will 
become available if needed. 

We will invest proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described 
above principally in United States government securities, short term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest 
bearing investments."

 of the 4,000,000 shares of common stock it is offering, net of underwriting 
discounts and estimated expenses, and based on an initial public offering price
 of $13.00 per share. Proxicom will not realize any proceeds from the sale of 
common stock by the selling stockholders. 
The primary purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, create
 a public market for our common stock and facilitate future access to public 
markets. Proxicom intends to use the majority of the offering's net proceeds for
 working capital and general corporate purposes (including increases in personnel
 and marketing activities). Proxicom will use a portion of the proceeds to pay 
off a $1.4 million note payable to an investment bank for services in connection
 with the IBIS Consulting transaction. The note accrues interest at 7.0% per 
annum and matures upon the earlier of August 21, 1999 or the completion of an
 initial public offering. Proxicom may use a portion of the proceeds for strategic 
acquisitions. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, Proxicom
 evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies. In 
March 1999, Proxicom reached an agreement to invest approximately $360,000 in a 
joint venture company in Italy with Ericsson Telecommunicazioni SpA. Other than
 this transaction, Proxicom has no present understandings or agreements with
 respect to any acquisition of businesses, products or technologies. 
Pending use of the net proceeds for the above purposes, Proxicom intends to
 invest such funds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.
 In addition to the use of the net proceeds received by it from the offering,
 Proxicom also expects during the next 18 months to meet its working capital 
requirements through existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
 cash from sales of services, its credit facility and possibly other borrowings.

As described under ""Business--Objectives and Strategy"", the Company intends to

negotiations with third parties, obtaining required government approvals, and 
obtaining required shareholder or board approvals. See ""Risk Factors--Risks

offering cannot be determined until the offering is completed, it is presently 
anticipated that the net proceeds will be between $25.0 million and $34.2 
million, or $39.5 million if the offering range is increased by 15%. 
See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion--Share Exchange Ratio"" and ""--Stock 
Pricing and Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive 
at these amounts. First Federal Bankshares will be unable to use any of the net 
proceeds of the offering until the consummation of the conversion. 

First Federal Bankshares estimates that it will use between $20.0 million and 
$29.2 million, or $34.5 million if the offering range is increased by 15%, to 
purchase all of the capital stock of First Federal to be issued upon conversion.
First Federal Bankshares will retain net proceeds in the amount of $5.0 million,
a portion of which is expected to be used to fund the loan to the Employee Stock
Ownership Plan. The balance of funds retained by First Federal Bankshares will 
be used for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include investment 
in federal funds, short-term investment grade marketable securities and mortgage
-backed securities. 

The loan to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan will enable it to purchase 7% of 
the shares of First Federal Bankshares common stock issued in the offering. 
First Federal Bankshares and First Federal may also elect to fund the Employee 
Stock Ownership Plan's stock purchases through a loan by a third party financial
institution. See ""Management of First Federal--Benefits."" The net proceeds 
retained by First Federal Bankshares may also be used to support the future 
expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment of new 
branch offices, and the acquisition of other financial institutions or 
diversification into other banking related businesses. First Federal Bankshares 
and First Federal intend to actively explore additional acquisitions, although 
with the exception of the Mid-Iowa Financial acquisition neither First Federal 
Bankshares nor First Federal has any specific plans, arrangements or 
understandings regarding any additional expansions or acquisitions at this time,
nor have criteria been established to identify potential candidates for 
acquisition. 

A tabular presentation of First Federal Bankshares expected use of proceeds is 
set forth below:

Upon completion of the conversion, the Board of Directors of First Federal 
Bankshares will have the authority to repurchase stock, as permitted by 
statutory and regulatory authority. Office of Thrift Supervision regulations 
generally do not permit First Federal Bankshares to repurchase any shares of its
common stock without regulatory approval for three years except that beginning 
one year following completion of the conversion, First Federal Bankshares may 
repurchase its common stock so long as: 

(1) the repurchases within the following two years are part of an open-market 
program not involving greater than 5% of its outstanding capital stock during a 
twelve-month period; 

(2) the repurchases do not cause First Federal to become ""undercapitalized"" 
within the meaning of the Office of Thrift Supervision prompt corrective action 
regulation; and 


(3) First Federal Bankshares provides to the Regional Director of the Office of 
Thrift Supervision no later than ten days prior to the commencement of a 
repurchase program written notice containing a full description of the program 
to be undertaken and the program is not disapproved by the Regional Director. 
Under current Office of Thrift Supervision policies, repurchases may be allowed 
in the first year following the conversion and in amounts greater than 5% in 
the second and third years following the conversion provided there are valid and
compelling business reasons for the repurchases and the Office of Thrift 
Supervision does not object to the repurchases. 

Based upon facts and circumstances following the conversion and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. These facts and circumstances may include but 
are not be limited to: 

(1) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to improve First Federal 
Bankshares' return on equity; 

(2) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans; and 

(3) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests 
of First Federal Bankshares and its shareholders. 

In the event First Federal Bankshares determines to repurchase stock, 
repurchases may be made at market prices which may be in excess of the 
Subscription Price in the offering. To the extent that First Federal Bankshares 
repurchases stock at market prices in excess of the per share book value, 
repurchases may have a dilutive effect upon the interests of existing 
stockholders. 

The portion of the net proceeds not retained by First Federal Bankshares, 
estimated to be $29.2 million at the maximum of the valuation range, will be 
contributed to First Federal. Such proceeds received by First Federal will 
increase First Federal's capital to support the Mid-Iowa Financial acquisition. 
The total cash cost of the acquisition to First Federal, which includes cash 
compensation to Mid-Iowa Financial stockholders and the cost of cashing out 
outstanding options on Mid-Iowa Financial common stock, is expected to be $27.8 
million. In the event all Mid-Iowa Financial's outstanding options were 
exercised prior to the consummation of the acquisition, the aggregate cash to 
be paid would equal $29.0 million. The net proceeds infused into First Federal 
may be used to fund all or a portion of the merger consideration for the Mid-
Iowa Financial acquisition. Any funds not used to support the acquisition will 
be added to First Federal's general funds to be used for general corporate 
purposes, including investment in one-to four-family residential mortgage loans,
investment in federal funds, short-term investment grade marketable securities 
and mortgage-backed securities, and to fund the 1999 Recognition Plan. 
See ""Management of First Federal--Benefits."" First Federal may also use such 
funds for the expansion of its facilities, and to expand operations through 
acquisitions of other financial institutions, branch offices, or other financial
services companies. Except as described in ""Acquisition of Mid-Iowa Financial,"" 
First Federal and First Federal Bankshares have not determined the approximate 
amount of net proceeds to be used for each of the purposes mentioned above."

o at least $6.0 million for marketing activities during fiscal 1999; 
o approximately $4.0 million for capital expenditures, including investments 
in technology and physical infrastructure, and the acquisition of online 
content and distribution relationships; and 
o to repay an amount due to our parent ($573,000 at January 31, 1999). 

Additionally, we intend to use $10.0 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering to purchase shares of common stock of our parent from our parent. 
In addition, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase an additional
630,000 shares of Class A common stock, we intend to use 60% of the resulting 
net proceeds to purchase additional shares of our parent's common stock from 
our parent. We will purchase such shares from our parent at a price equal to 
the average closing price of our parent's common stock on the five preceding 
trading days. As our sole stockholder prior to this offering, our parent is 
causing us to purchase shares of its common stock as a means of financing 
expansion of our parent's business. 

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds for other general corporate 
purposes, including working capital. The amounts actually expended for such 
working capital purposes may vary significantly and will depend on a number of 
factors, including the amount of our future revenues and the other factors 
described under ""Risk Factors."" Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion in
the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. A portion of the net 
proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, 
technologies, product lines or products. We have no current plans, agreements or
commitments with respect to any such acquisition. Pending such uses, we will 
invest the net proceeds of this offering in interest-bearing, investment grade 
securities through a wholly-owned subsidiary."

Value America intends to use the net proceeds of this offering for working

 utilize a majority of the net proceeds in connection with its advertising and
 promotional campaign. During 1998, Value America spent approximately $33.2 million

 potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies that could complement or
 expand its business. A portion of Value America's net proceeds may be used for

FIRST BANCORP OF INDIANA INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/first-bancorp-of-indiana-inc-10184-4531,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/first-bancorp-of-indiana-inc-10184-4531,424B3,2/23/1999,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1023531,"The amount of common stock being offered in the conversion is based on Capital 
Resources Group's estimate that, as of December 4, 1998, the pro forma market 
value of First Bancorp and First Federal ranged from $16,150,000 to $21,850,000 
(""Estimated Valuation Range""). The net proceeds from the sale of the common 
stock in this offering will range from approximately $15.5 million to $21.1 
million, or up to $24.4 million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased 
by 15%. See ""Pro Forma Data"" for the assumptions used to arrive at these 
amounts. First Bancorp will purchase all of the capital stock of First Federal 
to be issued in the conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the 
offering. This will result in First Bancorp retaining approximately $7.7 
million to $10.6 million of net proceeds, or up to $12.2 million if the 
Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%, and First Federal receiving an 
equal amount. 

Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the common stock will 
increase First Federal's capital and will support the expansion of First 
Federal's existing business activities. First Federal will use the funds 
contributed to it for general corporate purposes, including, initially, lending
 and investment in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. First 
Federal intends to increase its residential and consumer loan portfolios. 
Depending on loan demand, First Federal may consider using a portion of the 
conversion proceeds for additional investment in mortgage-backed securities. 

In connection with the conversion and the establishment of First Federal's 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (""ESOP""), First Bancorp intends to loan the ESOP 
the amount necessary to purchase 8% of the shares of common stock sold in the 
conversion. First Bancorp's loan to fund the ESOP may range from $1,292,000 to 
$1,748,000 based on the sale of 129,200 shares to the ESOP at the minimum of 
the Estimated Valuation Range and 174,800 shares at the maximum of the 
Estimated Valuation Range, respectively, at $10.00 per share. If 15% above the 
maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range, or 2,512,750 shares, are sold in the 
conversion, First Bancorp's loan to the ESOP would be $2,010,200 based on the 
sale of 201,020 shares to the ESOP. The Bank anticipates that the ESOP loan 
will have a 12-year term with interest payable at the prime rate as published 
in The Wall Street Journal on the closing date of the conversion. The loan will 
be repaid principally from First Federal's contributions to the ESOP and from 
any dividends paid on shares of common stock held by the ESOP. 

Other than as described above, neither First Bancorp nor First Federal has 
specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this offering. Although 
First Federal's capital currently exceeds regulatory requirements, First 
Federal is pursuing the mutual-to-stock conversion at this time in order to 
structure itself in the form used by commercial banks and most other financial 
services companies. For a discussion of management's business reasons for 
undertaking the conversion, see ""The Conversion--Reasons for the Conversion."" 

The remaining net proceeds retained by First Bancorp initially will be invested 
primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. These funds 
will be available for additional contributions to First Federal in the form of 
debt or equity, to support future diversification or acquisition activities, as 
a source of dividends to the stockholders of First Bancorp and for future 
repurchases of common stock to the extent permitted under Indiana law and 
federal regulations. First Bancorp will consider exploring opportunities to use 
these funds to expand operations through acquiring or establishing additional 
branch offices or acquiring other financial institutions. Currently, there are 
no specific plans, arrangements, agreements or understandings, written or oral, 
regarding any expansion activities. 
Following the conversion, the Board of Directors will have the authority to 
adopt plans for repurchases of common stock, consistent with statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Because First Bancorp has not yet issued stock there 
currently is insufficient information upon which an intention to repurchase 
stock could be based. The facts and circumstances upon which the Board of 
Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future would include but are 
not limited to: 

(1) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
 the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and the ability to improve First Bancorp's return 
on equity; 

(2) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans; and 

(3) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests 
of First Bancorp and its stockholders. 

Any stock repurchases will require a determination by the Board of Directors 
that both First Bancorp and First Federal will be capitalized in excess of all 
applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that capital 
will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, First Federal's 
level of nonperforming and classified assets, First Bancorp's and First 
Federal's current and projected results of operations and asset/liability 
structure, the economic environment and tax and other regulatory 
considerations. For a discussion of the regulatory limitations applicable to 
stock repurchases, see ""The Conversion--Restrictions on Repurchase of Stock."""

the offering, which will depend on the independent valuation and marketing 
considerations, and the expenses incurred by FloridaFirst and First Federal in 
connection with the offering. We estimate that we will receive net proceeds 
from the sale of the common stock of between $16.2 million at the minimum of 
the offering range and $25.8 million at the maximum, as adjusted of the 
offering range. Assuming the sale of $20.4 million of common stock at the 
midpoint of the offering range and the purchase of 8% of the shares by the 
employee stock ownership plan, the following table shows the manner in which we 
will use the net proceeds: 


Loan to employee stock ownership plan                            $ 1,636,000

Investment in First Federal                                        9,610,000

These funds will be initially ^ invested in U.S. government and federal agency 
securities, marketable securities, or a combination of both. We may also use 
the net proceeds to repurchase our stock. See ""The Offering - Restrictions on 
Repurchases of Shares."" 

The funds received by First Federal from FloridaFirst in return for the 
purchase of all its stock to be issued will be used for general corporate 
purposes. These funds will increase First Federal's total capital to expand 
investment and lending, internal growth, and possible external growth through 
the expansion and refurbishment of its branch office system within its existing 
market areas, including the installation of automated teller machines, 
technological advancements and expansion of its commercial and consumer lending 
programs. However, there are no current agreements or arrangements regarding 
expansion or the allocation of the proceeds. Net proceeds may also be used by 
First Federal to make contributions to the employee stock ownership plan which 
in turn would be used to repay the loan from FloridaFirst. 

If the employee stock ownership plan does not purchase common stock in the 
offering, it may purchase shares of common stock in the market after the 
reorganization. If the purchase price of the common stock is higher than $10.00 
per share, the amount of proceeds required for the purchase by the employee 
stock ownership plan will increase and the resulting stockholders' equity will 
decrease. 

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the reorganization may be 
more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the 
number of shares to be issued in the reorganization are adjusted to reflect a 
change in the estimated pro forma market value of FloridaFirst and First 
Federal. Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing First 
Federal deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for 
investment by First Federal but will result in a reduction of First Federal's 
deposits and interest expense as funds are transferred from interest-bearing 
certificates or other deposit accounts."

Under the Securities Act, the rules and regulations under the Securities Act, 
and the interpretations of the Commission, we may be required to offer 
rescission to investors in our 1998 private placements and our 1999 private 
placement. If we are so required and all of those investors determine to 
exercise such rescission rights, we would be required to refund the entirety of 
the gross proceeds of these private offerings to those investors. Those 
proceeds would be paid in part with the net proceeds of this offering. See 
""Risk Factors--We may be required to rescind our 1998 private placements and

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of the sale of the shares offered in this offering based upon our 
contemplated operations, our business plan, and current economic and industry 
conditions and is subject to reapportionment of proceeds among the categories 
listed above or to new categories in response to, among other things, changes 
in our plans, regulations, industry conditions, and future revenues and 
expenditures. The amount and timing of expenditures will vary depending on a 
number of factors, including changes in our contemplated operations or business 
plan and changes in economic and industry conditions. 

Based on our operating plan, we believe that the net proceeds of this offering, 
together with anticipated revenues from continuing operations, will be 
sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements and finance our plans for 
expansion for at least the next 18 months. We base this belief upon a number of 
assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. Accordingly, there can be no 
assurance that these resources will satisfy our capital requirements for said 
period. We may require additional financing in order to expand our operations. 
Additional financing may take the form of the issuance of common or preferred 
stock or debt securities, and may involve bank or other lender financing. There 
can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain needed additional capital on 
a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all.

PFSB Bancorp has received conditional Office of Thrift Supervision approval to
 purchase all of the capital stock of Palmyra Saving to be issued in the conversion 
in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the stock offering. Receipt of 50% of
 the net proceeds of the sale of the common stock will increase Palmyra Saving's
 capital and will support the expansion of Palmyra Saving's existing business 
activities. Palmyra Saving will use the funds contributed to it for general 
corporate purposes, including, initially, lending and investment in short-term
 U.S. Government and agency obligations. Depending on local loan demand, Palmyra 
Saving may consider using a portion of the conversion proceeds to purchase loan
 participation interests of the type it has purchased in the past and/or for
investment in mortgage-backed securities. 
PFSB Bancorp intends to loan the employee stock ownership plan the amount 
necessary to purchase 8% of the shares sold in the conversion. Accordingly, the 
employee stock ownership plan purchases would range between 44,200 shares at the
 minimum of the offering range and 59,800 shares at the maximum of the offering 
range. At the midpoint of the offering range, the employee stock ownership plan
 would purchase 52,000 shares. If 859,625 shares are issued in the conversion,
 the employee stock ownership plan would purchase 68,770 shares. It is anticipated 
that the employee stock ownership plan loan will have a 10-year term with interest 
payable at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the closing 
date of the conversion. The loan will be repaid principally from Palmyra Saving's 
contributions to the employee stock ownership plan and from any dividends paid 
on shares of common stock held by the employee stock ownership plan. 
The remaining net proceeds retained by PFSB Bancorp initially will be invested 
primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. These proceeds
 will be available for additional contributions to Palmyra Saving in the form of 
debt or equity, to support future diversification or acquisition activities, as
 a source of dividends to the stockholders of PFSB Bancorp and for future repurchases
 of common stock to the extent permitted under Missouri law and federal regulations.
 PFSB Bancorp will consider exploring opportunities to use these funds to expand 
operations through acquiring or establishing additional branch offices or acquiring 
other financial institutions. Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements,
 agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding any expansion activities.
 Except as described above, neither PFSB Bancorp nor Palmyra Saving has specific 
plans for the investment of the proceeds of this offering. Although Palmyra 
Saving's capital currently exceeds regulatory requirements, it is converting to
 stock form primarily to structure itself in the form of organization used by 
commercial banks and most other financial services companies. For a discussion
 of management's business reasons for undertaking the conversion, see ""The 
Conversion--Reasons for the Conversion."" 
Following the conversion, the Board of Directors will have the authority to 
adopt plans for repurchases of common stock that meet statutory and regulatory 
requirements. Since PFSB Bancorp has not yet issued stock, there currently is 
insufficient information upon which an intention to repurchase stock could be
 based. The Board of Directors will consider many facts and circumstances in 
determining whether to repurchase stock in the future. These factors include 
market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in
 the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
 the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the remaining 
outstanding shares, and the ability to improve PFSB Bancorp's return on equity.
 The avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit
 plans is another factor that will be considered. The Board of Directors will 
also consider any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best
 interests of PFSB Bancorp and its stockholders. Before any stock repurchases,
 the Board of Directors must determine that both PFSB Bancorp and Palmyra Saving 
will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after 
any repurchases and that capital will be adequate, taking into account, among 
other things, Palmyra Saving's level of nonperforming and classified assets, 
PFSB Bancorp's and Palmyra Saving's current and projected results of operations
and asset/liability structure, the economic environment and tax and other 
regulatory considerations. For a discussion of the regulatory limitations 
applicable to stock repurchases, see ""The Conversion--Restrictions on Repurchase 
of Stock."""
CAPITOL FEDERAL FINANCIAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/capitol-federal-financial-11898-4504,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/capitol-federal-financial-11898-4504,424B3,2/18/1999,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1055374,"Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock 
cannot be determined until the reorganization and stock issuance is completed, 
it is presently anticipated that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares 
of common stock will be between $315.9 million and $428.0 million and up to 
$492.5 million assuming an increase in the estimated value of the common stock 
sold in this offering by 15%. See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""Our Corporate Change 
and Stock Offering - How We Determined Our Price and the Number of Shares to be 
Issued in the Stock Offering"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at these 
amounts. 

Capitol Federal Financial will retain $50.0 million of the net reorganization 
proceeds and will purchase all of the capital stock of Capitol Federal Savings 
to be issued in the reorganization in exchange for the remaining reorganization 
proceeds, net of reorganization-related expenses and the loan to be made to the 
employee stock ownership plan. Capitol Federal Financial intends to use a 
portion of the net proceeds to make a loan directly to the employee stock 
ownership plan to enable the employee stock ownership plan to purchase up to 
8.0% of the shares of common stock sold in the offering of between 32,136,106 
and 50,000,000 shares of Capitol Federal Financial common stock at $10.00 per 
share through the Subscription Offering, the Community Offering and the Public 
Offering (the ""Offerings""). Based upon the issuance of 32,136,106 shares of 
common stock and 43,478,261 shares of common stock at the minimum and maximum 
of the estimated offering range, respectively, the loan to the employee stock 
ownership plan would be $25.7 million and $34.8 million, respectively. See 
""Management - Benefits - Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" The remaining net 
proceeds retained by Capitol Federal Financial initially may be used to invest 
in U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various maturities, 
mortgage-related or other securities, deposits in either Capitol Federal 
Savings or other financial institutions, or a combination thereof. The net 
proceeds retained by Capitol Federal Financial may ultimately be used to: 

o support Capitol Federal Savings' lending activities; 
o repay borrowings in the ordinary course of business; or 
o support the future expansion of operations through the establishment of 
additional banking offices or other customer facilities or through acquisitions 
of other financial institutions or branch offices, although no such acquisition 
transactions are specifically being considered at this time. 

The net proceeds from the Offerings may also be used for other business and 
investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special cash 
dividends, possible repurchases of the common stock or returns of capital. 
Capitol Federal Financial and Capitol Federal Savings have committed, however, 
not to take any action to further the payment of any return of capital on the 
common stock during the one-year period subsequent to completion of the 
reorganization. Management of Capitol Federal Financial may consider expanding 
or diversifying its activities, as such opportunities become available. 

Following the six-month anniversary of the completion of the reorganization, to 
the extent permitted by the Office of Thrift Supervision and based upon then 
existing facts and circumstances, Capitol Federal Financial's board of 
directors may determine to repurchase shares of common stock, subject to any 
applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Such facts and circumstances 
may include but not be limited to: 

o market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the 
investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of
 the remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in Capitol Federal 
Financial's return on equity; 

o the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans; and 

o any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests 
of Capitol Federal Financial and its stockholders. 

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of Capitol Federal 
Financial's board of directors that Capitol Federal Savings will be capitalized 
in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. 

The portion of the net proceeds used by Capitol Federal Financial to purchase 
the capital stock of Capitol Federal Savings will be added to Capitol Federal 
Savings' general funds to be used for general corporate purposes, including 
increased lending activities and to support the expansion of Capitol Federal 
Savings' wholesale leverage strategy, which entails the purchase of adjustable 
rate mortgage-related securities funded by fixed rate borrowings. See ""Risk
 Factors -Our use of proceeds from this offering to buy mortgage-related 
securities could increase our risk that changes in market interest rates will 
result in lower income."" While the amount of net proceeds received by Capitol 
Federal Savings will further strengthen Capitol Federal Savings' capital 
position, which already substantially exceeds all regulatory requirements, we 
are not reorganizing primarily to raise capital. After the reorganization and 
stock issuance, based upon the maximum of the estimated offering range, Capitol 
Federal Savings' tangible capital ratio will be approximately 16.67%. As a 
result, Capitol Federal Savings will continue to be a well-capitalized 
institution. 
The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the reorganization and 
stock issuance may be more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will 
also vary if the number of shares to be issued in the reorganization and stock 
issuance is adjusted to reflect a change in the estimated pro forma market 
value of Capitol Federal Savings. Payments for shares made through withdrawals 
from existing deposit accounts at Capitol Federal Savings will not result in 
the receipt of new funds for investment by Capitol Federal Savings but will 
result in a reduction of Capitol Federal Savings' interest expense and 
liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or 
other deposit accounts."
INET TECHNOLOGIES INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/inet-technologies-inc-3266-4850,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/inet-technologies-inc-3266-4850,424B4,5/27/1999,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1354044,"The Company will receive approximately $54.8 million from the sale of shares of 
Common Stock to be sold by the Company pursuant to the offerings (approximately 
$67.6 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment options are exercised in 
full) after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses 
payable by the Company. 

The principal purposes of the offerings are to increase the Company's equity 
capital, to create a public market for the Common Stock, to facilitate future 
access by the Company to public equity markets, to provide liquidity for 
certain of the Company's existing stockholders and to provide increased 
visibility of the Company in a marketplace where many of its competitors are 
publicly held companies. 

The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds of the offerings for 
working capital and general corporate purposes, including financing accounts 
receivable and capital expenditures made in the ordinary course of its 
business. The Company may also apply a portion of the proceeds of the offerings 
to acquire businesses, products and technologies, or enter into joint venture 
arrangements, that are complementary to the Company's business and product 
offerings. Although the Company has not identified any specific businesses, 
products, technologies or joint ventures that it may acquire or enter into, nor
 are there any current agreements or negotiations with respect to any such 
transactions, the Company from time to time evaluates such opportunities. 
Pending such uses, the net proceeds will be invested in government securities 
and other short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments. The 
Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the 
Selling Stockholders."

The principal purposes of this initial public offering are to create a public 
market for our common stock, facilitate future access to capital markets and
 enhance our ability to use our common stock as consideration for potential 
acquisitions and as a means of attracting and retaining key employees. After the
 retirement of a bank term loan of approximately $1.1 million at March 31, 1999,
 we intend to use the approximately $26.0 million remaining net proceeds of this
 offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital
 and capital expenditures. The term loan is payable in equal monthly installments 
of principal plus interest at the bank's prime rate plus 1% through December 31,
 2001, and the current interest rate is 8.75%. We may also use a portion of the
 net proceeds to acquire additional businesses, products and technologies or to
 establish joint ventures that we believe will complement our current or future
 business. However, we have no specific plans, agreements or commitments, oral
 or written, to do so and are not currently engaged in any negotiations for any
 such acquisition or joint venture. The amounts that we actually expend for working 
capital purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including 
future revenue growth, if any, the amount of cash we generate from operations 
and the progress of our product development efforts. As a result, our management 
will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering.
 Pending use of net proceeds for the above purposes, we intend to invest in

approximately $28.3 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment

net proceeds to pay the aggregate cash portion of the purchase prices for our 
initial acquisitions which then will be due and apply the balance to repay a 
portion of the indebtedness we will assume as a result of those acquisitions. 
That indebtedness totaled approximately $14.7 million at March 31, 1999 on a 
historical combined basis. See ""Certain Transactions -- Organizational 
Transactions."" 

We will refinance the assumed indebtedness we do not repay with proceeds of 
this offering with our initial borrowings under a new credit facility we will 
have in place when this offering closes. This facility will allow us to borrow 
up to $75 million for use in connection with acquisitions, working capital and 
other general corporate purposes. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital 
Resources -- Combined."" 

The owners of the businesses we acquire when this offering closes have 
guaranteed some of the indebtedness we will assume and repay or refinance. Some 
of those businesses owe some of that indebtedness to their owners. The assumed 
indebtedness bears interest at rates ranging from 4.73% to 10.6%. That 
indebtedness would otherwise mature at various dates through January 2005. 

If the working capitals of four of our initial acquired businesses on the date 
this offering closes meet specified levels, we may have to increase the cash 
portion of the purchase prices for those businesses by up to a total of 
approximately $9.0 million. We expect to pay any increase approximately 90 days 
after this offering closes with cash on hand or a borrowing under our credit 
facility. See ""Certain Transactions -- Organizational Transactions."""

(1) The Fleet Bank line of credit matures on April 1, 2001, accrues interest at a variable rate equal 
to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 
0.30% and was incurred in March 1998 to refinance advances from Henry Zachs, 
our Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric Zachs, our Co-Chairman, 
and certain of their affiliates, to refinance indebtedness guaranteed by Henry 
and Eric Zachs, as well as to provide us with general working capital. The 
interest rate applicable to the Fleet Bank line of credit was 5.26% as of March
 31, 1999. 

We are presently seeking one or more debt financings aggregating approximately 
$15.0 million to be used for capital expenditures, working capital and other 
general corporate purposes as a replacement for the Fleet Bank line of credit. 
We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any such financing or that, 
if available, it will be on terms we deem acceptable. 

We will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds from this 
offering. The amounts actually expended for any such purposes may vary 
significantly and will depend upon a number of factors, including the amount of 
our future revenues, our ability to obtain additional financing and other 
factors described under ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this prospectus. 
Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, investment grade securities."

stores and other capital expenditures; working capital; and other general 
corporate purposes. In addition, bn.com may use a portion of such net proceeds 
to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or 
products, although there are no current agreements with respect to any such

the cost of advertising and strategic alliances, and the need for quick 
responses to competition), the Company cannot specify with certainty the

management's view, the needs of the business so require. In addition, a large 
portion of the proceeds is allocated to discretionary purposes. Investors may 
not agree with any such allocation or reallocation. 

Based on our operating plan, we believe that the net proceeds of this offering, 
together with available funds on hand and cash flow from future operations, 
will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least 12 
months following this offering. Such belief is based upon certain assumptions 
(including assumptions as to our contemplated operations and business plan and 
economic and industry conditions). We cannot be certain that such resources 
will be sufficient for such purpose. Furthermore, if we were to make 
significant acquisitions for cash consideration, we would require additional 
capital. In addition, contingencies may arise that may require us to obtain 
additional capital. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such 
capital on favorable terms or at all. Pending use of the net proceeds of this 
offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest- 
bearing, investment grade securities. Please see ""Capitalization,""

the Company pursuant to the Offering are estimated to be approximately $106.4 
million ($122.4 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised 
in full) after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
Offering expenses payable by the Company, net of certain reimbursements. See 
""Underwriting."" The principal purposes of the Offering are to create a public 
market for the Class A Common Stock, enhance Nextera's ability to use its Class 
A Common Stock as a means of attracting, motivating and retaining key 
employees, facilitate the Company's future access to public equity markets, 
repay indebtedness, and obtain additional working capital. Nextera intends to 
use the net proceeds from the Offering as follows: 

(i) approximately $79.3 million to repay outstanding principal and interest 
under a $77.5 million credit facility entered into effective August 31, 1998, 
and amended effective December 31, 1998 and April 15, 1999 (the ""Bridge Loan"") 
which bears interest at 12% per annum, and matures on May 31, 1999. Under the 
Bridge Loan, the Company borrowed $38.0 million to finance the Sibson 
Acquisitions, $31.1 million to finance the Lexecon Acquisition, $4.2 million to 
finance the payment of bonuses to certain non-stockholder key executives of 
Lexecon, $2.0 million to finance the acquisition of Alexander and $2.2 million 
for general corporate purposes, including working capital. See ""Certain 
Transactions--Bridge Loan Amendment."" Knowledge Universe holds a note from the 
Company with a principal amount of $37.5 million and Nextera Funding, Inc., an 
entity not affiliated with the Company, holds the remaining interests under the 
Bridge Loan. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""Underwriting."" 

(ii) approximately $750,000 will be paid to Nextera Funding, Inc., an entity 
not affiliated with the Company, in consideration for certain consents and 
amendments given in connection with the amendment to the Bridge Loan. See 
""Underwriting."" 

(iii) approximately $410,000 to pay accrued management fees to Knowledge 
Universe. See ""Certain Transactions--Management Agreement."" 

(iv) approximately $26.4 million to repay outstanding interest on and a portion 
of the principal of the March Debenture. Approximately $880,000 of principal of 
the March Debenture and $27.9 million of principal and interest on the January 
Debenture will remain outstanding after the Offering. Each of the Debentures 
bears interest at 10% per annum, and matures on May 1, 2002. All of the 
interests in the Debentures are held by Knowledge Universe, Messrs. Brebach, 
Bohlin and Muldowney, Ms. Bergevine and one other employee of the Company, who 
will receive payments of approximately $25.9 million, $308,000, $27,000, 
$39,000, $39,000, and $39,000, respectively upon the partial repayment of the 
March Debenture. The indebtedness associated with the Debentures was incurred 
to finance acquisitions and for general working capital purposes. See ""The 
Company--Recapitalization,"" ""Certain Transactions--Investments in the Company"" 
and ""--Amendment of the Debentures."" Upon the partial repayment of the March 
Debenture, Messrs. Brebach and Muldowney, Ms. Bergevine and one other employee 
of the Company will repay $308,000, $39,000, $34,000 and $39,000, respectively, 
pursuant to promissory notes executed by them and held by the Company. See 
""Certain Transactions--Loans to Certain Officers.""

in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. Although Nextera 
examines potential acquisition opportunities from time to time, other than as 
disclosed in this Prospectus, the Company has no current plans, commitments, 
agreements or understandings with respect to any material acquisitions or

The revolving loan from Westburg Media Capital, L.P. to be repaid was used by 
Multi-Link for working capital and to repay other indebtedness, is evidenced by 
two promissory notes that bear interest at a rate of prime rate plus three 
percent and, after it is repaid, will continue to be available to be drawn on 
by Multi-Link. The use of proceeds from this offering to repay debt will 
benefit two officers and directors of Multi-Link. These two officers and 
directors will benefit because the outstanding amount of the loan as to which 
they have provided personal guarantees will be reduced. See ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and 
""Management -- Certain Transactions"" for more detailed descriptions of this 
loan and the personal guarantees. 

Voice messaging businesses that Multi-Link will consider acquiring will likely: 

- be established in a larger, urban North American market; 

- service a critical mass of business subscribers; 

- use older and easily replaceable or upgradeable voice messaging equipment; 

- be owned by an individual interested in continuing some management 
responsibilities and receiving stock as partial consideration for the purchase; 
and 

- have facilities that can support expansion. 

Multi-Link has no present commitments, agreements or understandings with 
respect to any such acquisitions. 

Working capital will be used to pay such items as the payment of rent, office 
expenses, equipment, equipment repairs, salaries and Multi-Link's other day-to-
day costs of doing business. If the over-allotment option is exercised by the 
underwriters or if warrants are exercised, Multi-Link will allocate the 
additional proceeds to acquisitions and working capital provided, however, 
amounts allocated to working capital will not exceed 15% of the net proceeds. 

The foregoing represents Multi-Link's best estimate of the uses of the net 
proceeds to be received in this offering, based on current planning and 
business conditions. However, Multi-Link reserves the right to change such uses 
when and if market conditions or unexpected changes in operating conditions or 
results of operations occur. The amounts actually expended for each use may 
vary significantly depending upon a number of factors including, but not 
limited to, future acquisitions and the amount of cash generated by Multi-
Link's operations. Multi-Link believes that its existing capital resources and 
the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to maintain its current 
and planned operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this 
prospectus. Net proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described 
above will be invested principally in investment grade, interest-bearing 
securities."

development of strategic alliances and relationships including: 

- local newspaper, radio and broadcast and cable television advertising, 

- bulletin board advertising and 

- hiring a public relations firm. 

- General corporate purposes include the following: 

- hiring additional personnel; 

- acquiring and enhancing our operating, support and management systems; 

- costs of opening two new sales offices; and 

- capital expenditures for computers and other equipment. 

Approximately $100,000 of the marketing and promotional expenses will be used 
for the further development and expansion of our web site. The majority of this 
amount will be used for programmers. 

Working capital may also be applied to acquisitions, although we do not have 
current plans, agreements or commitments for any acquisition. Any proceeds from 
the exercise of the option we granted to the underwriters to purchase 
additional common shares from us will be added to working capital. In addition, 
the proceeds from the repayment of Assaf Ran's loan, approximately $300,000, 
will be added to working capital. See ""Related Party Transactions"" for more 
information about this loan. 
We will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this

requirements for at least 12 months following the consummation of this

We have complete discretion over how to use a significant portion of the net 
proceeds of this offering. We cannot assure investors that our use of the net 
proceeds will not vary substantially due to unforeseen factors. If we do not 
complete an acquisition, the proceeds of this offering that otherwise would 
have been used to complete that acquisition will be applied to working capital 
or other possible acquisitions. 

The assets that we acquired from the stockholders of Global 2000 
Communications, Inc. and the assets that we will acquire from the four 
additional Internet service providers to be acquired at the closing of this 
offering, for a total purchase price of $14,130,000, include approximately:

telecommunications equipment, and furniture and fixtures; and 

- the remaining amount will be allocated to goodwill and other intangible 
assets. 

These Internet service providers were not affiliates of BiznessOnline at or

closing of this offering, we have no current agreements or commitments to 
acquire any new companies and we are not currently negotiating with any 
acquisition candidates. Prior to applying the net proceeds of this offering as 
illustrated in the preceding table, the proceeds will be invested in short-
term, interest bearing, investment grade and government securities. We believe 
that our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from this offering will be 
sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months."

equaled $178.3 million. All remaining proceeds will be used for general 
corporate and working capital purposes, which may include acquisitions and 
joint ventures. Pending these uses, the net proceeds of the Offering will be 
invested in short-term, money market instruments. This subordinated 
indebtedness that will be repaid bears interest payable in kind at an annual 
rate equal to The Chase Manhattan Bank's prime lending rate as in effect from 
time to time, and matures on August 15, 2008. 

The Company, from time to time, evaluates potential acquisitions of, and joint 
ventures relating to, networks currently owned and operated by other companies,
 including affiliates of the Existing Stockholders, and expects to continue to 
do so. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any 
acquisition or joint venture, it may require additional financing or it may 
elect to use a portion of the proceeds of the Offering or the proceeds from the 
sale of the Notes not previously expended for other purposes. 

The Company expects that any net proceeds of the Offering that remain after 
repayment of subordinated indebtedness to affiliates of the Existing 
Stockholders, together with the net proceeds received from the sale of the 
Notes and internally generated funds, will provide sufficient funds for the 
Company to: 

expand its business as currently planned, 

pay interest on the Notes and 

fund its currently expected losses, 

in each case through the middle of 2000. After that, the Company expects to 
require additional financing. However, if the Company's plans or assumptions 
change or prove to be inaccurate, or the foregoing sources of funds prove to be 
insufficient to fund the Company's growth and operations, or if the Company 
consummates acquisitions or joint ventures, the Company may be required to seek 
additional capital sooner than currently anticipated. 

The Company's revenues and costs are dependent upon factors that the Company 
cannot control, such as regulatory changes, changes in technology and increased 
competition. Due to the uncertainty of these and other factors, actual revenues 
and costs may vary from expected amounts, possibly to a material degree, and 
such variations are likely to affect the Company's future capital requirements. 
Sources of financing may include public or private debt or equity financing by 
the Company or its subsidiaries, vendor financing or other financing 
arrangements. At a future date, the Company may negotiate a bank credit 
facility to provide it with working capital and enhance its financial 
flexibility. This financing may not be available on terms acceptable to the 
Company or at all. The Company's issuance of additional equity securities could 
cause substantial dilution of your interest in the Company."

approximately $163.0 million from the sale of shares of common stock in the 
offering after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated expenses (approximately $187.6 million if the underwriters' over-
allotment option is exercised in full). We intend to use net proceeds of 
approximately $60.0 million from the offering to retire all of the outstanding 
11 1/8% senior discount notes due 2008 (of which approximately $54.0 million 
will be applied to the principal amount of such notes and approximately $6.0 
million will be applied to a prepayment premium), and the balance to repay all 
or a portion of the existing revolving credit facility and term loans under the 
credit facilities. Pending application of the net proceeds from the offering to 
repay the senior discount notes, we plan to borrow approximately $60.0 million 
in funds under the delayed draw term loan facility to further reduce 
outstanding indebtedness under the credit facilities. 

The senior discount notes were sold at a discount resulting in a yield to 
maturity of 11.175% per annum and will mature on June 1, 2008. As of December 
31, 1998, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
was 8.3% per annum, the interest rate on the Tranche A term loan was 7.6% per 
annum, and the interest rate on the Tranche B term loan was 7.8% per annum. The 
revolving credit facility matures on June 5, 2004. The Tranche A term loan 
matures on June 5, 2004, and the Tranche B term loan matures on June 5, 2006. 
WESCO used the proceeds of the revolving credit facility for general corporate 
purposes. WESCO used the proceeds of the term loans and the proceeds of the 
issuance of senior discount notes to pay certain fees and expenses and to repay 
certain indebtedness in connection with the recapitalization. See Note 9 to 
Consolidated Financial Statements."

8% beginning December 1, 1999, net of repayments. Approximately $3.0 million of 
our debt bears interest at an annual rate of 13% during the term of the loan. 
We have not yet made any material commitments to these purposes other than the
 repayment of debt. Accordingly, management will have significant flexibility 
in applying the net proceeds of this offering to these uses, as well as to other 
general corporate purposes. Our allocation of net proceeds will depend upon 
developments and opportunities in our business, the various geographic markets 
and the Internet industry in general. Pending any such use, as described above,
 we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing instruments. We will
 not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

estimated offering expenses payable by MapQuest. The principal purposes of this
offering are to obtain additional capital, to create a public market for the
common stock and to facilitate future access by MapQuest to public securities
markets.
    MapQuest intends to use approximately $8.6 million of the net proceeds to
redeem the 1,398,835 outstanding shares of MapQuest's series B preferred stock.
MapQuest intends to use the remaining net proceeds to execute its business
plan. As part of this plan, MapQuest expects to increase its sales and
marketing efforts by hiring additional internal sales personnel and by
increasing its promotional and advertising spending. MapQuest estimates that
its capital expenditures will be approximately $4.0 million in 1999, which is
expected to be used for technical infrastructure improvements and for the
expansion of MapQuest's office space. A portion of the net proceeds also may be
used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products or services.
MapQuest has not yet determined the amount of net proceeds to be used
specifically for each of the preceding purposes. Accordingly, management will
have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering.
Pending use of the net proceeds for the above purposes, MapQuest intends to
invest such funds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

The allocation of the net proceeds from this offering set forth above 
represents our best estimate based upon our currently proposed plans and 
assumptions relating to our operations and certain assumptions regarding 
general economic conditions. If any of these factors change, we may find it 
necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-
described categories or to use portions for other purposes. 

We anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering, together with projected 
revenues from our operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and 
capital requirements for at least 12 months following this offering. We cannot 
assure you, however, that such funds will not be expended earlier due to 
unanticipated changes in economic conditions or other circumstances that we 
cannot foresee. In the event our plans change or our assumptions change or 
prove to be inaccurate, we could be required to seek additional financing 
sooner than currently anticipated. We also expect that, when the opportunity 
arises, we may acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products or 
technologies. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements with 
respect to any material acquisition or investment. 
Pending the use of proceeds in the manner mentioned above, the net proceeds of 
this offering will be invested principally in short-term, interest-bearing 
investment-grade securities."

the remaining working capital will be income producing investments as permitted 
by banking regulations, including additional investment in the Bank as 
determined to be prudent by the Company's Board.

million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full.

million. Seminis intends to use the net proceeds of the offering and funds 
available under the new credit facility to repay indebtedness of Seminis and 
pay $3.5 million of fees and expenses relating to its new credit facility. 

- Seminis will repay the following indebtedness: 

-- borrowings of $473.0 million under its current credit agreement comprised of 
a $28.0 million secured revolving credit note, bearing interest at the rate of 
9.8% per annum as of May 7, 1999 and due June 30, 2000, and a $445.0 million 
secured term loan, bearing interest at a rate of 9.8% per annum as of May 7, 
1999 and due June 30, 2000, and 

-- $7.7 million of an intercompany advance of $20.0 million from Savia accruing 
interest at the rate of 10.0% per annum, the balance of which will be converted 
into shares of our Class C preferred stock. 

Seminis entered into its current credit agreement on April 30, 1999. The 
proceeds of the current credit agreement were used to repay Seminis' old credit 
agreement, to repay a $10.0 million bank demand note and to finance working 
capital. The proceeds of the old credit agreement were used to repurchase Class 
B mandatorily redeemable common stock of Seminis' predecessor, Seminis, Inc., 
an Illinois corporation, acquire the South Korean seed companies Hungnong and 
Choong Ang, acquire assets and distribution rights of LSL PlantScience and 
acquire assets comprising the Agroceres brand vegetable seed business in 
Brazil. The proceeds from the Savia intercompany advance and the bank demand 
note were used to finance working capital requirements.

obligations, short-term debt securities and other money market instruments."

existing cash balances, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital 
expenditure requirements and minimum purchase commitments through the end of 
the year 2000. For more information about our uses of proceeds of this

 net proceeds to repay loans outstanding to NationsBank, N.A. The term loan 
portion of the NationsBank loans (of which approximately $575,000 is outstanding), 
which was used to repay our obligations to Silicon Valley Bank, bears interest
 at the prime rate plus 1% and matures on August 15, 2001. The line of credit
 portion of the loans (of which approximately $312,500 is outstanding) bears 
interest at Libor plus 1.75% and is due upon completion of this offering. We used
 the proceeds derived from both the NationsBank line of credit and from the 
original Silicon Valley loan for general working capital. We may borrow additional 
amounts under the line of credit prior to the consummation of the offering to 
fund our current working capital needs. The proceeds of the offering will be used 
to repay any additional debt we incur prior to completion of the offering to 
fund our current working capital needs. As of the date of this prospectus, we 
cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the remaining net

strategy. The bank's current regulatory capital level does not allow the bank 
to continue its growth strategy and remain a well-capitalized institution under 
applicable regulations. Increasing its regulatory capital by $12.9 million will 
allow the bank to increase its asset size by in excess of $258 million which 
the bank plans to do over the next two years. This increase in regulatory 
capital will permit the bank to expand its branch network, increase its 
origination of loans and purchases of investment and mortgage-backed securities 
which are expected to be funded primarily through increases in deposits, FHLB 
advances and reverse repurchase agreements. We intend to use the proceeds 
retained at the company level for purchasing investment securities and, when 
appropriate, originating construction and commercial loans to the extent those 
loans exceed the amount the bank can make under applicable regulations. Pending 
their longer-term use, the net proceeds from this offering are expected to be

bank. We also intend to retire approximately $4.9 million of aggregate 
outstanding indebtedness to Communication Partners, L.P., a related party. This 
loan bears interest at a rate of 8.0% and expires May 1, 2003. We also intend 
to loan Mr. Geday, our President and Chief Executive Officer, approximately 
$1.4 million for the payment of withholding taxes in connection with his early 
exercise of options to purchase our common stock. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

After the payment of our outstanding indebtedness and the loan to Mr. Geday, 
the net proceeds we will receive from the offering will be approximately $36.5 
million, or $43.3 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full. We intend to use these remaining proceeds primarily for 
additional working capital. Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds 
to acquire technology or businesses that are complementary to our business, we 
have no current plans in this regard. Pending such uses, we plan to invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities. 
Another primary purpose of the offering is to create a public market for our 
common stock and facilitate our future access to public capital markets."

The principal reasons for this offering are to raise funds to use for the 
following purposes and in the following priorities: 

. to fund the development of our products and services; 

. to expand our sales and marketing efforts; 

. to make complementary acquisitions or investments; 

. for working capital and other general corporate purposes; and 

. to fund operating losses. 

As noted above, we may acquire or invest in complementary businesses,

used for such acquisitions or investments. However, other than with respect to 
our recently completed acquisitions of Online Medical Bookstore and InterLink, 
we currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements for any material 
acquisition or investment. No proceeds from the offering will be used to

     discount brokerage and brokerage clearance businesses
     of TD Bank as part of the reorganization (interest rate
     of Canadian banker's acceptance rate plus .50% per

We have not allocated for specific purposes a substantial portion of the 
estimated proceeds from the offerings. After repayment of the intercompany debt 
and redemption of the preferred stock as described above, approximately $636 
million of net proceeds will be available to us. While we have not yet 
allocated this portion of the net proceeds for specific purposes, we anticipate 
that we will use these proceeds for investments in technology and systems 
upgrades, increases in our advertising and marketing budget and other working 
capital and general corporate purposes. The exact amount and timing of such
 expenditures, however, will depend upon a number of factors, including growth 
in customers and trading activity, market conditions and technological 
developments, and accordingly, management will have broad discretion in 
allocating the proceeds from the offerings for specific purposes. We may also 
use a portion of the net proceeds to help finance acquisitions of other 
companies, although we do not currently have any pending or proposed 
significant acquisitions. 

Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in short-term liquid 
instruments, including deposit obligations, commercial paper and other debt 
securities of TD Bank. 

We have decided to become a public company at this time in order to raise 
capital for our ongoing growth, realize some of the current value of our 
businesses and enable us to use publicly traded securities reflecting our 
businesses and prospects to finance strategic acquisitions that we may decide 
to pursue in the future. The size of the offerings was determined by management 
based upon their judgment as to the appropriate balance of a number of factors, 
including our current and projected capital needs and those of TD Bank, current 
and anticipated market conditions, the minimum amount of publicly-held shares 
necessary to facilitate an active trading market for the shares on both the 
NYSE and the TSE, and other relevant considerations."

limited to, a subsidiary for the Company's franchising operation, subsidiary 
for the retail sale of electrical power and a subsidiary for a joint venture

(3) The net proceeds allocated to marketing and sales are expected to be

The foregoing represents the Company's estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of the Offering, based upon the current status of its operations and 
anticipated business needs. It is possible, however, that the application of

changes in the economic climate and/or the Company's planned business 
operations or unanticipated complications, delays and expenses, as well as any 
potential acquisitions that the Company may consummate, although no specific 
acquisition has been identified. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of

proceeds will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company. 
Any additional net proceeds realized from the exercise of the Over-Allotment 
Option (up to approximately $456,750) will be added to the Company's working 
capital. 

Pending application, the net proceeds will be invested principally in short-

FIRST COMMUNITY FINANCIAL CORP /NC/,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/first-community-financial-corp-nc-9655-4638,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/first-community-financial-corp-nc-9655-4638,424B3,5/14/1999,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1570074,"Community Savings is not converting at this time because it needs additional 
capital to achieve any specific business objective. Community Savings now has 
no stockholders. While the institution has a significant net worth, its 
existing members are not able to receive any return on such net worth like 
stockholders of a stock institution. Community Savings is converting to stock 
form and forming First Community as its holding company so that it will have 
increased flexibility to react to changes in its operating environment, so that 
it will have greater capital and enhanced access to capital markets in the 
future and so that its depositors and other members and its management and 
employees will be able to share in the net worth and earnings of Community 
Savings as stockholders. See ""The Conversion - General"" and ""The Conversion - 
Purposes of Conversion."" 

Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of the common stock cannot be 
determined until the conversion is completed, First Community estimates that 
the net proceeds will be between $22,076,000 and $30,045,000, based on the 
current valuation range. If the gross proceeds of the shares sold are increased 
to 15% above the maximum of the valuation range, First Community estimates that 
net proceeds will equal $34,627,500. See ""Pro Forma Data"" for the assumptions 
used to arrive at these amounts. The actual net proceeds may vary materially 
from the estimated amounts. 
The estimated amount of net proceeds includes proceeds from the sale of the 
shares which First Community expects to be purchased by the ESOP in the 
subscription offering with funds borrowed from First Community. First Community 
expects the amount loaned to the ESOP to range from $1,956,000, assuming 
1,530,000 shares are issued in the conversion, to $2,604,000, assuming
 2,070,000 shares are issued in the conversion. If for any reason the ESOP is 
unable to purchase its shares in the subscription offering, First Community 
expects the ESOP to purchase its shares in the open market - in which event the 
cost of the purchases may be higher or lower because the purchase price per 
share may be higher or lower than $15.00. See ""Management of Community Savings 
- Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" 

After first deducting the amount of the net proceeds loaned by First Community 
to the ESOP, which are estimated to range from $1,956,000 to $2,604,000, First 
Community expects to retain approximately 50% of the remaining net proceeds of
 the offering and will pay the balance of the net proceeds to Community Savings 
in exchange for all of the common stock of Community Savings to be issued in 
connection with the conversion. From such balance paid to Community Savings, 
First Community expects that Community Savings will pay $1,500,000 back to 
First Community for the 100,000 shares of common stock to be issued to 
Community Savings and then contributed to Community Savings Charitable 
Foundation. 

First Community expects to use the portion of the net proceeds it retains for 
working capital and investment purposes. First Community does not expect to 
have significant operating expenses and anticipates that it will initially 
invest the net proceeds it retains primarily in interest-earning deposits, U.S.
 government, federal agency and other marketable securities and mortgage-backed 
securities. The types and amounts of First Community's investments will vary 
from time to time based upon the interest rate environment, asset/liability mix 
considerations and other factors. In the event management determines that the 
return on these proceeds would be increased if they are invested by Community 
Savings in loans or other assets, First Community expects to loan the proceeds 
to, or invest them in, or to deposit them in either interest-bearing or 
noninterest-bearing accounts at, Community Savings. Community Savings would 
then invest those amounts in loans or investments in accordance with its then 
existing lending and investment policies. 

Net proceeds paid to Community Savings initially will become part of Community 
Savings' general funds and will be invested primarily in loans, mortgage-backed 
securities and investments consisting primarily of interest- earning deposit 
balances, U.S. government and federal agency obligations and other marketable 
securities in accordance with Community Savings' lending and investment 
policies. The relative amounts Community Savings will invest in each of these 
types of investments will depend upon loan demand, rates of return and asset/
liability matching considerations at the time the investments are to be made. 
In using the proceeds paid to it, Community Savings expects to continue its 
recent efforts to invest more of its assets in commercial, construction and 
consumer loans and less of its assets in investment and mortgage backed 
securities. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations -- Management Strategy."" Management is not able to 
predict the yields which will be produced by the investment of the proceeds of 
the offerings because such yields will be significantly influenced by general 
economic conditions and the interest rate environment existing at the time the 
investments are made. Community Savings will use proceeds not so invested for 
general corporate purposes. The following chart illustrates how management 
currently expects to initially use the proceeds of the offering. The chart 
assumes that 1,800,000 shares will be sold. The amounts shown in the chart are 
estimates only. The estimated amounts set forth in the chart would be different 
if the number of shares sold is different from 1,800,000, if the actual 
expenses of the offering are different from estimated amounts or if there is an 
oversubscription and the ESOP is unable to buy its shares in the subscription 
offering."

stock being offered by this prospectus are estimated to be approximately $64.3

option in full, based upon the initial public offering price of $12.00 per 
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by AppNet. 

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering to: 
- repay approximately $61.7 million of aggregate indebtedness, including accrued
interest under our existing credit facilities, a $26 million revolving credit 
facility and a $40 million revolving credit facility, both of which are with 
BankBoston, N.A. and Antares Capital Corporation; 

- repay $3,300 on a note to Smart Technology, L.L.C., which bears interest at a 
rate of 12% per annum, is due upon consummation of this offering and evidences 
indebtness incurred to fund general working capital purposes; 

- repay $16,000 in interest on a note to Fairfax Management Company II, L.L.C., 
which bears interest at a rate of 5% per annum, the principal amount of which 
will be converted into our common stock upon consummation of this offering and 
evidences indebtedness incurred to repurchase shares of our common stock; and 

- fund general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements. 

To the extent we receive additional proceeds from this offering upon the 
exercise of the over-allotment option, we will use them to fund general 
corporate purposes and/or to redeem shares of our Class A and Class B Preferred 
Stock on a pro rata basis. As shares of Class A and Class B Preferred Stock are 
redeemed, the number of shares of Class A and Class B Preferred Stock that we 
will exchange into shares of our common stock will be reduced accordingly. 

The amounts borrowed under our existing credit facilities are due in full on 
August 24, 2001. The interest rate on indebtedness under the $26 million 
revolving credit facility is variable and ranges from the prime rate plus 0.25% 
to the prime rate plus 1.5% or from LIBOR plus 2.25% to LIBOR plus 3.5%. 
The $40 million revolving credit facility carries interest at the prime rate 
plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 2.5%. We intend to terminate the $40 million revolving 
credit facility following the consummation of this offering and amend the $26 
million revolving credit facility to provide for maximum aggregate revolving 
borrowings of up to $20 million. We will use amounts which may be reborrowed 
under the $20 million revolving credit facility following the consummation of 
this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including 
acquisitions. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations--Liquidity and capital resources"" for a discussion of 
our future liquidity. 

We anticipate that, in addition to the underwriting discounts and commissions, 
we will pay fees and expenses of approximately $2.7 million in connection with 
this offering. The principal components of that amount will be the fees and 
expenses of our accountants and attorneys, the costs of printing this prospectus
and other offering materials, The Nasdaq Stock Market listing fees and 
Securities and Exchange Commission and National Association of Securities 
Dealers filing fees."

A common stock and facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. 

Except as described below, we have no current specific plans for the net 
proceeds from this offering. We generally intend to use the proceeds of this 
offering to: 

- expand our computer systems; 

- develop Web site and ISP partnerships; 

- expand sales and marketing activities; 

- hire personnel; 

- finance potential acquisitions; and 

- fund other general corporate purposes. 

Other than as described below, we have not yet determined the actual expected 
expenditures and thus cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each purpose 
discussed above. The amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary 
significantly depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, 
the amount of cash generated by our operations and the market response to the 
introduction of any new service offerings. Accordingly, we will have broad 
discretion in the application of proceeds. 

We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to acquire or 
invest in businesses, products, services or technologies complementary to our 
current business, through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or otherwise. 
Under a non-binding commitment letter we have agreed to issue 80,083 shares of 
our Class A common stock and to pay $1,000,000 in cash in exchange for shares 
of the capital stock of B.A.K. Jina International, Inc. 

We intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-
bearing investment grade securities pending the foregoing uses."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. 

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and 
general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures for the expansion of 
our facilities and other infrastructure (approximately $7.2 million), growth 
and expansion of our business (approximately $14.4 million), product 
development (approximately $7.2 million) and acquisitions (approximately $14.4 
million). We currently expect to use approximately $2.5 million to repay 
outstanding indebtedness under our bank line of credit, which bears interest at 
7.75% and is due on June 30, 2000, shortly after completion of this offering. 
As of April 30, 1999, the outstanding balance of the line of credit was 
approximately $2.5 million. We have not identified other specific uses for such 
proceeds and management will have discretion over their use and investment. 
Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
investment grade, interest-bearing securities or guaranteed obligations of the 
U.S. Government. 

We intend to seek acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies that 
are complementary to us, and a portion of the net proceeds may be used for such 
acquisitions. While we discuss potential acquisitions from time to time, we 
currently have no commitments or agreements, other than the agreement and plan 
of merger for the University Netcasting merger, for any such acquisitions and 
there can be no assurances that any acquisitions will be made."

 assuming an initial public offering price of $10.00 per share. We will not 
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by Mr. DeMello as part of
 any over-allotment option exercise. 
We intend to use approximately $29 million to $35 million, or 70% to 85%, of the
 net proceeds of this offering to finance the expansion of our business. We
 expect to use the balance of the net proceeds, approximately $6 million to $12
 million, for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital
 expenditures. A portion of the net proceeds may also be used for the acquisition 
of businesses, products, services or technologies that are complementary to those 
of Streamline. There currently are no active negotiations, understandings, 
commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition. Pending such uses, we

price of $16.00 per share (approximately $50,466,000 if the underwriters' over-

discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

Viant is conducting this offering primarily to increase its equity capital, 
create a public market for its common stock and to facilitate future access by 
Viant to public equity markets. Viant intends to use the net proceeds of the 
offering for the repayment of approximately $3.3 million in principal debt 
outstanding plus accrued interest under a revolving line of credit and an 
equipment line of credit and the remainder for general corporate purposes, 
including capital expenditures and working capital. Borrowings under the 
revolving line of credit become due and payable on July 3, 1999 and bear 
interest at the bank's prime rate plus 0.5% per annum. Borrowings under the 
equipment line of credit are payable in 36 equal monthly installments and bear 
interest at the bank's prime rate plus 1.0% per annum. Borrowings under these 
bank lines of credit may be prepaid in whole or in part without penalty and are 
secured by substantially all of Viant's assets. In addition, Viant may, if 
appropriate opportunities arise, use an undetermined portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary companies, if the acquisition 
targets or investment opportunities have cultures and other attributes 
consistent with those of Viant. However, Viant is not currently discussing any 
such potential acquisition or investment with any third party. Pending such 
uses, Viant will invest the net proceeds in investment grade, interest-bearing

discount and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $83.0 million. 
Each share of Series A preferred stock will automatically convert into one

consummation of the offering. We expect to use approximately $4.3 million of 
the net proceeds from the offering to finance the construction and acquisition 
of towers, and for general working capital purposes. We may also use such net 
proceeds to finance acquisitions of other tower companies or other related 
businesses. In addition, we expect to use approximately $32.7 million of these 
net proceeds to pay all outstanding dividends on all outstanding shares of our 
Series A preferred stock and to redeem all outstanding shares of our Series B 
preferred stock. We also expect to use approximately $46.0 million to repay 
revolving credit borrowings under our senior credit facility. An affiliate of 
Lehman Brothers, one of the underwriters in the offering, is a lender under the 
senior credit facility. We have used borrowings under the senior credit 
facility to finance our business plan. The weighted average interest rate of 
revolving credit loans outstanding under the senior credit facility was 8.437% 
at March 31, 1999. The revolving credit loans mature on December 31, 2004. See

representatives' warrants) are exercised, the total proceeds to us from the 
exercise of the representatives' warrants and warrants included in all units to 
us will be $21,600,000 ($24,300,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised 
in full). We would expect to use the proceeds of warrant exercises to repay 
debt. In addition, we would use remaining proceeds from warrant exercises for 
further product development, such as the future enhancements described on page 
34, and related expenses, to purchase manufacturing equipment and expand our 
facilities and to build inventory and provide working capital, all in 
approximately the same relative percentages as set forth above. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest such funds in short-term 
bank deposits and investment grade securities, United States government 
securities, and other short-term, income-producing securities. 

The foregoing discussion is merely an estimate based on our current business 
plans. Our actual expenditures may vary depending upon circumstances not yet 
known, such as the time actually required to reach a positive cash flow, or to 
successfully develop our products. In addition, we expect to either repay the 
$2 million of our bridge financing which matures in December 1999 with proceeds 
of warrant exercises or of a new loan or to negotiate to convert it into 
preferred or common equity. To the extent that warrant exercise proceeds, the 
new loan or conversion is not available, we may use a portion of the net 
proceeds of the offering for repayment which would reduce application of the 
net proceeds to purchase equipment, build inventory and provide working capital 
and, if necessary, to conduct research and development. If a portion of the net 
proceeds were used to repay the bridge financing, we might need additional 
financing for equipment."

permit reborrowing of the $19.0 million after the offering. The acquisition 
term facility matures in January 2004. As of April 30, 1999 $19.0 million was 
outstanding under the acquisition term facility and an additional $239.0

Reduction of debt 

We expect to use proceeds to reduce debt as follows: 

. $6.6 million to repay BYL Bank Group for anticipated borrowings through the 
date of this prospectus. This debt bears interest at the annual rate of 6.6% 
and matures on July 31, 2000, except that it is required to be repaid upon a 
change of control of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Litronic Industries. It is 
guaranteed by Kris Shah, our chief executive officer and chairman of the board,
 and is secured by personal assets pledged by Mr. Shah. 

. $3.6 million to repay in full notes to Wilmington Trust Company. The 
Wilmington Trust Company debt bears interest at the prime rate as in effect 
from time to time and matures in December 2002. The Wilmington Trust Company 
debt is personally guaranteed by William W. Davis, Sr., our president and 
chief operating officer, and Lillian A. Davis, a principal stockholder, and is 
secured by property pledged by a family member of Mr. Davis. 

. $3.3 million to repay in full six promissory notes payable to various 
vendors, which bear interest at annual rates ranging from 10% to 18% and are 
due in June 1999. 

. $1.4 million to IBM Global Finance Corporation to reduce the amount 
outstanding under an asset-based inventory and working capital financing 
agreement. The financing line bears interest at an annual rate of prime plus 
2.375% and is guaranteed by Mr. Davis and Ms. Davis and secured by 
substantially all of the assets of Pulsar as well as by assets pledged by Mr. 
Davis and Ms. Davis. 

. $650,000 to pay IBM Global under its forbearance agreement with Pulsar which 
becomes payable upon closing of this offering. The obligations under the 
forbearance agreement are guaranteed by Mr. Davis and Ms. Davis and secured by 
assets pledged by Mr. Davis. 

. $450,000 to repay in full a line of credit from Fidelity Funding, Inc. 
The Fidelity Funding, Inc. debt currently bears interest at an annual rate of 
prime plus 1.5%, is due on February 28, 2000, and is personally guaranteed by 
Mr. Shah. 

Sales and marketing 
We expect to use the proceeds allocated to sales and marketing as follows: 

. to expand our sales and marketing efforts, primarily to commercial markets, 
including hiring approximately 20 additional sales and marketing personnel; 

. to open additional sales and support offices; 

. to expand our Internet and other advertising efforts; 

. to improve our web site; and 

. to expand strategic alliances. 

Product development 

We expect to use the proceeds allocated to product development to pay our 
estimated costs of software and product development, including compensation and 
benefits payable to additional software and hardware engineers and developers. 

Vendor settlements 

We expect to use the proceeds allocated to vendor settlements to pay amounts 
owed under litigation settlements with various Pulsar trade vendors, as well as 
anticipated amounts to pay as-yet-unsettled claims filed against Pulsar by 
other trade vendors. 

Working capital and general corporate purposes 

If our cash from operations proves to be insufficient to fund our outstanding 
trade payables, including up to approximately $2.9 million of accounts payable 
more than 90 days overdue, we may use a portion of the proceeds to fund these 
obligations. In addition, we may use a portion of the proceeds for potential 
acquisitions of technologies, product lines and businesses and to upgrade our 
existing management information systems and supporting information technology 
equipment. We currently have no commitments, understandings or arrangements 
with respect to any future acquisitions. 

If the representatives of the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option 
in full, we will realize additional net proceeds of approximately $5.6 million. 
We would use these proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this 
offering in U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit or other 
investment grade, interest-bearing securities. 

The allocations described above represent our best estimate of the anticipated 
use of the offering proceeds. Our estimate is based upon our operating plans 
and our assumptions about research and development progress, general economic 
conditions and industry factors. If any of these factors change, we may find it 
necessary or advisable to reallocate our use of proceeds. 

In addition to the proceeds of this offering, we expect to borrow under our new 
$20.0 million revolving line of credit facility with Fidelity Funding, Inc. as 
needed to finance our operations and working capital requirements. This 
facility provides for a three-year term, subject to one-year renewals at 
Fidelity's option, an annual interest rate of prime plus .625% and a pledge of 
substantially all of our personal and real property as collateral. 

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering, together with anticipated 
cash flow from operations, availability under our new $20.0 million credit 
facility and existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to satisfy 
our contemplated cash requirements for at least 12 months following the closing 
of this offering, including planned capital expenditures of $1.0 million and an 
anticipated increase in rent expense for our California operations of $400,000 
per year following our anticipated relocation of our California headquarters. 
We could be required to seek additional financing, however, if: 
. our plans change due to changes in market conditions, competitive factors, 
progress of our research and development efforts or new opportunities that may 
become available in the future; 

. our assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate; or 

. the net proceeds of this offering or our cash flows prove to be insufficient 
to finance our growth strategy."

stock being offered, at the initial public offering price of $11.00 per share, 
are estimated to be approximately $29,790,000 after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We 
expect to use the net proceeds: 

- to redeem our outstanding Series A preferred stock upon the closing of the 
offering for approximately $19.58 million (as of April 30, 1999); 

- to pay Telinnovation $2.96 million as a one-time fee in connection with the 
acquisition of certain of our technology; 

- to repay up to approximately $7.25 million in debt owed to BankBoston, N.A. 
as of April 30, 1999; and 

- for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and research 
and development. 

The interest rate on the BankBoston term loan as of April 30, 1999 was 8.25% 
(the current base rate of 7.75% plus 0.5%) and this debt will mature on 
December 31, 2002. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operation--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" The 
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the status of our product development and commercialization 
efforts, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering, the amount of 
cash generated by our operations, competition, and sales and marketing 
activities. If we receive substantially less net proceeds from this offering 
than we currently contemplate, then we may not repay some or all of our 
outstanding debt. Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, 
we intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term, investment-
grade, interest-bearing securities."

million if the over-allotment option is exercised in full. 

We intend to use approximately $2.9 million of the net proceeds of the offering 
to repay indebtedness, of which $2.0 million bears interest at prime rate plus 
4% per annum, and approximately $900,000 bears no interest. The $2.0 million 
line of credit matures on December 31, 1999 and the $900,000 loan is repaid at 
a rate of 2.5% of cumulative consolidated revenues in excess of $5.0 million. 
We are currently using the proceeds of this indebtedness for working capital. 
We expect to use the balance of the net proceeds from this offering for general 
corporate purposes. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to 
acquire complementary products, technologies or businesses. However, we 
currently have no commitments or agreements and are not involved in any 
negotiations with respect to any such transactions. Pending use of the net 
proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-
bearing, investment-grade securities. 

We are not limited in our use of the proceeds of this offering. We cannot 
predict that the investment of the proceeds in our operations and otherwise 
will yield a favorable return."

the sale of units, based upon our present planning, Internet industry 
conditions and our estimated future revenues and expenditures. We may change 
our intended use of such net proceeds in response to unanticipated events such 
as increased expenses, accelerated growth or stronger than anticipated 
competition, which may cause us to redirect our current priorities and 
re- allocate or use portions of such net proceeds for other purposes.

over-allotment option is exercised in full), at the initial public offering 
price of $9.00 per share. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund operating losses and 
for general corporate purposes, including expansion of our network, 
advertising, brand promotion, content development and working capital. We may 
also use a portion of the proceeds for strategic alliances and acquisitions and 
to repay debt. 

As of March 31, 1999, we had outstanding $2.8 million in principal amount of 
convertible notes and held binding commitments which would permit us to issue 
up to $3.5 million in additional convertible notes, all of which were issued 
prior to the completion of this offering. Upon the completion of this offering, 
up to $5.5 in million principal amount of such outstanding notes will be, at 
the option of each holder, convertible into common stock at a conversion price 
of $7.43 per share or redeemable for the principal amount plus accrued and 
unpaid interest at the rate of 7.0% per annum. For purposes of this prospectus, 
we have assumed that all outstanding notes are converted into common stock and 
thus do not require repayment in cash. To the extent any holder elects to 
receive cash, this will represent a use of the proceeds of this offering. 

We have not yet determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically

significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending

. approximately $1.0 million, representing our estimated expenses for this 
offering. 

We expect to use approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering to finance capital expenditures. We expect to use the remaining net 
proceeds to finance operating losses that we expect to incur as we expand our 
customer base and network and for general corporate purposes. The actual amount

. our future capital expenditures; and 

. the amount of cash generated by our operations. 

Many of these factors are beyond our control. Therefore, we will retain broad 
discretion in the use of the net proceeds. 

This use of proceeds does not reflect the underwriters' exercise of their over-
allotment option. We estimate that we will receive $8.8 million in additional 
net proceeds if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. 
We will not receive any of the proceeds from sales of shares by selling

of common stock at the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share after 
deducting underwriting commissions and discounts of $2,002,000 and estimated 
expenses of $850,000. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common 
stock by the selling shareholder. The principal purpose of this offering is to 
create a public market for the common stock of F5. 

We intend to use the proceeds of this offering for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, including increased expenditures for sales and marketing, 
research and development and professional services and technical support. We 
intend to use approximately $6.0 million from the net proceeds of this offering 
to expand our sales and marketing capabilities, approximately $5.0 million to 
fund increases in our research and development activities and approximately 
$3.0 million to expand our professional services and technical support 
capabilities. We may also use some of the proceeds for strategic acquisitions 
of products and technologies that will complement or extend our existing 
Internet traffic management solutions, although we are not currently planning 
any of these transactions. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds of the initial public offering in investment grade interest-bearing 
securities. 

The preceding allocations are only an estimate and the amounts that we actually 
expend for working capital and general corporate purposes will vary 
significantly depending on a number of factors, including future revenue growth 
and the amount of cash we generate from operations. As a result, we will retain 
broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds of this offering.

shareholders may not agree."""

be approximately $39 million (approximately $46 million if the underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) and after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We currently intend 
to use: 

- net proceeds of this offering for the repayment of our outstanding corporate 
debt which at March 31, 1999, was $9.5 million; and 

- between $7.4 million and $14.8 million of the net proceeds of this offering 
for the expansion of co-marketing programs with existing financial institution 
clients directed at their retail customers. 

We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds of this offering, between 
$14.7 million and $22.1 million, for general corporate purposes, including 
capital expenditures and working capital. At March 31, 1999, the corporate debt 
to be repaid included $8.0 million of loans, incurred for working capital 
purposes, which bear interest at 12.75% per annum and are due March 2003, and 
an equipment note of $1.5 million which bears interest at 9% per annum and is 
due June 1, 2000. We also may use net proceeds to pursue opportunities to 
invest in or acquire services, products, technologies or companies that 
complement or otherwise enhance our existing businesses. However, we currently 
have no understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any such 
acquisition. Pending use of the net proceeds for the above purposes, we intend 
to invest such funds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade 
obligations. 

The foregoing discussion represents our best estimate of the allocation of the 
net proceeds of this offering based upon our current plans. Actual expenditures
 may vary substantially from these estimates and we may find it necessary or 
advisable to reallocate the net proceeds within the above-described categories 
or to use portions thereof for other purposes."

stock offered through this prospectus (after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses) of $62.1 million ($71.7 
million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full). 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes. While we have not determined specifically how the proceeds will be 
allocated, we are conducting this offering at this time because we believe the 
proceeds from this offering will be required for the development and expansion 
of our business over the next two years and to enable us to compete against 
other investment banking firms with much larger capital bases than we currently 
have. The general corporate purposes for which we expect to use the net 
proceeds of this offering include expanding our investment banking staff and 
our sales and marketing capabilities, expanding our investment research 
department, launching our digital trading facility, working capital 
requirements and making investments, as appropriate, in the Angel Funds we plan 
to establish. A portion of the net proceeds may possibly be used for 
proprietary trading in support of our investment banking business and for 
strategic acquisitions or investments. The proceeds of this offering will 
generally help us cover operating costs, including compensation for 
professionals, at a time when our revenues are growing but are not sufficient 
to cover our costs. Finally, as we expand our underwriting, trading and other 
market activities, we will need to maintain larger capital balances under 
applicable regulatory requirements. 

The foregoing represents our present intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions. The occurrence of unforeseen events or changed 
business conditions, however, could result in the application of the proceeds 
of this offering in a manner other than as described in this prospectus."

offering will be approximately $34.1 million. This is based upon an initial 
public offering price of $10.00 per share and after deducting estimated 
underwriting fees and expenses payable by us estimated at $4.0 million. We will 
receive additional net proceeds of up to approximately $8.5 million if the 
underwriters exercise the option granted to them in connection with this 
offering to purchase additional shares of our stock to cover over-allotments. 
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling 
shareholders. 

We plan to use $15.0 million of the proceeds from this offering to repay bank 
debt, $13.0 million to open our new distribution center and additional stores, 
$2.0 million to implement new enterprise software and the balance for other 
working capital and general corporate purposes. Our bank debt consists of a 
$35.0 million revolving credit facility. At May 1, 1999, the outstanding 
balance under our credit facility was $12.4 million. Borrowings under the 
credit facility bear interest at variable rates, and the weighted average 
interest rate at May 1, 1999 was 7.75%. Although the initial term of the credit 
facility expires on October 8, 2000, it is anticipated that our current credit 
facility will be replaced promptly after completion of this offering with a new 
$30.0 million revolving credit facility. See ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and 
Capital Resources."" A portion of the proceeds from this offering may be used to 
implement an internet shopping site. We may also use a portion of the proceeds 
to acquire other companies. Although Zany Brainy from time to time is engaged 
in negotiations related to possible acquisitions, no agreements relating to 
acquisitions are pending. 

Pending uses of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short
-term investment grade securities."

shares of common stock offered by Capital Environmental through this 
prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses, of $29.1 million, or $34.1 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. Capital 
Environmental will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common 
stock in this offering by the selling shareholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding 
indebtedness under our credit facility. Our credit facility provides for 
borrowing capacity of up to $70.0 million, of which approximately $66.5 million 
was outstanding as of May 15, 1999. Of this outstanding amount, $26.5 million 
consisted of U.S. dollar loans bearing interest at 7.6% and $40.0 million 
consisted of Canadian dollar loans bearing interest at 7.3%. Our credit 
facility will terminate in January 2002 at which time its entire principal 
amount will become due. The credit facility is used for acquisitions of 
businesses in the solid waste services industry that meet our acquisition 
criteria. While we continuously and actively evaluate acquisition candidates, 
we are not presently negotiating any probable acquisitions. In addition, the 
proceeds of our credit facility are used for capital expenditures, standby 
letter of credit and general corporate purposes. The proceeds of our credit 
facility were used to repay a $14.7 million loan from Dresdner Bank Canada and 
to redeem common stock. The terms of our credit facility permit us, subject to 
some restrictions, to redraw on the facility for future acquisitions, capital 
expenditures and general corporate purposes. The repayment of our debt under 
the credit facility using the proceeds of this offering may be temporary and we 
do not expect any permanent decrease in our interest expense in the near 
future."

offering are estimated to be $62.3 million, based upon the initial public 
offering price of $12.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses of $9.7 million payable by iXL.
 If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the net 
proceeds to iXL are estimated to be $72.3 million. The principal purposes of 
this offering are to obtain additional capital and to create a public market 
for iXL's common stock, which will facilitate future access by iXL to the 
public equity markets. iXL expects to use approximately $10 million of these 
net proceeds to repay all indebtedness under iXL's credit facility, except for 
a $10 million revolving credit facility which will remain available. The 
maturity date for this indebtedness is June 30, 2001, and as of April 30, 1999, 
the interest rate on the outstanding amount was 9.75%. No debt will be 
outstanding under this credit facility after this repayment, although the $10 
million revolving credit facility will remain available. iXL will have 
significant discretion in the use of the remaining net proceeds of this 
offering for general corporate purposes. 

The net proceeds to iXL from the sale of an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of 
common stock to General Electric are estimated to be $23.3 million, based upon 
a purchase price of $12.00 per share, after deducting estimated advisory fees 
of $500,000 and offering expenses of $200,000 payable by iXL. iXL expects to 
use these net proceeds for general corporate purposes, and will have 
significant discretion in their use. 

iXL regularly evaluates potential domestic and international acquisition 
candidates, and is currently holding preliminary discussions with a number of 
candidates. If, after due diligence review and negotiation, companies can be 
acquired on a basis considered fair to iXL and its stockholders, iXL may 
proceed with an acquisition. No potential acquisitions are currently considered 
to be pending or probable. iXL intends to file a ""shelf"" Registration Statement 
on Form S-4 to register 4,000,000 shares of its common stock for use in future 
acquisitions. iXL expects most of its future joint ventures or acquisitions to 
involve the issuance of additional shares of its common stock. To the extent 
iXL chooses to use cash as consideration for future acquisitions, iXL may use 
the proceeds from this offering or it may obtain additional financing. 

Pending use of the net proceeds for the above purposes, iXL intends to invest 
such funds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade obligations. See

(1) Such funds will primarily be used for expenses incurred in the opening of 
new offices, including leasing office space, purchasing or leasing office
 equipment and computer hardware and related expenses prior to the commencement 
of operations in new locations. The Company estimates that opening a new office 
will cost approximately $200,000 to $500,000 per location, which costs will 
vary depending on the size of the office and the cost of doing business in the 
location in question. The Company expects to open the majority of its new 
offices in the United States. As part of its expansion plan, the Company may 
utilize a portion of these proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, 
complementary or competitive companies in these new locations. The Company has 
not currently identified any acquisition or investment candidates and has no 
agreements, plans or arrangements with respect to any such acquisition or 
investments. 

(2) Such funds will represent the Company's capital contribution to a joint 
venture with Great Lakes for the continued development and commercialization of 
AppTracker. Such capital contribution will be utilized for continued 
development and testing costs and, if such testing is successful, to provide 
funds for the initial marketing of the product. See ""Business--Information 
Technology and the Internet."" 

The net proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the Underwriters' over-
allotment option, if any, will be utilized for general corporate and working 
capital purposes. 

Pending their use, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in high-
quality, short-term, interest bearing U.S. government obligations. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the sale of the Shares based upon the Company's currently 
contemplated operations, the Company's business plan and current economic and 
industry conditions and is subject to reapportionment among the categories 
listed above in response to, among other things, changes in its plans, 
regulations, industry conditions and future revenues and expenditures. The 
amount and timing of expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors, 
including changes in the Company's contemplated operations or business plan and 
changes in economic and industry conditions. 

Based on the Company's operating plans, the Company believes that the net 
proceeds of this offering, together with available cash and anticipated 
revenues from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's working 
capital requirements for a period of at least the next 18 months following the 
completion of this Offering. This belief is based on certain assumptions, which 
may prove to be incorrect. After such 18-month period, or sooner if the 
Company's assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company may require additional 
capital in order to meet its then current plans for expansion and capital 
requirements. Such financing may take the form of public or private common or 
preferred equity securities or debt securities, or may involve bank financing. 
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional 
capital on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. In any of such 
events, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion.
