The actual amounts to be invested in differentinstruments will depend on the interest rate environment and New North PennBancorpâ€™s liquidity requirements. In the future, New North Penn Bancorp mayliquidate its investments and use those funds: â€¢  to pay dividends to shareholders;â€¢  to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory restrictions;                                                             â€¢  to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions or other       businesses that are related to banking; and                               â€¢  for general corporate purposes.Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, New North Penn Bancorpmay not repurchase shares of its common stock during the first year followingcompletion of the conversion and offering, except to fund equity benefit plansother than stock options or, with prior regulatory approval, when extraordinarycircumstances exist. North Penn Bank initially intends to invest the proceeds it receives from theoffering, which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to NorthPenn Bank, in short-term, liquid investments. Over time, North Penn Bank may usethe proceeds that it receives from the offering:â€¢ to fund new loans;â€¢ to repay outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances;                                       â€¢ to invest in securities;â€¢ to finance the possible expansion of its business activities, including     developing new branch locations; and                                      â€¢ for general corporate purposes.We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listedabove.We currently do not have any specific plans for any expansion or diversificationactivities, including adding branch locations or acquiring other financialinstitutions. Consequently, we currently anticipate that the proceeds of theoffering contributed to North Penn Bank initially will be used to fund newloans. We expect that much of the loan growth will occur in our commercial realestate portfolio, which we have emphasized in recent periods, but we have notallocated specific dollar amounts to any particular area of our portfolio. Theamount of time that it will take to deploy the proceeds of the offering intoloans will depend primarily on the level of loan demand. In the absence of loandemand, we anticipate that we will use a portion of the proceeds contributed toNorth Penn Bank to repay outstanding overnight advances from the Federal HomeLoan Bank.Except as described above, neither New North Penn Bancorp nor North Penn Bankhas any specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of the offering andhas not allocated a specific portion of the proceeds to any particular use."

For fiscal 2007 and fiscal2008, we have budgeted an aggregate of $28.0 million to $34.0 million for newstore openings although the actual amounts that we spend on such items may vary.As a result, we will retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceedsfrom this offering.

A portion of the net proceeds may be used topartially repay our $15.0 million secured non-recourse promissory note maturingin December 2007, which would be reduced to approximately $11.9 million as ofJune 30, 2007, including accrued interest at the rate of 6% per annum, afterapplying the escrowed funds associated with our Abbokinase sales throughJune 30, 2007, if we are unable to secure additional significant sales ofAbbokinase to our third party distributors or to refinance the promissory notewith Abbott Laboratories. We will use a portion of the net proceeds from thisoffering to repay the promissory note only if, at the time of such repayment, weanticipate sales of Abbokinase sufficient to replenish our cash resources so asnot to affect our planned expenditures under our then-current operating plan.Additionally, a portion of the net proceeds may be used to acquire or invest incomplementary businesses, technologies, services or products. We have no currentplans, agreements or commitments with respect to any such material acquisitionor investment, and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respectto any such transaction. Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this offeringwill be invested in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

We expect this    greenfield project will start producing ethanol in fiscal year 2009 and reach    full production in fiscal year 2012, with an expected crushing capacity of 10    million tons of sugarcane and total ethanol production of approximately 240    million gallons (900 million liters) per year;          â€¢  US$500 million in capital expenditures relating to the expansion of existing    facilities, which will add an estimated 10.6 million tons of additional    crushing capacity by fiscal year 2012;                         â€¢  US$325 million in the development of our cogeneration systems for our Gasa,    Univalem, Diamante, Ipaussu and Barra mills;                        â€¢  US$100 million to purchase mechanical harvesters for approximately 80% of    the sugarcane we cultivate by fiscal year 2012, reducing production costs    and emissions, and profiting from the non-burned extra biomass; and       â€¢  US$50 million to increase crop yields and enhance efficiency, as well to     reduce production costs.                                                  The total expenditures for the above projects are estimated to be approximatelyUS$1,625 million, of which we expect to fund approximately US$1,009.1 with thenet proceeds from the global offering.The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of the netproceeds from the global offering:                  Sources:                                        Uses:                                                    (in millions of US$)                                                                                                              Class A common shares                            Greenfield project            offered in the global                            in the State of GoiÃ¡s         offering                         US$ 1,009.1                                     US$435.0                                                 Expansion of existing                                                          facilities                         290.0                                                 Cogeneration                       175.0                                                 Acquisition of mechanical                                                      harvesters                          59.1                                                 Increase crop yields,                                                          enhance efficiency and                                                         reduce production costs             50.0                                                                                                                                                                    Total sources of funds           US$ 1,009.1     Total uses of funds           US$1,009.1                                                                                         We will fund the remaining approximately US$615.9 million for the above projectsusing cash flows from operations, debt financings or, possibly, future equityofferings.

If the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate thatour net proceeds will be approximately $1,033.0 million.We currently intend to use the net proceeds:â€¢   to repay $350.0 million of our intercompany indebtedness owed to EMC;â€¢   to purchase from EMC our new headquarters facilities for an amount equal to    the cost expended by EMC to date in constructing the facilities, which         totaled approximately $127.0 million, which purchase will be effected          through the transfer of the equity interests of the EMC entity which holds     the rights to the facilities; and                                          â€¢   for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to         finance our growth, develop new products and fund capital expenditures and     potential acquisitions.                                                    The intercompany indebtedness was incurred in April 2007 to fund an $800 milliondividend paid to EMC in the form of a note. The note matures in April 2012 andbears an interest rate of the 90-day LIBOR plus 55 basis points (5.91% as ofJune 30, 2007), with interest payable quarterly in arrears commencing June 30,2007. The note may be repaid, without penalty, at any time commencing July 2007.The dividend was declared to allow EMC to realize the increased value of itsinvestment in us from the time of our acquisition by EMC. The amount of thedividend was determined by reference to EMCâ€™s tax basis in our common stock sothat the dividend would not result in the recognition of any income by EMC forU.S. federal income tax purposes. The terms of the note were determined byconsidering our then-existing cash position, our historic and future ability togenerate cash flows from operations and the likelihood that we would be able topay the note pursuant to its terms while still having sufficient cash to meetour operating needs. We currently do not anticipate declaring cash dividends inthe future. We have chosen to use a portion of the proceeds from this offeringto repay $350.0 million of our intercompany indebtedness owed to EMC because ourexpected cash position following the offering will allow us to pay down aportion of the note without incurring interest while still having sufficientcash to meet our anticipated operating needs. The purchase price of ourheadquarters facilities was determined as a means to compensate EMC for costs itexpended on our behalf in the construction of the facilities.We may pursue the acquisition of companies with complementary products andtechnologies that we believe will enhance our suite of offerings. In April 2007,we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of aprivately-held offshore software development company for aggregate cashconsideration of less than $10 million. Other than this agreement, we do nothave agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time.Pending the use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceedsin a variety of capital preservation investments, generally governmentsecurities and cash."

This advance will be repaid      out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon      consummation of this offering.(2)   The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain      constant at $25,000 even if the underwriters' over-allotment option is      exercised. In addition, $3,000,000 of interest income earned on the amounts      held in the trust account will be available to us to pay for our working      capital requirements potentially including the items described above. For      purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the      total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the      offering.(3)   The miscellaneous expenses may include deposits or down payments for a      proposed initial business combination, director and officer liability      insurance premiums, brokers' retainer fees, consulting fees, finders' fees      and fees payable to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company for serving      as trustee and our transfer agent.    A total of approximately $292.75 million (or approximately $336.1 million ifthe underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), of the netproceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsors' warrants described inthis prospectus, including $9.75 million (or approximately $11.2 million if theunderwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions will be placed in a trust account at        with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. Except fora portion of the interest income that may be released to us, or used to paytaxes, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust accountuntil the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination or ourliquidation. All amounts held in the trust account that are not converted tocash or released to us as interest income, or used to pay taxes, will bereleased promptly after closing of our initial business combination with one ormore target businesses which collectively have a fair market value of at least80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding deferred underwritingdiscounts and commissions of $9.75 million or approximately $11.2 million if theunderwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the time of suchbusiness combination, subject to a majority of our public stockholders voting infavor of the initial business combination and less than 30% of the publicstockholders electing to exercise their conversion rights and subject to suchdeferred underwriting discounts and commissions having been paid to theunderwriters. We will only consummate a business combination in which we becomethe controlling shareholder of the target. The key factor that we will rely onin determining controlling shareholder status would be our acquisition of atleast 51% of the voting equity interests of the target company. We will notconsider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Upon release of fundsfrom the trust account and after payment of the conversion price to any publicstockholders who exercise their conversion rights, the underwriters will receivetheir deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, and the remaining fundswill be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchaseprice of the business or businesses with which our initial combination occurs.If the initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities,we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account to general corporatepurposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquiredbusiness or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtednessincurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchaseof other companies, or for working capital.    We have agreed to pay Hanover Group US LLC, an entity affiliated with MarkKlein, our chief executive officer and president, a total of $10,000 per monthfor office space, administrative services and secretarial support. Thisarrangement is being agreed to by Hanover Group US LLC for our benefit and isnot intended to provide Mark Klein or Paul Lapping compensation in lieu of asalary or other remuneration because it is anticipated that the expenses to bepaid by Hanover Group US LLC will approximate the monthly reimbursement. Webelieve that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained froman unaffiliated person. Upon completion of an initial business combination orour liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.    We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will beperformed by some or all of the members of our management team and may includeengaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. No compensationof any kind, including finder's and consulting fees, will be paid to any of ourinitial stockholders, sponsors, officers or directors, or to any of theirrespective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with theconsummation of an initial business combination, other than a total of $10,000per month for office space and administrative services, including secretarialsupport. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocketexpenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such asidentifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitablebusiness combinations. Our audit committee will review and approve all expensereimbursements made to our initial stockholders, sponsors, officers or directorsand their respective affiliates (other than the $10,000 monthly paymentdescribed above) and any payments made to members of our audit committee will bereviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the interested director ordirectors abstaining from such review and approval.    We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income ofup to $3.0 million earned on the trust account balance that may be released tous subject to the tax holdback (as described in more detail below) will besufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated.This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertakenonly after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminaryagreement that addresses the terms of an initial business combination. Althoughwe do not know the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account and areunable to predict an exact amount of time it will take to complete any initialbusiness combination, we believe that following the completion of this offering,it will take a significant amount of time to find a prospective target businessand take all of the steps necessary to complete an initial business combination.We anticipate that, even at an interest rate of 3% per annum, the interest thatwill accrue on the trust account during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. Given the limited amount of time it will take to generate$3.0 million of interest on the trust account, we anticipate receiving such interest income generally shortly after we incur working capital expenses. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or if interest payments are not available to fund the expenses at the time we incur them, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,or invest in, us. To the extent that our expenses exceed the amounts not held inthe trust account and the interest income of up to $3.0 million that may be released to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. Since therole of our officers and directors after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to current officers and directors after our initial business combination. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred bythem that have not been reimbursed by us prior to the closing of our initialbusiness combination. If the owners of the target business do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our officers and directors to view such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in a potential conflict of interest.    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect an initial business combination, the proceeds held inthe trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used tofinance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds couldbe used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the targetbusiness' operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research anddevelopment of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repayany operating expenses or finders' fees which we had incurred prior to thecompletion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside ofthe trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.    As of the date of this prospectus, Mark Klein has advanced to us a total of$175,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offeringreferenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, NASDregistration fee, American Stock Exchange fee and accounting and legal fees.These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier ofFebruary 25, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaidout of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust and interestreleased from the trust."

We intend to use all of the netproceeds we receive from this offering to repay a portion of our outstandingindebtedness under our second lien term loan facility, our revolving creditfacility or a combination of the foregoing. Under the terms of our second lienterm loan facility, we are obligated to use not less than 50% of our netproceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our secondlien term loan facility. Currently, we expect to use half of the net proceeds torepay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our second lien term loanfacility and the remaining half of the net proceeds to repay a portion of ouroutstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. We may, however,allocate a greater portion of the net proceeds to repay a portion of ouroutstanding indebtedness under our second lien term loan facility based on therelative interest rates of our revolving credit facility and our second lienterm loan facility and our anticipated capital needs at the time of closing ofthis offering.

We incurred borrowings of approximately$421.0 million under our revolving credit facility in connection with thecombination transaction in February 2006 to pay the cash purchase price of$400.0 million to the Chase Group, $15.9 million to repay the balance on theprior revolving credit facility of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. andapproximately $5.1 million for bank fees and legal costs associated with ourrevolving credit facility.

The remaining $75.1 million ofborrowings as of March 31, 2007 under our revolving credit facility were usedfor working capital and to fund a portion of our exploration and developmentdrilling program. Our second lien term loan facility currently bears interest at9.10% per annum and matures on March 27, 2012. We used the borrowings from oursecond lien term loan facility of $199.0 million to repay the $39.8 millionoutstanding under our prior term loan facility, to reduce the outstandingbalance under our revolving credit facility by $154.0 million and the remaining$5.2 million to pay loan fees, accrued interest and for general corporatepurposes. Certain affiliates of the underwriters to this offering are lenders under oursecond lien term loan facility and our revolving credit facility and willreceive a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this offering based on theamount of the loans they have extended under these bank credit facilities.

expenses, including the SEC                 registration fee, the NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the          American Stock Exchange filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit           fees, have been or will be paid from the funds advanced by Dr. Krauss             described below. These advances will be repaid, without interest, out of the      proceeds of this offering available to us.                                  (2)   No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the      private placement warrants. $3,600,000, or $4,140,000 if the over-allotment       option is exercised in full, of the underwriting discounts and commissions        will be deposited in trust following the consummation of the offering and is      payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a business             combination.                                                                 (3)   The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain       constant at $100,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition,        $1,900,000 of interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust             account will be available to us to pay for our working capital requirements.      For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as         the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the        offering.                                                                   In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our officers, directorsand certain of our special advisors have committed to purchase the privateplacement warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $2,075,000) from us.These purchases will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously withthe consummation of this offering. We will not pay any discounts or commissionswith respect to the purchase of the private placement warrants. All of theproceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in the trust accountdescribed below.$114,575,000, or $131,855,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $2,075,000 we will receive from thesale of the private placement warrants, will be placed in a trust account atLehman Brothers Inc., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,New York, New York, as trustee. These amounts include $3,600,000, or $4,140,000if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of theunderwriting discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in thisoffering. The underwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unlessand until we consummate a business combination and have waived their right toreceive such payment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete abusiness combination. The funds held in trust will be invested only in UnitedStates â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of theInvestment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or inmoney market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated underthe Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be aninvestment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect tointerest income that may be released to us of (i) up to $1,900,000 to fundexpenses related to investigating and selecting a target business and our otherworking capital requirements and (ii) any additional amounts we may need to payour income or other tax obligations, the proceeds held in trust will not bereleased from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of abusiness combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust accountmay be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with whichwe complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to thesellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the targetbusiness.The payment to KBL Healthcare Management, an affiliate of Drs. Berk and Kraussand Mr. Kaswan, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrativeservices including office space, utilities and secretarial support. Thisarrangement is being agreed to by KBL Healthcare Management for our benefit andis not intended to provide Drs. Berk and Krauss and Mr. Kaswan compensation inlieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services inthe New York City metropolitan area, that the fee charged by KBL HealthcareManagement is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from anunaffiliated third party. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of abusiness combination or the distribution of the trust account to our publicstockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month administrative fee, nocompensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s, consulting or other similar fees)will be paid to any of our officers, directors, existing stockholders, or any oftheir affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order toeffectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the typeof transaction that it is). However, these persons will receive reimbursementfor out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on ourbehalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business duediligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well astraveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospectivetarget businesses to examine their operations.Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the netproceeds from this offering that are not deposited in the trust accountavailable to us for our search for a business combination will be approximately$100,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,up to $1,900,000, may be released to us to fund our working capitalrequirements. These funds will be used by us for director and officer liabilityinsurance premiums, due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses ofstructuring and negotiating business combinations, as well as for reimbursementof any out-of-pocket expenses incurredby our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf asdescribed above. We will also be entitled to have interest earned on the fundsheld in the trust account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we mayowe. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expensesand reimbursement costs. We could also use a portion of these funds to pay feesto consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or to use as adown payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision (a provision in letters of intentdesigned to keep target businesses from â€œshoppingâ€ù around for transactions withother companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respectto a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have anycurrent intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paidfor the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount thatwould be used as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would bedetermined based on the terms of the specific business combination and theamount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whetheras a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not havingsufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence withrespect to, potential target businesses.The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the eventthat our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of suchproceeds within the above described categories.We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business andto pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock isused in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, theproceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a businesscombination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with anyother net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance theoperations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in avariety of ways including continuing or expanding the target businessâ€™operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research anddevelopment of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repayany operating expenses or findersâ€™ fees which we had incurred prior to thecompletion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside ofthe trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will paythe costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.If such funds are insufficient, certain of our initial stockholders have agreedto advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currentlyanticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not toseek repayment of such expenses.Marlene Krauss, our chief executive officer, has advanced to us $100,000 whichwas used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in theline items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, the non-refundableportion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, and a portion of the legaland audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on theearlier of February 5, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loan willbe repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment ofoffering expenses.We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from thetrust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a businesscombination is not consummated during that time.A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned, net of taxes payable, on his, her or its portion ofthe trust account) only in the event of our liquidation or if that publicstockholder converts such shares into cash in connection with a businesscombination which the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate.In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interestof any kind to or in the trust account.Upon the consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters willbe entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust accountattributable to the deferred underwritersâ€™ discounts and commissions held in thetrust account (subject to a $0.24 per share reduction for public stockholderswho vote against our initial business combination and exercise their conversionrights)."

If the underwriters exercise their option topurchase an additional 1,245,000 shares in full, then the net proceeds will beapproximately $136.2 million.    Based on the initial public offering price, we intend to use the proceedsfrom the offering, and the estimated net proceeds of approximately $51.5 millionfrom the Shinsei Investment (i) to redeem approximately $132.1 million of NewClass A Units held by the existing unitholders of D&P Acquisitions, of whichamount we expect approximately $55.6 million will be paid to Vestar and itsaffiliates, approximately $33.5 million will be paid to Lovell Minnick and itsaffiliates, approximately $3.6 million will be paid to Mr. Gottdiener,approximately $1.1 million to Mr. Creagh, approximately $0.7 million toMr. Silverman, approximately $0.2 million to Mr. Marschke, approximately$0.1 million to Mr. Forman and approximately $0.2 million to Mr. Krueger, and(ii) to repay $37.1 million outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement.If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase an additional 1,245,000shares in full, we will redeem approximately $140.2 million of New Class A Unitsheld by the existing unitholders, (including approximately $5.1 million toMr. Gottdiener, approximately $1.5 million to Mr. Creagh, approximately$1.0 million to Mr. Silverman, approximately $0.3 million to Mr. Marschke,approximately $0.1 million to Mr. Forman and approximately $0.2 million toMr. Krueger) and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes,which may include repayment of outstanding borrowings under our creditagreement. We do not anticipate significant short-term capital needs, whichallows us to apply a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to theRedemption. The Redemption will provide the existing unitholders of D&PAcquisitions with the opportunity to monetize a portion of their holdings in D&PAcquisitions.    Our credit agreement consists of a revolving credit facility in the amountof $20.0 million and a term loan facility in the amount of $80.0 million. Therevolving credit facility matures on October 1, 2011 and the term loan facilitymatures on October 1, 2012. At June 30, 2007, we had outstanding borrowings of$79.0 million under the term loan facility (before debt discount) bearinginterest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%. Proceeds from theseborrowings have been used to acquire the CVC and Chanin businesses and forworking capital purposes. At June 30, 2007, there was no outstanding loanbalance under the revolving credit facility."

We willnot receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the sellingstockholder. We will not receive any additional proceeds if the underwritersexercise the option to purchase additional shares because only sellingstockholders will sell additional shares if the option to purchase additionalshares is exercised. The principal reasons for this offering are to obtain additional capital, tocreate a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future accessto public equity markets. As a result, we believe we will be better able toaddress our various strategic initiatives and respond to changes in our industrythan we otherwise would as a private company. We currently estimate that of the net proceeds we receive from this offering wewill spend approximately $32.7 million to repay the following indebtednessoutstanding as of June 30, 2007, plus accrued but unpaid interest and prepaymentpenalties thereon:     â€¢  approximately $8.9 million in aggregate principal and interest under our          working capital line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB;                  â€¢  approximately $1.3 million in aggregate principal, interest and prepayment        penalties under our equipment line of credit with Bank of America, N.A., or       Bank of America;                                                                  â€¢  approximately $4.7 million in aggregate principal, interest and prepayment        penalties under our equipment line of credit with Oxford Finance                  Corporation, or Oxford;                                                           â€¢  approximately $0.3 million in aggregate principal, interest and prepayment        penalties under our equipment line of credit with General Electric Capital        Corporation; and                                                                  â€¢  approximately $17.5 million in aggregate principal, interest and prepayment       penalties under our term loans with ORIX Venture Finance LLC, or ORIX.      Our working capital line of credit currently bears interest at a per annum rateequal to SVBâ€™s prime rate, which was 8.25% as of June 30, 2007, matures onAugust 31, 2008. Our equipment line of credit with Bank of America currentlybears interest at per annum rate equal to the greater of 9% or the Bank ofAmericaâ€™s prime rate, which was 8.25% as of June 30, 2007, plus 3.75%, matureson December 1, 2008 and may be prepaid with a 1% penalty. Our equipment line ofcredit with Oxford currently bears interest at 10.73% per annum, matures onDecember 1, 2009 and may be prepaid with a 2%-3% penalty if prepayment occursprior within 90 days of the effectiveness of this registration statement. Ourequipment line of credit with General Electric Capital Corporation currentlybears interest at 8.49% per annum, matures on March 1, 2008 and may be prepaidwith a 3% penalty if prepayment occurs prior to December 1, 2007. Each of ourterm loans with ORIX currently bears interest at prime, which was 8.25% as ofJune 30, 2007, plus 1.75% per annum, matures on June 30, 2010, and may beprepaid in whole or in part with a prepayment penalty equal to 3% of the amountprepaid if prepayment occurs prior to December 28, 2007. We used the proceedsfrom indebtedness incurred during the past year to acquire equipment and forother general working capital purposes. We anticipate that we will use the remaining net proceeds we receive from thisoffering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including thefunding of our marketing activities and further investment in the development ofour service offerings. Other than the repayment of indebtedness, we have notallocated any specific portion of the net proceeds to any particular purpose,and our management will have the discretion to allocate the proceeds as itdetermines. We may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition ofbusinesses, products and technologies that we believe are complementary to ourown, although we have no agreements or understandings with respect to anyacquisition at this time.Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest thenet proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-gradesecurities. This expected use of the net proceeds of this offering represents our currentintentions based upon our present plans and business condition. The amounts andtiming of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, includingcash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business. We willretain broad discretion in the allocation and use of our net proceeds."

five loans (of which $75,000 was funded on May 28, 2005, $15,000 was funded      on July 6, 2006, $15,000 was funded on November 6, 2006, $6,500 was funded on    March 1, 2007 and $29,000 was funded on June 25, 2007) (each of which bears      interest at a 6% annual rate) made to us by InterAmerican Advisors, LLC and      $140,500 of cash proceeds from the offering will repay the principal balance     to InterAmerican Advisors, LLC.                                              (2) The underwriters are entitled to receive a fee equal to 6% ($0.48 per unit)      of each unit sold in the offering and a non-accountable expense allowance        equal to 2% ($0.16 per unit) of each unit sold in the offering. However, the     underwriters have agreed to defer a portion of their underwriting fees in an     amount equal to 4.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering, or $0.36 per        unit ($1,800,000 in total, or $2,070,000 if the over-allotment option is         exercised), until the consummation of a business combination. Upon the           consummation of a business combination, we will pay such deferred fees out of    the proceeds of this offering held in trust (and then only with respect to       those units as to which the component shares have not been redeemed). If we      do not consummate a business combination, then these fees shall not be paid      to the underwriters and such amount shall remain in the trust account            available to the stockholders upon a liquidation.                            (3) Miscellaneous expenses include $59,110 of travel and out-of-pocket expenses      incurred in connection with the offering by our officers and directors           through the balance sheet date.                                              (4) Interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable) up to a maximum      amount of $950,000 will be released to us to fund our working capital            requirements. Accordingly, for purposes of this presentation we have assumed     a total of $1,300,000 to be available to us outside the trust.               (5) Interest on the $111,500 of loans to us by InterAmerican Advisors, LLC that      were outstanding as of the balance sheet date was $10,436. Interest on these     loans and a subsequent loan of $29,000 from InterAmerican Advisors, LLC that     was made on June 25, 2007 accrue at an annual rate of 6%. Any down payment or    lock-up payment would be limited to the amount allocated to excess working       capital.                                                                     (6) We currently estimate that we would require a approximately $50,000 to           $75,000 to implement our stockholder approved plan of dissolution and            distribution in the event we do not consummate a business combination. To the    extent such funds are not available, the principals of InterAmerican Capital     Partners II LLC have agreed to advance us the necessary funds and have agreed    not to seek repayment for such expenses. However, there can be no assurance      that they will be able to meet their obligations under this agreement.       $39,250,000, or $45,160,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option isexercised in full, of net proceeds (which includes $1,500,000 of proceeds fromthe warrant purchase commitment of InterAmerican Capital Partners II LLC and oneof our special advisors) will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NYBank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, NewYork, as trustee. The underwriters have agreed to defer and place into the trusta portion of their underwriting fees in an amount equal to 4.5% of the grossproceeds of this offering, or $0.36 per unit ($1,800,000 in total, or $2,070,000if the over-allotment option is exercised), until the consummation of a businesscombination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, we will pay suchdeferred fees out of the proceeds of this offering held in trust (and then onlywith respect to those units as to which the component shares have not beenredeemed). The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until theearlier of the completion of a business combination or as part of any plan ofdissolution and distribution approved by our stockholders which would includeliquidation of our trust account. Other than interest income up to a maximumamount of $950,000 that will be released to us to fund our working capitalrequirements, the proceeds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable andexclusive of any funds held for the benefit of the underwriters) may be used asconsideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete abusiness combination. The payment to InterAmerican Advisors, LLC, an affiliate of William C. Morro,our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chairman of our boardof directors and Dr. Richard N. Sinkin, our chief operating officer, secretaryand a member of our board of directors, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is forgeneral and administrative services including office space, utilities andsecretarial support in our office located in San Diego. This arrangement isbeing agreed to by InterAmerican Advisors, LLC for our benefit and is notintended to provide Messrs. Morro and Sinkin compensation in lieu of a salary.We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the metropolitanarea of San Diego, that the fee charged by InterAmerican Advisors, LLC is atleast as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Uponthe earlier to occur of (i) completion of a business combination or(ii) 12 months from the completion of this offering, we will no longer berequired to pay this monthly fee.Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option infull, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for abusiness combination will be approximately $350,000. In addition, we have agreedwith Chardan Capital Markets, LLC that the interest earned on the trust account(net of taxes payable) up to a maximum of $950,000 will be released to us tofund our working capital requirements and will also be available to us for oursearch for a business combination. We intend to use the excess working capital(approximately $530,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums(approximately $150,000) and to pay interest on the loans (of which $75,000 wasfunded on May 28, 2005, $15,000 was funded on July 6, 2006, $15,000 was fundedon November 6, 2006, $6,500 was funded on March 1, 2007 and $29,000 was fundedon June 25, 2007) from InterAmerican Advisors, LLC (which accrue interest at anannual rate of 6% and was $10,436 as of the balance sheet date), with thebalance of $361,564 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating businesscombinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of anyout-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection withactivities on our behalf as described below. We expect that due diligence ofprospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officersand directors and may include engaging market research firms and/or third partyconsultants. Our officers and directors will not receive any compensation fortheir due diligence of prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursedfor any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connectionwith such due diligence activities. We believe that the excess working capitalwill be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs basedon managementâ€™s judgment and prior experience in concluding acquisitions ofmiddle market companies as further described in the â€˜â€˜Managementâ€™â€™ sectionbelow. However, management has no experience closing an acquisition for anyblank check company and there can be no assurance that the working capitalavailable to us will be sufficient to meet all of our expenses incurred whileseeking, evaluating and closing an initial business combination.It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working capitalto pay finders fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation, make adeposit, a down payment, a lock-up payment or fund a â€˜â€˜no-shopâ€™â€™ provision withrespect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not haveany current intention to do so. If we did, the amount that would be used as adown payment or lock-up payment would be determined based on the terms of thespecific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time.In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether asa result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise),we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital available outside of thetrust account to conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to findinganother suitable business combination without securing additional financing.Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we would most likelyfail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and would beforced to liquidate.To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trustaccount as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to financethe operations of the target business.InterAmerican Advisors, LLC has advanced to us a total of $140,500 (of which$75,000 was funded on May 28, 2005, $15,000 was funded on July 6, 2006, $15,000was funded on November 6, 2006, $6,500 was funded on March 1, 2007 and $29,000was funded on June 25, 2007) which has been used to pay a portion of theexpenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal and au"

Approximately $715,000 of theoutstanding indebtedness under our Loan Agreement was incurred during the yearended December 31, 2006, and this portion of the indebtedness was used forcapital equipment purchases.    Although we are not currently pursuing any particular acquisition orin-licensing transaction, we expect to look for those opportunities that webelieve are a strategic fit with our business, including opportunities thatcould improve our cost structure, and complement our existing specializeddiagnostic services, including technologies that could lead to new diagnosticservices we believe to be valuable to our community-based hem/onc customers. Tothe degree that we pursue any of these transactions, the amount of proceeds thatwe have available for working capital and general corporate purposes maydecrease.    Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to investthese funds in short-term government agency securities. The amounts and timingof our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the rateat which we hire additional personnel and expand our infrastructure and thequality of opportunities we see for collaborations, acquisitions or in-licenses.We therefore cannot estimate with certainty the amount of net proceeds to beused individually or in the aggregate for all of the purposes described above."

                          (1)   Approximately $100,000 of the offering expenses have been or will be paid         from loans we have received or will receive from Mr. Green. These loans will      be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.                (2)   No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the      insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts        are reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of      the offering. An additional $2,880,000, all of which will be deposited in         trust following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the               underwriters only if and when we consummate a business combination.            (3)   Includes $2,880,000 held in trust for the benefit of the underwriters in the      event we consummate a business combination.                                    (4)   The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $100,000         even if the over-allotment option is exercised. In addition, $1,500,000 of        interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be           available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of      presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount        of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.         (5)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these        items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may         incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in         connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based          upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not              anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than                 fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which            fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific        category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our existingstockholders have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregatepurchase price of $2,100,000) from us. These purchases will take place in aprivate placement that will occur simultaneously with the consummation of thisoffering. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to thepurchase of the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from thispurchase will be placed in the trust account described below. $69,140,000, or $79,616,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $2,100,000 we will receive from thesale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at HSBC BankUSA, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York,New York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwritingdiscounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. Theunderwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until weconsummate a business combination and have waived their right to receive suchpayment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete a businesscombination. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United Statesâ€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money marketfunds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under theInvestment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investmentcompany under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest incomethat may be released to us of (i) up to $1,500,000 to fund expenses related toinvestigating and selecting a target business and our other working capitalrequirements and (ii) any additional amounts we may need to pay our income orother tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust accountuntil the earlier of the completion of a business combination or ourliquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as considerationto pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a businesscombination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the targetbusiness may be used to finance operations of the target business. The payment to our management stockholders, an affiliate of our managementstockholders or third parties of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for certainadministrative, technology and secretarial services, as well as the use ofcertain limited office space. This arrangement is being agreed to for ourbenefit and is not intended to provide our management stockholders compensationin lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services inthe New York City metropolitan area identified by our management stockholders,that the fee charged is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from anunaffiliated person. Although we have not yet identified office space, we mayrent office space in a facility shared with other companies. This arrangementwill terminate upon completion of a business combination or the distribution ofthe trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per monthfee, no compensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s, consulting or othersimilar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors,stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services theyrender in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination(regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individualswill receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them inconnection with activities on our behalf, such as searching for and identifyingpotential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitabletarget businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from theoffices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examinetheir operations or meet with their representatives or owners. Reimbursement forsuch expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust andcurrently allocated to â€œLegal, accounting and other third-party expensesattendant to the search for target businesses and to the due diligenceinvestigation, structuring and negotiation of a business combination,â€ù â€œDuediligence of prospective target businesses by our officers, directors andexisting stockholdersâ€ù and â€œWorking capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&Oinsurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation obligations and reserves.â€ùSince the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to thosepersons after a business combination. Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the netproceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for abusiness combination will be $100,000. In addition, interest earned on the fundsheld in the trust account, up to $1,500,000, may be released to us to fund ourworking capital requirements. We will also be entitled to have interest earnedon the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any tax obligationsthat we may owe. We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately$450,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately$127,500), with the balance of $322,500 being held in reserve in the event duediligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiatingbusiness combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of anyout-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection withactivities on our behalf. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover theforegoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the fundsnot being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from â€œshoppingâ€ù around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. Ifwe entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would be determined based on the termsof the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searchingfor, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses. The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the eventthat our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of suchproceeds within the above described categories. We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business andto pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock isused in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, theproceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a businesscombination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with anyother net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance theoperations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in avariety of ways including continuing or expanding the target businessâ€™operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research anddevelopment of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repayany operating expenses or findersâ€™ fees which we had incurred prior to thecompletion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside ofthe trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses. Further, we may seekto acquire a target business with a fair market value significantly in excess of80% of our net assets held in the trust account. In order to do so, we may seekto raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equitysecurities, and we may effect a business combination using the proceeds of suchoffering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. There are noprohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans that wouldallow us to acquire a company with a fair market value in an amount greater than80% of the net assets held in the trust account at the time of the acquisition.At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with anythird party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale ofsecurities or otherwise. Our 30% conversion threshold is 20% in most similarblank check companies.  To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will paythe costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.If such funds are insufficient, our existing stockholders have agreed to advanceus the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to beno more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment ofsuch expenses. Theodore S. Green, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, has advanced tous $100,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offeringreferenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee,the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, and aportion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan bears interest at therate of 5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, and will be payable on theearlier of May 21, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will berepaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment ofoffering expenses. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from thetrust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a businesscombination is not consummated during that time. A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) onlyin the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts suchshares into cash in connection with a business combination which the publicstockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstanceswill a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in thetrust account. Upon the consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters willbe entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust accountattributable to the underwritersâ€™ discounts and commissions held in the trustaccount."

This amountincludes the net proceeds of this offering and a portion of the proceeds fromthe private placement, and $4,950,000 ($6,187,500 if the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwritingcompensation to be paid to Maxim Group LLC if and only if, a businesscombination is consummated. The proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account until theearlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidation of thetrust account in the event we do not consummate a business combination. Theproceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of Maxim Group LLCâ€™s deferredunderwriting compensation plus up to $420,000 of interest earned thereon held inthe trust account) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a targetbusiness with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amountsnot paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business (other thanamounts paid for findersâ€™ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees orcosts incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made inconnection with the business combination) may be used to finance operations ofthe target business.We expect to allocate the $3,000,000 funds identified for working capital asfollows:                                                                                       Allocation of Working Capital(1)                                           Amount                                                                           Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the structuring and                negotiation of a business combination                                    $   600,000  Due diligence, identification and research of prospective target                     business and reimbursement of out of pocket due diligence expenses to                management                                                                   700,000  Working capital and reserves (including findersâ€™ fees, consulting fees               or other similar compensation, potential deposits, down payments,                    franchise taxes (if any), funding of a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with                      respect to a particular business combination and dissolution                         obligations and reserves, if necessary(2))                                   670,000  Expenses incurred in connection with quarterly interest distributions                to our public stockholders and related administrative and professional               costs in connection with election to be classified as a partnership                  for United States Federal income tax purposes(3)                             630,000  Payment for office space and administrative and support services                     ($7,500 per month for up to 2 years)                                         180,000  Legal and accounting fees relating to SEC reporting obligations               70,000  Directorsâ€™ and Officersâ€™ Liability Insurance                                 150,000                                                                                        Total                                                                    $ 3,000,000                                                                                         (1)   The allocation below is an estimate and may not prove to be accurate.          (2)   We currently estimate that we would require approximately $15,000 to              implement our plan of dissolution in the event we do not consummate a             business combination.                                                          (3)   Consists of two years of fees in connection with the quarterly payment of         interest earned on the trust account (approximately $10,000 to $15,000            annually) and administrative costs associated with our election to be             treated as a partnership for United States Federal income tax purposes            (approximately $250,000 to $300,000 annually).                               We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performedby some or all of our officers and directors, but is expected to includeengaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers anddirectors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence ofprospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocketexpenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such duediligence activities. It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to make adeposit, down payment or fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respect to a particularproposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention todo so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds(whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment orotherwise), if such payment was large enough and we had already used up thefunds available for due diligence and related expenses in connection with theaborted transaction, we could be left with insufficient funds to continuesearching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential targetbusinesses. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we wouldmost likely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time andwould be forced to liquidate. It is possible that our existing shareholderscould advance us the additional required funds, thereby increasing the amount ofexcess out-of-pocket expenses to be reimbursed following a business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trustaccount as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to financethe operations of the target business. We believe that the amount allocated to working capital will be sufficient tocover the costs related to the acquisition of a target business andreimbursement costs, even if the costs of due diligence, legal, accounting andother expenses of structuring and negotiating a business combination exceed ourestimates. As of the consummation of this offering, our executive officers have advanced tous a total of $450,986, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of thisoffering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASDregistration fee, AMEX Listing fees, legal fees and expenses and an advance onMaximâ€™s non accountable expense allowance. Such loan will be payable with 4.0%annual interest on the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid out ofthe proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.The funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United Statesâ€œgovernment securities,â€ù defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the UnitedStates having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meetingcertain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Actof 1940, as amended. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of thisoffering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investmentcompany within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that abusiness combination is not consummated during that time. No compensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s and consulting fees) will bepaid to any of our existing shareholders, officers or directors, or any of theiraffiliates, from us or from any other party for any services rendered to usprior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination. Ourexisting shareholders, officers and directors, will only be entitled to receivereimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection withactivities on our behalf. To the extent that such out-of-pocket expenses exceedthe available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such out-of-pocketexpenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a businesscombination, in which event this reimbursement obligation would in alllikelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business. Since the role ofpresent management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no abilityto determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after abusiness combination. Although we are formed as a corporation under the laws of the Republic of theMarshall Islands, for United States federal income tax purposes, we elected tobe classified as a partnership, and not as a corporation. Because we haveelected to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their distributiveshares of our taxable income or gain (whether or not distributed). As a means topass down to our public shareholders the benefit of the interest that is earnedon the trust account, our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporationrequires that we distribute the interest earned on the trust account to ourpublic shareholders, and that we make quarterly distributions (which areintended to be at least equal to any such tax liability) in US dollars ofinterest income earned on the trust account (less any taxes payable by us andexclusive of (i) up to $420,000 of interest earned on Maxim Group LLCâ€™s deferredunderwriting compensation held in the trust account and (ii) up to an aggregateof $742,500 of interest income on the proceeds in the trust account that we maydraw in the event the over-allotment option is exercised in full) on a pro-ratabasis to our public shareholders until the earlier of the consummation of abusiness combination or our liquidation. This is atypical of other offerings ofthis type, where a significant portion, if not all, of the interest earned onthe trust account pending the consummation of a business combination is added tothe funds held in the trust account and either disbursed as payment for part ofthe purchase price for a business combination, or maintained for working capitalpurposes to be used following the consummation of a business combination. Pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,distributions will be made on a quarterly basis within 15 days of the end of theprior quarter to shareholders of record on a date to be determined by our Boardof Directors which we expect to be on or shortly following the fifth businessday following the end of the prior quarter. The first distribution will be made following the end of the December 31, 2007quarter and will include interest which accrues during the period commencing onthe close of the offering through December 31, 2007. We expect that within threebusiness days following the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing with thequarter ending December 31, 2007), our accounting consultants will havesufficient opportunity to review our monthly investment account statements andto calculate the amount to be distributed to each of our public shareholders,our board of directors will meet to officially fix the record date with respectto the distribution of dividends earned during the immediately preceding quarter(or, in the case of the first distribution, the period commencing on the closingof the offering through December 31, 2007) and we will announce the record dateand distribution to the public by means of a press release and/or a CurrentReport on Form 8-K. We expect the record date to be on or shortly following thefifth business day following the end of the prior quarter and, as provided inour Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, to make thedistributions to record date public shareholders within 15 days of the end ofthe prior quarter, which in any event will be in accordance with our bylaws andthe Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act, which requires that a recorddate not be more than sixty days prior to the date we make such distribution. Inaccordance with our instructions, our transfer agent, Continental StockTransfer & Trust Company, will identify the shareholders of record on the designated record date and act as paying agent in delivering quarterly interest payments tothe then shareholders of record. We expect the costs incurred in connection with theabove-described quarterly interest distributions to be in the range of $10,000to $15,000 per year. Such expenses will be paid from funds available to usoutside the trust account for working capital purposes. Our board of directorswill make a quarterly distribution of all interest income available to bedistributed (less taxes payable and exclusive of (i) up to $420,000 of interestearned on Maxim Group LLCâ€™s deferred underwriting compensation and (ii) up to anaggregate of $742,500, as described above) with no discretion to reduce ormodify the distributions. Our shareholders prior to this offering have agreed towaive any rights to such distributions. In the event of the exercise of theover-allotment option, the first interest distribution to our publicshareholders will be reduced by up to $742,500 (in proportion to the portion ofthe over-allotment option exercised) in the aggregate reflecting interest incomeon the trust account we will be permitted to draw to replace certain of thecosts and expenses associated with the exercise of the over-allotment option,which will be paid from funds outside our trust account on the consummation ofthe over-allotment option. These costs and expenses will be paid from funds heldoutside the trust account because there will not be sufficient gross proceedsfrom exercise of the over-allotment option to cover all attendant costs. This isto ensure that at all times there will be a minimum of $10.00 per unit held inthe trust account. If less than the full over-allotment is exercised, the amountof additional costs and expenses will be calculated on a pro-rata basis. Thecost for the administration of the quarterly distributions will be paid for byus out of our working capital held outside the trust account. Other than the quarterly distribution of interest, as described above, a publicshareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) inthe event of the liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combinationwithin the allotted time, in such case, including interest earned on his, her orits portion of the trust account which has not been previously distributed andnet of taxes payable, subject to any valid claim by our creditors that are notcovered by amounts in the trust account or indemnities provided by our executiveofficers, or (ii) if that public shareholder were to seek to redeem such sharesfor cash in connection with a business combination which the public shareholdervoted against and which we actually consummate, in such case not includinginterest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account. In no othercircumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kindto or in the trust account."

This amountincludes the net proceeds of this offering and a portion of the proceeds fromthe private placement, and $4,950,000 ($6,187,500 if the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwritingcompensation to be paid to Maxim Group LLC if and only if, a businesscombination is consummated. The proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account until theearlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidation of thetrust account in the event we do not consummate a business combination. Theproceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of Maxim Group LLCâ€™s deferredunderwriting compensation plus up to $420,000 of interest earned thereon held inthe trust account) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a targetbusiness with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amountsnot paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business (other thanamounts paid for findersâ€™ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees orcosts incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made inconnection with the business combination) may be used to finance operations ofthe target business.We expect to allocate the $3,000,000 funds identified for working capital asfollows:                                                                                       Allocation of Working Capital(1)                                           Amount                                                                           Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the structuring and                negotiation of a business combination                                    $   600,000  Due diligence, identification and research of prospective target                     business and reimbursement of out of pocket due diligence expenses to                management                                                                   700,000  Working capital and reserves (including findersâ€™ fees, consulting fees               or other similar compensation, potential deposits, down payments,                    franchise taxes (if any), funding of a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with                      respect to a particular business combination and dissolution                         obligations and reserves, if necessary(2))                                   670,000  Expenses incurred in connection with quarterly interest distributions                to our public stockholders and related administrative and professional               costs in connection with election to be classified as a partnership                  for United States Federal income tax purposes(3)                             630,000  Payment for office space and administrative and support services                     ($7,500 per month for up to 2 years)                                         180,000  Legal and accounting fees relating to SEC reporting obligations               70,000  Directorsâ€™ and Officersâ€™ Liability Insurance                                 150,000                                                                                        Total                                                                    $ 3,000,000                                                                                         (1)   The allocation below is an estimate and may not prove to be accurate.          (2)   We currently estimate that we would require approximately $15,000 to              implement our plan of dissolution in the event we do not consummate a             business combination.                                                          (3)   Consists of two years of fees in connection with the quarterly payment of         interest earned on the trust account (approximately $10,000 to $15,000            annually) and administrative costs associated with our election to be             treated as a partnership for United States Federal income tax purposes            (approximately $250,000 to $300,000 annually).                               We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performedby some or all of our officers and directors, but is expected to includeengaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers anddirectors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence ofprospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocketexpenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such duediligence activities. It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to make adeposit, down payment or fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respect to a particularproposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention todo so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds(whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment orotherwise), if such payment was large enough and we had already used up thefunds available for due diligence and related expenses in connection with theaborted transaction, we could be left with insufficient funds to continuesearching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential targetbusinesses. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we wouldmost likely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time andwould be forced to liquidate. It is possible that our existing shareholderscould advance us the additional required funds, thereby increasing the amount ofexcess out-of-pocket expenses to be reimbursed following a business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trustaccount as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to financethe operations of the target business. We believe that the amount allocated to working capital will be sufficient tocover the costs related to the acquisition of a target business andreimbursement costs, even if the costs of due diligence, legal, accounting andother expenses of structuring and negotiating a business combination exceed ourestimates. As of the consummation of this offering, our executive officers have advanced tous a total of $450,986, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of thisoffering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASDregistration fee, AMEX Listing fees, legal fees and expenses and an advance onMaximâ€™s non accountable expense allowance. Such loan will be payable with 4.0%annual interest on the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid out ofthe proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.The funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United Statesâ€œgovernment securities,â€ù defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the UnitedStates having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meetingcertain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Actof 1940, as amended. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of thisoffering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investmentcompany within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that abusiness combination is not consummated during that time. No compensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s and consulting fees) will bepaid to any of our existing shareholders, officers or directors, or any of theiraffiliates, from us or from any other party for any services rendered to usprior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination. Ourexisting shareholders, officers and directors, will only be entitled to receivereimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection withactivities on our behalf. To the extent that such out-of-pocket expenses exceedthe available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such out-of-pocketexpenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a businesscombination, in which event this reimbursement obligation would in alllikelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business. Since the role ofpresent management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no abilityto determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after abusiness combination. Although we are formed as a corporation under the laws of the Republic of theMarshall Islands, for United States federal income tax purposes, we elected tobe classified as a partnership, and not as a corporation. Because we haveelected to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their distributiveshares of our taxable income or gain (whether or not distributed). As a means topass down to our public shareholders the benefit of the interest that is earnedon the trust account, our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporationrequires that we distribute the interest earned on the trust account to ourpublic shareholders, and that we make quarterly distributions (which areintended to be at least equal to any such tax liability) in US dollars ofinterest income earned on the trust account (less any taxes payable by us andexclusive of (i) up to $420,000 of interest earned on Maxim Group LLCâ€™s deferredunderwriting compensation held in the trust account and (ii) up to an aggregateof $742,500 of interest income on the proceeds in the trust account that we maydraw in the event the over-allotment option is exercised in full) on a pro-ratabasis to our public shareholders until the earlier of the consummation of abusiness combination or our liquidation. This is atypical of other offerings ofthis type, where a significant portion, if not all, of the interest earned onthe trust account pending the consummation of a business combination is added tothe funds held in the trust account and either disbursed as payment for part ofthe purchase price for a business combination, or maintained for working capitalpurposes to be used following the consummation of a business combination. Pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,distributions will be made on a quarterly basis within 15 days of the end of theprior quarter to shareholders of record on a date to be determined by our Boardof Directors which we expect to be on or shortly following the fifth businessday following the end of the prior quarter. The first distribution will be made following the end of the December 31, 2007quarter and will include interest which accrues during the period commencing onthe close of the offering through December 31, 2007. We expect that within threebusiness days following the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing with thequarter ending December 31, 2007), our accounting consultants will havesufficient opportunity to review our monthly investment account statements andto calculate the amount to be distributed to each of our public shareholders,our board of directors will meet to officially fix the record date with respectto the distribution of dividends earned during the immediately preceding quarter(or, in the case of the first distribution, the period commencing on the closingof the offering through December 31, 2007) and we will announce the record dateand distribution to the public by means of a press release and/or a CurrentReport on Form 8-K. We expect the record date to be on or shortly following thefifth business day following the end of the prior quarter and, as provided inour Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, to make thedistributions to record date public shareholders within 15 days of the end ofthe prior quarter, which in any event will be in accordance with our bylaws andthe Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act, which requires that a recorddate not be more than sixty days prior to the date we make such distribution. Inaccordance with our instructions, our transfer agent, Continental StockTransfer & Trust Company, will identify the shareholders of record on the designated record date and act as paying agent in delivering quarterly interest payments tothe then shareholders of record. We expect the costs incurred in connection with theabove-described quarterly interest distributions to be in the range of $10,000to $15,000 per year. Such expenses will be paid from funds available to usoutside the trust account for working capital purposes. Our board of directorswill make a quarterly distribution of all interest income available to bedistributed (less taxes payable and exclusive of (i) up to $420,000 of interestearned on Maxim Group LLCâ€™s deferred underwriting compensation and (ii) up to anaggregate of $742,500, as described above) with no discretion to reduce ormodify the distributions. Our shareholders prior to this offering have agreed towaive any rights to such distributions. In the event of the exercise of theover-allotment option, the first interest distribution to our publicshareholders will be reduced by up to $742,500 (in proportion to the portion ofthe over-allotment option exercised) in the aggregate reflecting interest incomeon the trust account we will be permitted to draw to replace certain of thecosts and expenses associated with the exercise of the over-allotment option,which will be paid from funds outside our trust account on the consummation ofthe over-allotment option. These costs and expenses will be paid from funds heldoutside the trust account because there will not be sufficient gross proceedsfrom exercise of the over-allotment option to cover all attendant costs. This isto ensure that at all times there will be a minimum of $10.00 per unit held inthe trust account. If less than the full over-allotment is exercised, the amountof additional costs and expenses will be calculated on a pro-rata basis. Thecost for the administration of the quarterly distributions will be paid for byus out of our working capital held outside the trust account. Other than the quarterly distribution of interest, as described above, a publicshareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) inthe event of the liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combinationwithin the allotted time, in such case, including interest earned on his, her orits portion of the trust account which has not been previously distributed andnet of taxes payable, subject to any valid claim by our creditors that are notcovered by amounts in the trust account or indemnities provided by our executiveofficers, or (ii) if that public shareholder were to seek to redeem such sharesfor cash in connection with a business combination which the public shareholdervoted against and which we actually consummate, in such case not includinginterest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account. In no othercircumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kindto or in the trust account."

This amountincludes the net proceeds of this offering and a portion of the proceeds fromthe private placement, and $4,950,000 ($6,187,500 if the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwritingcompensation to be paid to Maxim Group LLC if and only if, a businesscombination is consummated. The proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account until theearlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidation of thetrust account in the event we do not consummate a business combination. Theproceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of Maxim Group LLCâ€™s deferredunderwriting compensation plus up to $420,000 of interest earned thereon held inthe trust account) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a targetbusiness with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amountsnot paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business (other thanamounts paid for findersâ€™ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees orcosts incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made inconnection with the business combination) may be used to finance operations ofthe target business.We expect to allocate the $3,000,000 funds identified for working capital asfollows:                                                                                       Allocation of Working Capital(1)                                           Amount                                                                           Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the structuring and                negotiation of a business combination                                    $   600,000  Due diligence, identification and research of prospective target                     business and reimbursement of out of pocket due diligence expenses to                management                                                                   700,000  Working capital and reserves (including findersâ€™ fees, consulting fees               or other similar compensation, potential deposits, down payments,                    franchise taxes (if any), funding of a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with                      respect to a particular business combination and dissolution                         obligations and reserves, if necessary(2))                                   670,000  Expenses incurred in connection with quarterly interest distributions                to our public stockholders and related administrative and professional               costs in connection with election to be classified as a partnership                  for United States Federal income tax purposes(3)                             630,000  Payment for office space and administrative and support services                     ($7,500 per month for up to 2 years)                                         180,000  Legal and accounting fees relating to SEC reporting obligations               70,000  Directorsâ€™ and Officersâ€™ Liability Insurance                                 150,000                                                                                        Total                                                                    $ 3,000,000                                                                                         (1)   The allocation below is an estimate and may not prove to be accurate.          (2)   We currently estimate that we would require approximately $15,000 to              implement our plan of dissolution in the event we do not consummate a             business combination.                                                          (3)   Consists of two years of fees in connection with the quarterly payment of         interest earned on the trust account (approximately $10,000 to $15,000            annually) and administrative costs associated with our election to be             treated as a partnership for United States Federal income tax purposes            (approximately $250,000 to $300,000 annually).                               We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performedby some or all of our officers and directors, but is expected to includeengaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers anddirectors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence ofprospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocketexpenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such duediligence activities. It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to make adeposit, down payment or fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respect to a particularproposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention todo so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds(whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment orotherwise), if such payment was large enough and we had already used up thefunds available for due diligence and related expenses in connection with theaborted transaction, we could be left with insufficient funds to continuesearching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential targetbusinesses. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we wouldmost likely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time andwould be forced to liquidate. It is possible that our existing shareholderscould advance us the additional required funds, thereby increasing the amount ofexcess out-of-pocket expenses to be reimbursed following a business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trustaccount as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to financethe operations of the target business. We believe that the amount allocated to working capital will be sufficient tocover the costs related to the acquisition of a target business andreimbursement costs, even if the costs of due diligence, legal, accounting andother expenses of structuring and negotiating a business combination exceed ourestimates. As of the consummation of this offering, our executive officers have advanced tous a total of $450,986, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of thisoffering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASDregistration fee, AMEX Listing fees, legal fees and expenses and an advance onMaximâ€™s non accountable expense allowance. Such loan will be payable with 4.0%annual interest on the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid out ofthe proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.The funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United Statesâ€œgovernment securities,â€ù defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the UnitedStates having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meetingcertain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Actof 1940, as amended. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of thisoffering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investmentcompany within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that abusiness combination is not consummated during that time. No compensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s and consulting fees) will bepaid to any of our existing shareholders, officers or directors, or any of theiraffiliates, from us or from any other party for any services rendered to usprior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination. Ourexisting shareholders, officers and directors, will only be entitled to receivereimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection withactivities on our behalf. To the extent that such out-of-pocket expenses exceedthe available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such out-of-pocketexpenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a businesscombination, in which event this reimbursement obligation would in alllikelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business. Since the role ofpresent management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no abilityto determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after abusiness combination. Although we are formed as a corporation under the laws of the Republic of theMarshall Islands, for United States federal income tax purposes, we elected tobe classified as a partnership, and not as a corporation. Because we haveelected to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their distributiveshares of our taxable income or gain (whether or not distributed). As a means topass down to our public shareholders the benefit of the interest that is earnedon the trust account, our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporationrequires that we distribute the interest earned on the trust account to ourpublic shareholders, and that we make quarterly distributions (which areintended to be at least equal to any such tax liability) in US dollars ofinterest income earned on the trust account (less any taxes payable by us andexclusive of (i) up to $420,000 of interest earned on Maxim Group LLCâ€™s deferredunderwriting compensation held in the trust account and (ii) up to an aggregateof $742,500 of interest income on the proceeds in the trust account that we maydraw in the event the over-allotment option is exercised in full) on a pro-ratabasis to our public shareholders until the earlier of the consummation of abusiness combination or our liquidation. This is atypical of other offerings ofthis type, where a significant portion, if not all, of the interest earned onthe trust account pending the consummation of a business combination is added tothe funds held in the trust account and either disbursed as payment for part ofthe purchase price for a business combination, or maintained for working capitalpurposes to be used following the consummation of a business combination. Pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,distributions will be made on a quarterly basis within 15 days of the end of theprior quarter to shareholders of record on a date to be determined by our Boardof Directors which we expect to be on or shortly following the fifth businessday following the end of the prior quarter. The first distribution will be made following the end of the December 31, 2007quarter and will include interest which accrues during the period commencing onthe close of the offering through December 31, 2007. We expect that within threebusiness days following the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing with thequarter ending December 31, 2007), our accounting consultants will havesufficient opportunity to review our monthly investment account statements andto calculate the amount to be distributed to each of our public shareholders,our board of directors will meet to officially fix the record date with respectto the distribution of dividends earned during the immediately preceding quarter(or, in the case of the first distribution, the period commencing on the closingof the offering through December 31, 2007) and we will announce the record dateand distribution to the public by means of a press release and/or a CurrentReport on Form 8-K. We expect the record date to be on or shortly following thefifth business day following the end of the prior quarter and, as provided inour Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, to make thedistributions to record date public shareholders within 15 days of the end ofthe prior quarter, which in any event will be in accordance with our bylaws andthe Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act, which requires that a recorddate not be more than sixty days prior to the date we make such distribution. Inaccordance with our instructions, our transfer agent, Continental StockTransfer & Trust Company, will identify the shareholders of record on the designated record date and act as paying agent in delivering quarterly interest payments tothe then shareholders of record. We expect the costs incurred in connection with theabove-described quarterly interest distributions to be in the range of $10,000to $15,000 per year. Such expenses will be paid from funds available to usoutside the trust account for working capital purposes. Our board of directorswill make a quarterly distribution of all interest income available to bedistributed (less taxes payable and exclusive of (i) up to $420,000 of interestearned on Maxim Group LLCâ€™s deferred underwriting compensation and (ii) up to anaggregate of $742,500, as described above) with no discretion to reduce ormodify the distributions. Our shareholders prior to this offering have agreed towaive any rights to such distributions. In the event of the exercise of theover-allotment option, the first interest distribution to our publicshareholders will be reduced by up to $742,500 (in proportion to the portion ofthe over-allotment option exercised) in the aggregate reflecting interest incomeon the trust account we will be permitted to draw to replace certain of thecosts and expenses associated with the exercise of the over-allotment option,which will be paid from funds outside our trust account on the consummation ofthe over-allotment option. These costs and expenses will be paid from funds heldoutside the trust account because there will not be sufficient gross proceedsfrom exercise of the over-allotment option to cover all attendant costs. This isto ensure that at all times there will be a minimum of $10.00 per unit held inthe trust account. If less than the full over-allotment is exercised, the amountof additional costs and expenses will be calculated on a pro-rata basis. Thecost for the administration of the quarterly distributions will be paid for byus out of our working capital held outside the trust account. Other than the quarterly distribution of interest, as described above, a publicshareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) inthe event of the liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combinationwithin the allotted time, in such case, including interest earned on his, her orits portion of the trust account which has not been previously distributed andnet of taxes payable, subject to any valid claim by our creditors that are notcovered by amounts in the trust account or indemnities provided by our executiveofficers, or (ii) if that public shareholder were to seek to redeem such sharesfor cash in connection with a business combination which the public shareholdervoted against and which we actually consummate, in such case not includinginterest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account. In no othercircumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kindto or in the trust account."

From time to time, in theordinary course of business, we expect to evaluate potential acquisitions of orinvestments in these businesses, services or technologies and strategicrelationships.Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of thisoffering as described above, there may be circumstances where for sound businessreasons, a reallocation of funds may be necessary. We may re-allocate the netproceeds from time to time depending upon the ultimate amount of net proceedsraised and upon changes in business conditions prevalent at the time. The timingand amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, includingthe successful early clinical development of our lead product candidates, cashflows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business. Pending theseuses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering primarily inshort-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.We will require additional funds to complete the pre-surgical nasal preparationand urinary tract programs to an NDA (New Drug Application) filing withregulatory authorities and for the initiation of at least two additionalprograms. We estimate that the clinical development of each indication will costbetween $15 million and $30 million and will take between three and five years."

$124,352 of the offering expenses, including the SEC                registration fee, the FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the         American Stock Exchange filing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting      fees, have been or will be paid from the funds we received from our existing      stockholders described below. These funds will be repaid out of the interest      income earned on the trust account.                                           (2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the      founder warrants. $3,200,000, or $3,680,000 if the over-allotment option is       exercised in full (in each case, less $0.32 for each share of our common          stock that our public stockholders elect to convert in connection with the        consummation of our initial business combination), of the underwriting            discounts and commissions will be deposited in the trust account following        the consummation of the offering and is payable to the underwriters only if       and when we consummate a business combination. In the event that a business       combination is not consummated within the required time period, that amount       will be included in the liquidating distribution to our public stockholders       on a pro rata basis.                                                          (3) None of the proceeds from this offering will be held outside of the trust         account; $1,000,000 of interest income earned (net of taxes) on the amounts       held in the trust account will be available to us to pay for our working          capital requirements. In addition, $150,000 of interest income earned (net        of taxes) on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us        to repay the loan made to us by Secure America Acquisition Holdings, LLC.         For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as         the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the        offering.                                                                     (4) The miscellaneous fees and expenses may include, without limitation,              findersâ€™ fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation, potential           deposits, down payments or funding of a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respect to       a particular business combination), D&O insurance, trusteeâ€™s fees in the          amount of a $1,000 initial acceptance fee and $3,000 in annual fees, and          dissolution obligations and reserves, if any.                               We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire, or acquirecontrol of, one or more domestic or international operating businesses in thehomeland security industry, but not businesses that design, build or maintainmission-critical facilities.Of the proceeds from this offering and the private placement, $79,200,000, or$90,840,000, if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full, ofwhich $3,200,000 (or $3,680,000, if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option isexercised in full) is attributable to the deferred underwritersâ€™ discounts andcommissions, will be placed in a trust account at SunTrust Bank, maintained byContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. The funds held inthe trust account will be invested only in United States â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ùwithin the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certainconditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,in order to comply with certain exemptions under the Investment Company Act.Except with respect to interest income (net of taxes) that may be released to usof (i) up to $1,000,000 to fund expenses related to investigating and selectinga target business and our other working capital requirements, (ii) $150,000 forthe repayment of the loan made to us by Secure America Acquisition Holdings, LLCand (iii) any additional amounts we may need to pay our income tax obligations,the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier ofthe completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The amounts held inthe trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a targetbusiness with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid asconsideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to financeoperations of the target business.We have agreed to pay Homeland Security Capital Corporation a monthly fee of$7,500 for general and administrative services, including office space,utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement was agreed to by HomelandSecurity Capital Corporation, an affiliate of Mr. McMillen, for our benefit andis not intended to provide Mr. McMillen compensation in lieu of a salary. Webelieve that, based on rents and fees for similar services in the Washington,D.C. metropolitan area, the fee charged by Homeland Security Capital Corporationis at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated thirdparty. Upon completion of a business combination or our liquidation, we will nolonger be required to pay these monthly fees. Other than the $7,500 per monthadministrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s, consultingor other similar fees) will be paid to any of our officers, directors, existingstockholders or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services theyrender in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination(regardless of the form of such transaction). However, these persons willreceive reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connectionwith activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and businesscombinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similarlocations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.None of the proceeds from this offering will initially be available to us out ofthe trust account. Interest earned (net of taxes) on the funds held in the trustaccount, up to $1,000,000 may be released to us to fund our working capitalrequirements. These funds will be used by us for director and officer liabilityinsurance premiums, due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses ofstructuring and negotiating business combinations, as well as for reimbursementof any out-of-pocket expenses incurred. We will also be entitled to haveinterest earned (net of taxes) on the funds held in the trust account releasedto us to pay any income tax obligations that we may owe. We believe these fundswill be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. Inaddition, $150,000 of interest income earned (net of taxes) on the amounts heldin the trust account may be released to us to repay the loan made to us bySecure America Acquisition Holdings, LLC. We could use a portion of the fundsreleased to us from the trust account to pay fees to consultants to assist uswith our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund aâ€œno-shopâ€ù provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep targetbusinesses from â€œshoppingâ€ù around for transactions with other companies on termsmore favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposedbusiness combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. Ifwe entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receiveexclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a downpayment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would be determined based on the termsof the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds atthe time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach orotherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searchingfor, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.The allocation of the interest earned on the funds held in the trust accountavailable to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of thesefunds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we mayreallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories.We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire, or acquire controlof, a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extentthat our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect abusiness combination, the amounts held in the trust account which are not usedto consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined companyand will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as workingcapital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capitalfunds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding thetarget businessâ€™ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing,research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also beused to repay any operating expenses or findersâ€™ fees which we had incurredprior to the completion of our business combination if the funds available to usoutside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will paythe costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.If such funds are insufficient, Messrs. McMillen and Weiss have agreed toadvance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currentlyanticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not toseek or accept repayment of such expenses.As of the date of this prospectus, Secure America Acquisition Holdings, LLC hasadvanced to us $150,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of thisoffering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, theFINRA registration fee, American Stock Exchange application fee and legal andaccounting fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on theearlier of June 4, 2008 or the consummation of a business combination. The loanwill be repaid out of the interest income earned (net of taxes) on the amountsheld in the trust account.The net proceeds of this offering which are not held in the trust account andnot immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested onlyin United States â€œgovernment securities,â€ù defined as any Treasury Bills issuedby the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money marketfunds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under theInvestment Company Act so that we are not deemed to be an investment companyunder the Investment Company Act.We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds from the amounts that may be released to us from the trustaccount to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business combinationis not consummated during that time.A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, netof taxes payable, which taxes, if any, shall be paid from the trust account)only in the event of our dissolution and liquidation upon our failure tocomplete a business combination within the allotted time or if that publicstockholder were to seek to convert such shares to cash by exercising conversionrights in connection with a business combination which the public stockholdervoted against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will apublic stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trustaccount.Upon the consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters willbe entitled to receive the portion of the amounts held in the trust accountattributable to the deferred underwritersâ€™ discounts and commissions held in thetrust account (subject to a $0.32 per share reduction for public stockholderswho vote against our initial business combination and exercise their conversionrights)."

These estimates are based upon an initial offering price of $17.50 per ADS.We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:â€    approximately $25 million to acquire an office building in Xiamen;â€    approximately $10 to $20 million for acquisitions of IT service companies,     including approximately $3.4 million in cash and potentially an additional     $2.6 million in cash earn-out payment in connection with the acquisition of    FEnet.

Ourmanagement, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to applythe net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or businessconditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than asdescribed in this prospectus.Pending any use, as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds inshort-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or bank deposits. Theseinvestments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income taxconsequences of your investment in our ADSs. In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we arepermitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRCsubsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to other entitiesonly through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable governmentregistration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to ourPRC subsidiaries or make additional capital contributions to our PRCsubsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. We cannotassure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations orapprovals on a timely basis, if at all. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the sellingshareholders."

expenses, including the SEC registration fee and        NASD filing fee, will be paid from the $250,000 non-interest bearing loan         from our officers and directors, as further described below.                      We intend to repay these loans out of the net proceeds of this offering not       being placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.                      (2)   Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this          offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 4.0%,      or $2,400,000 to be held in trust ($2,760,000 if the underwriters                 over-allotment option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business      transaction.                                                                   (3)   Up to $1,100,000 of interest earned on the funds, net of taxes payable, held      in trust will be used to fund our working capital.                             (4)   Upon the closing of the offering, we will have access to a $500,000 limited       recourse revolving line of credit which will bear interest at the federal         funds target interest rate (4.75% as of September 21, 2007) and will become       due and payable at the consummation of the business combination, or earlier       solely from the $1,100,000 of interest earned on the trust account which is       available for working capital.                                               The amount of $59,900,000, or $68,630,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full, of the net proceeds of this offering and thepurchase of the foundersâ€™ warrants, will be placed in a trust account atJPMorgan Chase maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, astrustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United Statesâ€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù or in money market funds meeting certain conditionsunder Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds willnot be released from our trust account until the earlier of the completion of abusiness combination or the liquidation of our trust account. The proceeds heldin our trust account (exclusive of any taxes and any funds held for the benefitof the underwriters) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a targetbusiness with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amountsnot paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used tofinance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, asdetermined by our board of directors at that time. Because we do not have anyspecific business combination under consideration and have not (nor has anyoneon our behalf) had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to such atransaction, it is impossible at this time to determine specifically how wewould, following a business combination, use any proceeds held in our trustaccount which are not used to consummate such business combination. We have agreed to pay Inter-Atlantic Group, an affiliate of certain of theofficers and directors, up to $7,500 per month for office space, utilities,administrative, technology and secretarial services. This arrangement is beingagreed to for our benefit and is not intended to provide director or officercompensation in lieu of salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similarservices in New York, New York, that such fees are at least as favorable as wecould have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminateupon completion of a business combination or the distribution of our trustaccount to our public stockholders. Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option infull, the net proceeds available to us outside of our trust account for oursearch for a business combination will be approximately $1,600,000, or $100,000in excess of our estimated expenses of $1,500,000. We intend to use the excessworking capital (approximately $540,000) for director and officer liabilityinsurance premiums (approximately $220,000), with the balance of $320,000 beingheld in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expensesof structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates,including for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any of ourexisting stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf (includingpossible payments to unaffiliated third-parties for their performance of duediligence). We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient tocover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to engageconsultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could alsouse a portion of the funds not being placed in trust as a down payment or tofund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respect to a particular proposed businesscombination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If weentered into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receiveexclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a downpayment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would be determined based on the termsof the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds atthe time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breachor otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continuesearching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential targetbusinesses. To the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in our trustaccount and other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance theoperations of the target business. Inter-Atlantic Group has agreed to loan us a total of $250,000, which will beused to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering, such as transfer agentfees, SEC registration fees, NASD registration fees, American Stock Exchangeapplication and listing fees, background investigation expenses, printingexpenses, and legal and accounting fees and expenses. We intend to repay theseloans from the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust. The net proceeds of this offering not held in our trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only inUnited States â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù or in money market funds meeting certainconditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act so thatwe are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.By restricting the investment of the proceeds of this offering to theseinstruments, we intend to avoid being deemed to be an investment company withinthe meaning of the Investment Company Act. The interest income derived frominvestment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray ourgeneral and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliancewith securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,until a business combination is completed. We believe that, upon consummation ofthis offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at leastthe next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummatedduring that time. Our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocketexpenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such asidentifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitablebusiness combinations (including possible payments to unaffiliated third partiesfor their performance of due diligence) and for out-of-pocket expenses incurredin connection with this offering. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paidby us out of the funds not held in trust. To the extent that such out-of-pocketexpenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in our trust account suchout-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate abusiness combination, in which event this reimbursement obligation would in alllikelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business. Since the role ofpresent management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no abilityto determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after abusiness combination. A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from our trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of our trust account,excluding up to $1,100,000 of interest which may be used to fund the Companyâ€™sworking capital, net of taxes payable, which taxes, if any, shall be paid fromour trust account) only in the event of our automatic dissolution and subsequentliquidation of our trust account upon our failure to complete a businesscombination or if that public stockholder were to redeem such shares into cashin connection with a business combination which the public stockholder votedagainst and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will apublic stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in our trustaccount."

We expect to use the netproceeds of this offering to repay $280 million of the term loans under ourCredit Facility, and to repay all indebtedness under our $25 million unsecuredfacility and our $25 million secured facility. We will use the remaining netproceeds to repay indebtedness outstanding under the revolving loan facilityunder our Credit Facility. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase3,000,000 additional shares from us in full, the additional net proceeds to uswould be approximately $53.28 million (and the total net proceeds to us would beapproximately $398.48 million) and we intend to use such additional net proceedsin the manner described above. Any remaining net proceeds would be used forgeneral corporate purposes. Our subsidiary, Coffeyville Resources, LLC, entered into the Credit Facility onDecember 28, 2006. The term loans under the Credit Facility mature onDecember 28, 2013 and the revolving loans under the Credit Facility mature onDecember 28, 2012. The term loans under the Credit Facility bear interest ateither (a) the greater of the prime rate and the federal funds effective rateplus 0.5%, plus 2.25%, or, at the borrowerâ€™s election, (b) LIBOR plus 3.25%,subject, in either case, to adjustment upon achievement of certain ratingsconditions. Borrowings under the revolving loans facility (including revolvingletters of credit) bear interest at either (a) the greater of the prime rate andthe federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, plus 2.25%, or, at the borrowerâ€™selection, (b) LIBOR plus 3.25%, subject, in either case, to adjustment uponachievement of certain ratings conditions. At June 30, 2007, the interest rateon the term loans under the Credit Facility was 8.35%. At June 30, 2007,$773.1 million and $40.0 million (or $20.0 million as of September 30, 2007) wasoutstanding under the term loans and the revolving loans, respectively, underthe Credit Facility. The $775 million in net proceeds from the term loans underthe Credit Facility received in December 2006 were used to repay the term loansand revolving loans under our then existing first lien credit facility, repayall amounts outstanding under our then existing second lien credit facility, payrelated fees and expenses, and pay a dividend to existing members of CoffeyvilleAcquisition LLC in the amount of $250 million. The Credit Facility entered intoin December 2006 amended and restated the then existing first lien creditfacility and second lien credit facility which were originally entered into inJune 2005 and which were utilized at that time in conjunction with theSubsequent Acquisition. Our subsidiary, Coffeyville Resources, LLC, entered into the $25 millionunsecured facility and the $25 million secured facility on August 23, 2007 inorder to provide us with enhanced liquidity following the flood and crude oildischarge. On the $25 million unsecured facility, interest is payable in cash,at our option, at the base rate plus 1.00% or at the reserve adjusted eurodollarrate plus 2.00%. As of September 30, 2007, $25 million was outstanding underthis facility. On the $25 million secured facility, interest is payable in cash,at our option, at the base rate plus 1.00% or at the reserve adjusted eurodollarrate plus 2.00%. As of September 30, 2007, $25 million was outstanding underthis facility. The maturity of each of these facilities is January 31, 2008,provided that if there has been an initial public offering on or prior toJanuary 31, 2008, the maturity will be automatically extended to August 23,2008. Under the terms of our Credit Facility, this offering will be deemed aâ€œQualified IPO.â€ù Because this offering is a Qualified IPO, the interest marginon LIBOR loans may in the future decrease from 3.25% to 2.75% (if we have creditratings of B2/B) or 2.50% (if we have credit ratings of B1/B+). Interest on baserate loans will similarly be adjusted. In addition, because the offering is aQualified IPO, and assuming our other credit facilities are either terminated oramended to allow the following, (1) we will be allowed to borrow an additional$225 million under the Credit Facility after June 30, 2008 to finance capitalenhancement projects if we are in pro forma compliance with the financialcovenants in the Credit Facility and the rating agencies confirm our ratings,(2) we will be allowed to pay an additional $35 million of dividends each year,if our corporate family ratings are at least B2 from Moodyâ€™s and B from S&P, (3)we will not be subject to any capital expenditures limitations commencing with fiscal 2009 if our total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.25:1 for anyquarter commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and (4) at any time after March 31, 2008 we will be allowed to reduce the Cash Flow Swap to not less than 35,000 barrels a day forfiscal 2008 and terminate the Cash Flow Swap for any year commencing with fiscal2009, so long as our total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.25:1 and wehave a corporate family rating of at least B2 from Moodyâ€™s and B from S&P. An affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. is the sole lender under the term loanfacility and, accordingly, will receive all of the net proceeds of this offeringthat we use to repay term loans under the Credit Facility. An affiliate ofGoldman, Sachs & Co. is the sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner under our$25 million unsecured facility and $25 million secured facility and,accordingly, will receive all of the net proceeds used to repay our $25 millionunsecured facility and $25 million secured facility. Affiliates of Goldman,Sachs & Co., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLCand Citibank Capital Markets Inc. are lenders under the revolving loan facilityand, accordingly, will receive substantially all of the net proceeds of thisoffering (or net proceeds received if the underwriters exercise their option topurchase additional shares from us) used to repay such revolving loans."

If we consummate an initial business combination,           $12,600,000 ($14,490,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is            exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters as deferred underwriting discounts         and commissions (subject to a $0.35 per share reduction for public                stockholders who exercise their conversion rights). (3)   These expenses include any reimbursements to be made to our executive             officers and directors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in             performing due diligence and activities in connection with the evaluation of      a potential business combination, as well as any potential fees that we may       pay to third parties, such as market research firms and other consultants,        that perform due diligence of a target business on our behalf (other than to      the extent such fees are paid by our executive officers and directors on our      behalf and such persons are reimbursed in the amount and to the extent of         such fees).                                                                    (4)   The not yet identified miscellaneous expenses include, without limitation,        the reimbursement of our executive officers and directors for out-of-pocket       expenses in connection with this offering, such as roadshow expenses and          advances for offering costs made by them and not covered by the amounts set       aside for offering expenses set forth on the table above and costs and            expenses associated with our liquidation.                                    After non-deferred expenses of this offering and the private placement,$354,346,881 (or $406,456,881 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option isexercised in full) will be deposited in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee.Except for payment of taxes and interest income earned of up to $2,700,000 tofund our working capital requirements, the proceeds will not be released fromthe trust account until the earlier of the consummation of an initial businesscombination or our liquidation. We expect to use the proceeds held in the trustaccount to acquire one or more domestic or foreign operating businesses.Interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable) will be held in thetrust account for use in consummating an initial business combination orreleased to investors upon exercise of their conversion rights or upon ourliquidation, as the case may be. However, we may not use all of the fundsremaining in the trust account in connection with a business combination, eitherbecause the consideration for the initial business combination is less than theproceeds in the trust account or because we finance a portion of theconsideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event, theremaining proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any other net proceedsnot expended, will constitute working capital for our business after our initialbusiness combination. While it is difficult to determine what the specificoperating expenses of our business after consummation of an initial businesscombination may be, we expect that they may include some or all of thefollowing: capital expenditures, general ongoing expenses, including overhead,payroll and costs involved in expanding markets and in developing strategicacquisitions or alliances. In addition, we may use any remaining proceeds heldin the trust account to satisfy any unpaid reimbursable out-of-pocket expensesincurred by our executive officers and directors, as well as any unpaid finderâ€™sfees or similar fees or compensation to the extent such expenses, fees orcompensation exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account.If we consummate an initial business combination, $12,600,000 (or $14,490,000 ifthe underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid tothe underwriters as deferred underwriting discounts and compensation, as setforth in this prospectus (subject to a $0.35 per share reduction for publicstockholders who exercise their conversion rights). Net proceeds of this offering and the private placement in the amount of$250,000 will not be held in the trust account and may be used to fund ouroperations up to the next 24 months, as described below. We expect to use approximately $1,000,000 for legal, accounting and otherexpenses attendant to the structuring and negotiation of an initial businesscombination, $1,000,000 for expenses related to due diligence and investigationof prospective target businesses, and $100,000 for legal and accounting feesrelating to SEC reporting obligations. We expect that due diligence ofprospective target businesses will be performed by some or all members of ourexecutive officers and directors and may include engaging market research andvaluation firms as well as other third-party consultants. None of our executiveofficers or directors will receive any compensation for any due diligenceefforts, other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incuron our behalf while performing due diligence of prospective target businesses.Any reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our discretion. Tothe extent such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds notdeposited in the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not bereimbursed by us unless and until we consummate a business combination. We have agreed to pay NRDC Capital Management, LLC a monthly fee of $7,500 forgeneral and administrative services, including office space, utilities andsecretarial support. We believe that, based on rents and fees for similarservices in Purchase, New York, the fees charged by NRDC Capital Management, LLCare at least as favorable as we could have obtained from unaffiliated thirdparties.We expect to use approximately $300,000 for premiums for director and officerinsurance for a 24-month period. In addition, we have reserved approximately$120,000 for the payment of corporate franchise taxes. We intend to use theexcess working capital (approximately $250,000) for other expenses incurred instructuring and negotiating an initial business combination and, if necessary,to cover the costs and expenses associated with our liquidation and winding-up(which we estimate would be in the range of $15,000 to $25,000). For example, wemay opt to make a deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees inconnection with structuring and negotiating our initial business combination.While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firmsthat specialize in business acquisitions, we may do so in the future to assistus in locating suitable target businesses, in which event we may pay a finderâ€™sfee, or other compensation. We have not reserved any specific amounts for adeposit, down payment, exclusivity fees, finderâ€™s fees or similar fees orcompensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the available netproceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing expensesand reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf. To theextent that any such fees or compensation exceeds the available proceeds notdeposited in the trust account, we would not be able to pay such fees orcompensation unless we consummate an initial business combination. In addition,the excess working capital will be used to cover miscellaneous expenses that wehave not yet identified, which may include, without limitation, thereimbursement of our executive officers and directors for out-of-pocket expensesin connection with this offering, such as roadshow expenses and advances foroffering costs made by them and not covered by the amounts set aside foroffering expenses described above. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering and the private placement,we will have sufficient available funds to operate at least for the next24 months, assuming that an initial business combination is not consummatedduring that time. The amount of available proceeds is based on our executiveofficersâ€™ estimate of the amount needed to fund our operations for the next24 months and to consummate a business combination. This belief is based on thefact that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken only after we havenegotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement thataddresses the terms of an initial business combination. Although we do not knowthe rate of interest to be earned on the trust account and are unable to predictan exact amount of time it will take to complete any initial businesscombination, we believe that following the completion of this offering, it willtake a significant amount of time to find a prospective target business and takeall of the steps necessary to complete an initial business combination. Weanticipate that, even at an interest rate of 3.0% per annum, the interest thatwill accrue on the trust account during the time it will take to identify atarget and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our workingcapital requirements. Given the limited amount of time it will take to generate$2,700,000 of interest on the trust account, we anticipate receiving suchinterest income generally shortly after we incur working capital expenses.However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence andnegotiating an initial business combination is less than the actual amountnecessary to do so, or if interest payments are not available to fund theexpenses at the time we incur them, we may be required to raise additionalcapital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currentlyunascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital throughloans or additional investments from members of our management team, but suchmembers of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,or invest in, us. To the extent that our expenses exceed the amounts not held inthe trust account and the interest income of up to $2,700,000 that may bereleased to us from the trust account subject to the tax holdback (as describedin more detail in this prospectus), such out-of-pocket expenses could not bereimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. Althoughour executive officers currently intend to continue to be involved in themanagement of the combined company after our initial business combination,because the role of our officers and directors after an initial businesscombination is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine whatremuneration, if any, will be paid to current officers and directors after ourinitial business combination. Our officers and directors may, as part of anysuch combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of the out-of-pocketexpenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed by us prior to theclosing of our initial business combination. If the owners of the targetbusiness do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our officers anddirectors to view such potential initial business combination unfavorably andresult in a potential conflict of interest.However, if we do not have sufficient proceeds available to cover our expenses,we may be required to obtain additional financing, either from our executiveofficers and directors, NRDC Capital Management, LLC or third parties. We maynot be able to obtain additional financing, and none of our management,including our executive officers and directors, our existing stockholders orNRDC Capital Management, LLC is obligated to provide any additional financing.If we do not have sufficient proceeds not held in the trust account and cannotfind additional financing, we may be required to dissolve and liquidate prior toconsummating an initial business combination. NRDC Capital Management, LLC has loaned a total of $200,000 to us for thepayment of offering expenses. The loan is interest free and will be repaid uponthe completion of this offering out of the gross proceeds. The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for thepurposes set forth above will be held in the trust account and invested only inmoney market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated underthe 1940 Act, or securities issued by the United States so that we are notdeemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act. Other than (i) the repayment of the $200,000 loan described above and(ii) administrative services arrangement for services rendered to us, nocompensation of any kind, including finderâ€™s and consulting fees, will be paidto any of our executive officers, directors, or existing stockholders or any oftheir respective affiliates prior to or in connection with the initial businesscombination. However, our executive officers and directors will receivereimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection withactivities on our behalf, such as participating in the offering process,identifying potential target businesses, and performing due diligence onsuitable business combinations. Although our executive officers currently intendto continue to be involved in the management of the combined company after ourinitial business combination, because the role of our current executive officersand directors after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have nocurrent ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to currentofficers and directors after an initial business combination. A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account,including interest earned on its pro rata portion of the funds in the trustaccount (net of taxes payable and after release of up to $2,700,000 of interestincome, after tax, to fund working capital requirements, including the costs ofour liquidation), only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure toconsummate an initial business combination or if that public stockholder were toseek to convert shares into cash in connection with our initial businesscombination that the public stockholder previously voted against and which weactually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder haveany right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

These         funds will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not held in the    trust account upon consummation of this offering.                            (2) Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this         offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 3%, or    $7,500,000 to be held in trust ($8,625,000 if the underwritersâ€™                  over-allotment option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business     combination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, the                underwritersâ€™ deferred discount shall be released to the underwriters out of     the gross proceeds of this offering held in a trust account at Banc of           America LLC, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting     as trustee. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on     the deferred discount.                                                       (3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $250,000        even if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised. We currently       estimate that we would require up to $50,000 should our corporate existence      cease to exist on October 17, 2009 to liquidate the company in the event we      do not consummate a business combination.                                    Of the net proceeds of this offering, $231,300,000 (or $266,175,000 if theunderwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $7,500,000 fromthe purchase of founder warrants, for an aggregate of $238,800,000 (or$273,675,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full)will be placed in a trust account at Banc of America LLC, maintained byContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.Additionally, $7,500,000 (or $8,625,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full) of the proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™deferred discount will be deposited into such trustee account for a total amountin trust of $246,300,000 (or $282,300,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full). The proceeds will not be released from the trustaccount until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or as partof any liquidation of our trust account. To the extent the trust account earnsinterest or we are deemed to have earned income in connection therewith, we willbe permitted to seek disbursements from the trust account to pay any federal,state or local tax obligations related thereto. The proceeds held in the trustaccount may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisitionwith which we complete a business combination (net of taxes and amountspermitted to be disbursed for working capital purposes and excluding the amountheld in the trust account representing the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount). Anyamounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business will beused to finance our operations, which may include the target business(es) weacquired on the consummation of the business combination, for maintenance orexpansion of operations of a target business(es), the payment of principal orinterest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial businesscombination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determinedby our board of directors at that time. We may use any remaining proceeds heldin the trust account for working capital, including director and officercompensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to payfinderâ€™s fees, finance the operations of the target acquisition, make otheracquisitions and pursue our growth strategy. All amounts held in the trustaccount that are not converted to cash or released to us as interest income, netof income taxes, will be released on closing of our initial business combinationwith a target acquisition having a fair market value of at least 80% of our netassets held in trust (net of taxes and amounts permitted to be disbursed forworking capital purposes and excluding the amount held in the trust accountrepresenting the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount) at the time of suchacquisition, subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of common stockissued in this offering voted by our public stockholders in favor of thebusiness combination and public stockholders owning less than 30% of the sharesof common stock issued in this offering voting against the proposed businesscombination and electing their conversion rights. Our founding stockholders willnot have such conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock ownedby them. The ability of a larger number of our stockholders to exercise theirconversion rights may not allow us to consummate the most desirable businesscombination or optimize our capital structure.We intend to use the $250,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust fordue diligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition includinginvestment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring andnegotiating business combination, as well as a possible down payment, â€œreverse break-up feeâ€ù (a provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up orâ€œno-shopâ€ù provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target acquisitions from â€œshoppingâ€ù around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target acquisitions), if necessary, to bear the costs of liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a business combination by October 17, 2009. While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respectto a particular proposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), if the amount were large enough and we had already used up the otherfunds available to us, could result in our not having sufficient funds tocontinue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potentialtarget acquisitions. In such case, if we were unable to secure additionalfinancing, we would most likely fail to consummate an initial businesscombination in the allotted time and be forced to liquidate. In addition to theuse of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to payfees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition.We believe that the interest income will be sufficient to cover the foregoingexpenses. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will mostlikely be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intentor other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial businesscombination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth duediligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than theactual amount of such costs, we may be required to raise additional capital, theamount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. To theextent that such expenses exceed the amounts not held in the trust account andthe interest income of up to $3,250,000 that may be released to us from thetrust account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unlesswe consummate an initial business combination. Since the role of presentmanagement after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have nocurrent ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to presentmanagement after our initial business combination. Our officers and directorsmay, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all ofthe out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed priorto the initial business combinationâ€™s closing. If the target businessâ€™s ownersdo not agree to such repayment, this could cause our officers and directors toview such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in aconflict of interest. We have adopted a policy that, prior to the consummationof a business combination, none of our strategic advisory council members orfounding stockholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, will bepaid, either by us or a target acquisition company, any finderâ€™s fee, consultingfee or other compensation for any services they render in order to effectuatethe consummation of a business combination, other than the reimbursement,subject to approval of our board of directors, of out-of-pocket expenses, themonthly fee to Trillium Capital LLC and fees that Americaâ€™s Growth Capital, ofwhich Mr. Howe, one of our directors, is Chief Executive Officer, may beentitled to as a result of any acquisition opportunities referred to us.With respect to finderâ€™s fees, we do not currently anticipate that we wouldenter into any arrangement which would require us to pay a finderâ€™s fee prior tothe consummation of a business combination. If such a business combination isconsummated, it is possible that a portion of the funds held in trust, oncereleased, will be utilized to pay such finderâ€™s fees. Even if such a businesscombination is not consummated, it is possible that we would incur an obligationto an individual or an entity to pay them either a finderâ€™s fee and/or toreimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provide to us. Wewould anticipate such fees or expenses being paid from the funds held outside ofthe trust account (including up to $3,250,000 of interest earned on the amountsheld in the trust account). If we are unable to complete a business combinationand liquidate the company, our officers will be jointly and severally liable toensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced if we did notobtain a valid and enforceable waiver from vendors, service providers, or otherentities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for orproducts sold to us, as well as any prospective target businesses for fees andexpenses of third parties that we agree in writing to pay in the event we do notconsummate a combination with such target business. Consequently, if we incur anobligation to an individual or an entity to pay them either a finderâ€™s feeand/or to reimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provideto us, such an individual or entity has not signed an enforceable waiver oftheir right to obtain funds from the trust account, we do not ultimatelyconsummate a business combination and we do not have sufficient funds to paysuch fees or expenses from the funds held outside of the trust account, ourofficers will be jointly and severally liable for such fees and expenses.To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or inpart as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event thatindebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as considerationto effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account whichare not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to thecombined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, beused as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third partyindebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors would not bepersonally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness.We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a businesscombination, either because the consideration for the business combination isless than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of theconsideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event, theproceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds notexpended will be used to finance our operations, which may include the targetbusiness(es) that we acquire on the business combination, for maintenance orexpansion of operations of a target business(es), the payment of principal orinterest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial businesscombination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determinedby our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, among otherthings, for director and officer compensation, change-in-control payments orpayments to affiliates, to finance the operations of the target acquisition, tomake other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy.In the event that third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of theexpenses of this offering, our officers would be personally liable for therepayment of such indebtedness. Certain of our officers and directors haveloaned to us a total of $200,000, which principal amount may be increased by anaggregate amount of $50,000 at our request, which is expected to be used to paya portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items abovefor SEC registration fees, FINRA registration fees, AMEX application and listingfees, blue sky filing fees, and legal and audit fees and expenses. The loanbears interest at an annual rate of 5%, compounded semi-annually, and is due onthe earlier of August 31, 2008 and the consummation of this offering. The loanwill be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not held in trust.The proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in UnitedStates â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of theInvestment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in moneymarket funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under theInvestment Company Act of 1940. Although the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust account, andalthough we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will take tocomplete a business combination, we anticipate the interest that will accrue onthe trust account, even at an interest rate of 4% (up to $3,250,000 interest income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the trust account),during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. While we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this rate, we believe such rate is representative of that which we may receive. By restricting the holdings in thetrust account to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distribute the trust accountto holders of our common stock sold in this offering until after our existenceterminates by operation of law on October 17, 2009 and, consequently, we may bedeemed to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such act. The interest income derived from the holdings in the trust account during this period that is not otherwise returned to public stockholders, other than our founding stockholders, who vote against a business combination will be used todefray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. We do not believethat the fees and expenses for due diligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, down payment, lock-up or other activities related to this offering or our business combination will exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate, comprised of $250,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust plus up to $3,250,000 of net interest income. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months,assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time.We intend to pay Trillium Capital LLC, a limited liability company affiliatedwith our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, R. Scott Murray, a monthly fee of $10,000 for general andadministrative services including office space and administrative, technologyand secretarial services. This arrangement is expected to be agreed to byTrillium Capital LLC or its affiliate for our benefit and is not intended toprovide our officers or directors compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe,based on fees for similar services in the Boston metropolitan area, that the feeexpected to be charged by Trillium Capital LLC or its affiliate is at least asfavorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Thisarrangement will terminate upon consummation of our business combination or thedistribution of the trust account to our public stockholders on a pro ratabasis. We have adopted a policy that, prior to the consummation of a businesscombination, none of our strategic advisory council members or foundingstockholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, will be paid, eitherby us or a target acquisition company, any finderâ€™s fee, consulting fee or othercompensation for any services they render in order to effectuate theconsummation of a business combination, other than the reimbursement, subject toapproval of our board of directors, of out-of-pocket expenses, as describedbelow, the monthly fee to Trillium Capital LLC and fees that Americaâ€™s GrowthCapital, of which Mr. Howe, one of our directors, is Chief Executive Officer,may be entitled to as a result of any acquisition opportunities referred to us.However, our founding stockholders may receive reimbursement, subject to boardapproval, for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection withactivities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses andperforming due diligence on suitable business combinations, as well as travelingto and from the offices, service centers or similar locations of prospectivetarget acquisitions to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenseswill be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated inthe above table to â€œLegal, accounting, investment banking and other expensesattendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of abusiness combination,â€ù â€œDue diligence of prospective target businessesâ€ù and â€œWorking capital.â€ù Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.A public stockholder, other than our founding stockholders, will be entitled toreceive funds from the trust account (including interest earned on suchstockholderâ€™s portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable and amountspermitted to be disbursed for working capital purposes) only in the event of ourliquidation of the trust account as part of our liquidation upon our failure tocomplete a business combination, or if such public stockholder converts hisshares of common stock into cash in connection with a business combination thatthe public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate; however,our founding stockholders will not be entitled to receive such funds from thetrust account upon liquidation with respect to any shares of common stock ownedby them immediately before this offering and our founding stockholders will nothave such conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned bythem into a pro rata share of the trust account. In no other circumstances willa public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trustaccount.Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will beentitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to theunderwritersâ€™ deferred discount held in trust excluding any accrued interestthereon, net of the pro rata amount of the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount paidto stockholders who both vote against the business combination and exercisetheir conversion rights. In the event that we are unable to consummate abusiness combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,the underwriters have agreed that the proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™deferred discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the publicstockholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

$200,000 loan from        certain of our officers and directors, as further described below. These         funds will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not held in the    trust account upon consummation of this offering.                            (2) Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this         offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 3%, or    $7,500,000 to be held in trust ($8,625,000 if the underwritersâ€™                  over-allotment option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business     combination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, the                underwritersâ€™ deferred discount shall be released to the underwriters out of     the gross proceeds of this offering held in a trust account at Banc of           America LLC, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting     as trustee. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on     the deferred discount.                                                       (3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $250,000        even if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised. We currently       estimate that we would require up to $50,000 should our corporate existence      cease to exist on October 17, 2009 to liquidate the company in the event we      do not consummate a business combination.                                    Of the net proceeds of this offering, $231,300,000 (or $266,175,000 if theunderwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $7,500,000 fromthe purchase of founder warrants, for an aggregate of $238,800,000 (or$273,675,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full)will be placed in a trust account at Banc of America LLC, maintained byContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.Additionally, $7,500,000 (or $8,625,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full) of the proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™deferred discount will be deposited into such trustee account for a total amountin trust of $246,300,000 (or $282,300,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full). The proceeds will not be released from the trustaccount until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or as partof any liquidation of our trust account. To the extent the trust account earnsinterest or we are deemed to have earned income in connection therewith, we willbe permitted to seek disbursements from the trust account to pay any federal,state or local tax obligations related thereto. The proceeds held in the trustaccount may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisitionwith which we complete a business combination (net of taxes and amountspermitted to be disbursed for working capital purposes and excluding the amountheld in the trust account representing the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount). Anyamounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business will beused to finance our operations, which may include the target business(es) weacquired on the consummation of the business combination, for maintenance orexpansion of operations of a target business(es), the payment of principal orinterest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial businesscombination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determinedby our board of directors at that time. We may use any remaining proceeds heldin the trust account for working capital, including director and officercompensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to payfinderâ€™s fees, finance the operations of the target acquisition, make otheracquisitions and pursue our growth strategy. All amounts held in the trustaccount that are not converted to cash or released to us as interest income, netof income taxes, will be released on closing of our initial business combinationwith a target acquisition having a fair market value of at least 80% of our netassets held in trust (net of taxes and amounts permitted to be disbursed forworking capital purposes and excluding the amount held in the trust accountrepresenting the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount) at the time of suchacquisition, subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of common stockissued in this offering voted by our public stockholders in favor of thebusiness combination and public stockholders owning less than 30% of the sharesof common stock issued in this offering voting against the proposed businesscombination and electing their conversion rights. Our founding stockholders willnot have such conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock ownedby them. The ability of a larger number of our stockholders to exercise theirconversion rights may not allow us to consummate the most desirable businesscombination or optimize our capital structure.We intend to use the $250,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust fordue diligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition includinginvestment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring andnegotiating business combination, as well as a possible down payment, â€œreverse break-up feeâ€ù (a provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up orâ€œno-shopâ€ù provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target acquisitions from â€œshoppingâ€ù around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target acquisitions), if necessary, to bear the costs of liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a business combination by October 17, 2009. While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respectto a particular proposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), if the amount were large enough and we had already used up the otherfunds available to us, could result in our not having sufficient funds tocontinue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potentialtarget acquisitions. In such case, if we were unable to secure additionalfinancing, we would most likely fail to consummate an initial businesscombination in the allotted time and be forced to liquidate. In addition to theuse of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to payfees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition.We believe that the interest income will be sufficient to cover the foregoingexpenses. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will mostlikely be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intentor other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial businesscombination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth duediligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than theactual amount of such costs, we may be required to raise additional capital, theamount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. To theextent that such expenses exceed the amounts not held in the trust account andthe interest income of up to $3,250,000 that may be released to us from thetrust account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unlesswe consummate an initial business combination. Since the role of presentmanagement after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have nocurrent ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to presentmanagement after our initial business combination. Our officers and directorsmay, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all ofthe out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed priorto the initial business combinationâ€™s closing. If the target businessâ€™s ownersdo not agree to such repayment, this could cause our officers and directors toview such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in aconflict of interest. We have adopted a policy that, prior to the consummationof a business combination, none of our strategic advisory council members orfounding stockholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, will bepaid, either by us or a target acquisition company, any finderâ€™s fee, consultingfee or other compensation for any services they render in order to effectuatethe consummation of a business combination, other than the reimbursement,subject to approval of our board of directors, of out-of-pocket expenses, themonthly fee to Trillium Capital LLC and fees that Americaâ€™s Growth Capital, ofwhich Mr. Howe, one of our directors, is Chief Executive Officer, may beentitled to as a result of any acquisition opportunities referred to us.With respect to finderâ€™s fees, we do not currently anticipate that we wouldenter into any arrangement which would require us to pay a finderâ€™s fee prior tothe consummation of a business combination. If such a business combination isconsummated, it is possible that a portion of the funds held in trust, oncereleased, will be utilized to pay such finderâ€™s fees. Even if such a businesscombination is not consummated, it is possible that we would incur an obligationto an individual or an entity to pay them either a finderâ€™s fee and/or toreimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provide to us. Wewould anticipate such fees or expenses being paid from the funds held outside ofthe trust account (including up to $3,250,000 of interest earned on the amountsheld in the trust account). If we are unable to complete a business combinationand liquidate the company, our officers will be jointly and severally liable toensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced if we did notobtain a valid and enforceable waiver from vendors, service providers, or otherentities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for orproducts sold to us, as well as any prospective target businesses for fees andexpenses of third parties that we agree in writing to pay in the event we do notconsummate a combination with such target business. Consequently, if we incur anobligation to an individual or an entity to pay them either a finderâ€™s feeand/or to reimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provideto us, such an individual or entity has not signed an enforceable waiver oftheir right to obtain funds from the trust account, we do not ultimatelyconsummate a business combination and we do not have sufficient funds to paysuch fees or expenses from the funds held outside of the trust account, ourofficers will be jointly and severally liable for such fees and expenses.To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or inpart as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event thatindebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as considerationto effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account whichare not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to thecombined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, beused as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third partyindebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors would not bepersonally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness.We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a businesscombination, either because the consideration for the business combination isless than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of theconsideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event, theproceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds notexpended will be used to finance our operations, which may include the targetbusiness(es) that we acquire on the business combination, for maintenance orexpansion of operations of a target business(es), the payment of principal orinterest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial businesscombination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determinedby our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, among otherthings, for director and officer compensation, change-in-control payments orpayments to affiliates, to finance the operations of the target acquisition, tomake other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy.In the event that third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of theexpenses of this offering, our officers would be personally liable for therepayment of such indebtedness. Certain of our officers and directors haveloaned to us a total of $200,000, which principal amount may be increased by anaggregate amount of $50,000 at our request, which is expected to be used to paya portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items abovefor SEC registration fees, FINRA registration fees, AMEX application and listingfees, blue sky filing fees, and legal and audit fees and expenses. The loanbears interest at an annual rate of 5%, compounded semi-annually, and is due onthe earlier of August 31, 2008 and the consummation of this offering. The loanwill be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not held in trust.The proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in UnitedStates â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of theInvestment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in moneymarket funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under theInvestment Company Act of 1940. Although the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust account, andalthough we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will take tocomplete a business combination, we anticipate the interest that will accrue onthe trust account, even at an interest rate of 4% (up to $3,250,000 interest income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the trust account),during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. While we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this rate, we believe such rate is representative of that which we may receive. By restricting the holdings in thetrust account to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distribute the trust accountto holders of our common stock sold in this offering until after our existenceterminates by operation of law on October 17, 2009 and, consequently, we may bedeemed to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such act. The interest income derived from the holdings in the trust account during this period that is not otherwise returned to public stockholders, other than our founding stockholders, who vote against a business combination will be used todefray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. We do not believethat the fees and expenses for due diligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, down payment, lock-up or other activities related to this offering or our business combination will exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate, comprised of $250,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust plus up to $3,250,000 of net interest income. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months,assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time.We intend to pay Trillium Capital LLC, a limited liability company affiliatedwith our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, R. Scott Murray, a monthly fee of $10,000 for general andadministrative services including office space and administrative, technologyand secretarial services. This arrangement is expected to be agreed to byTrillium Capital LLC or its affiliate for our benefit and is not intended toprovide our officers or directors compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe,based on fees for similar services in the Boston metropolitan area, that the feeexpected to be charged by Trillium Capital LLC or its affiliate is at least asfavorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Thisarrangement will terminate upon consummation of our business combination or thedistribution of the trust account to our public stockholders on a pro ratabasis. We have adopted a policy that, prior to the consummation of a businesscombination, none of our strategic advisory council members or foundingstockholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, will be paid, eitherby us or a target acquisition company, any finderâ€™s fee, consulting fee or othercompensation for any services they render in order to effectuate theconsummation of a business combination, other than the reimbursement, subject toapproval of our board of directors, of out-of-pocket expenses, as describedbelow, the monthly fee to Trillium Capital LLC and fees that Americaâ€™s GrowthCapital, of which Mr. Howe, one of our directors, is Chief Executive Officer,may be entitled to as a result of any acquisition opportunities referred to us.However, our founding stockholders may receive reimbursement, subject to boardapproval, for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection withactivities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses andperforming due diligence on suitable business combinations, as well as travelingto and from the offices, service centers or similar locations of prospectivetarget acquisitions to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenseswill be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated inthe above table to â€œLegal, accounting, investment banking and other expensesattendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of abusiness combination,â€ù â€œDue diligence of prospective target businessesâ€ù and â€œWorking capital.â€ù Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.A public stockholder, other than our founding stockholders, will be entitled toreceive funds from the trust account (including interest earned on suchstockholderâ€™s portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable and amountspermitted to be disbursed for working capital purposes) only in the event of ourliquidation of the trust account as part of our liquidation upon our failure tocomplete a business combination, or if such public stockholder converts hisshares of common stock into cash in connection with a business combination thatthe public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate; however,our founding stockholders will not be entitled to receive such funds from thetrust account upon liquidation with respect to any shares of common stock ownedby them immediately before this offering and our founding stockholders will nothave such conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned bythem into a pro rata share of the trust account. In no other circumstances willa public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trustaccount.Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will beentitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to theunderwritersâ€™ deferred discount held in trust excluding any accrued interestthereon, net of the pro rata amount of the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount paidto stockholders who both vote against the business combination and exercisetheir conversion rights. In the event that we are unable to consummate abusiness combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,the underwriters have agreed that the proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™deferred discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the publicstockholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

$200,000 loan from        certain of our officers and directors, as further described below. These         funds will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not held in the    trust account upon consummation of this offering.                            (2) Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this         offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 3%, or    $7,500,000 to be held in trust ($8,625,000 if the underwritersâ€™                  over-allotment option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business     combination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, the                underwritersâ€™ deferred discount shall be released to the underwriters out of     the gross proceeds of this offering held in a trust account at Banc of           America LLC, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting     as trustee. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on     the deferred discount.                                                       (3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $250,000        even if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised. We currently       estimate that we would require up to $50,000 should our corporate existence      cease to exist on October 17, 2009 to liquidate the company in the event we      do not consummate a business combination.                                    Of the net proceeds of this offering, $231,300,000 (or $266,175,000 if theunderwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $7,500,000 fromthe purchase of founder warrants, for an aggregate of $238,800,000 (or$273,675,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full)will be placed in a trust account at Banc of America LLC, maintained byContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.Additionally, $7,500,000 (or $8,625,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full) of the proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™deferred discount will be deposited into such trustee account for a total amountin trust of $246,300,000 (or $282,300,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full). The proceeds will not be released from the trustaccount until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or as partof any liquidation of our trust account. To the extent the trust account earnsinterest or we are deemed to have earned income in connection therewith, we willbe permitted to seek disbursements from the trust account to pay any federal,state or local tax obligations related thereto. The proceeds held in the trustaccount may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisitionwith which we complete a business combination (net of taxes and amountspermitted to be disbursed for working capital purposes and excluding the amountheld in the trust account representing the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount). Anyamounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business will beused to finance our operations, which may include the target business(es) weacquired on the consummation of the business combination, for maintenance orexpansion of operations of a target business(es), the payment of principal orinterest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial businesscombination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determinedby our board of directors at that time. We may use any remaining proceeds heldin the trust account for working capital, including director and officercompensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to payfinderâ€™s fees, finance the operations of the target acquisition, make otheracquisitions and pursue our growth strategy. All amounts held in the trustaccount that are not converted to cash or released to us as interest income, netof income taxes, will be released on closing of our initial business combinationwith a target acquisition having a fair market value of at least 80% of our netassets held in trust (net of taxes and amounts permitted to be disbursed forworking capital purposes and excluding the amount held in the trust accountrepresenting the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount) at the time of suchacquisition, subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of common stockissued in this offering voted by our public stockholders in favor of thebusiness combination and public stockholders owning less than 30% of the sharesof common stock issued in this offering voting against the proposed businesscombination and electing their conversion rights. Our founding stockholders willnot have such conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock ownedby them. The ability of a larger number of our stockholders to exercise theirconversion rights may not allow us to consummate the most desirable businesscombination or optimize our capital structure.We intend to use the $250,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust fordue diligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition includinginvestment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring andnegotiating business combination, as well as a possible down payment, â€œreverse break-up feeâ€ù (a provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up orâ€œno-shopâ€ù provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target acquisitions from â€œshoppingâ€ù around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target acquisitions), if necessary, to bear the costs of liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a business combination by October 17, 2009. While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respectto a particular proposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), if the amount were large enough and we had already used up the otherfunds available to us, could result in our not having sufficient funds tocontinue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potentialtarget acquisitions. In such case, if we were unable to secure additionalfinancing, we would most likely fail to consummate an initial businesscombination in the allotted time and be forced to liquidate. In addition to theuse of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to payfees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition.We believe that the interest income will be sufficient to cover the foregoingexpenses. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will mostlikely be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intentor other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial businesscombination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth duediligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than theactual amount of such costs, we may be required to raise additional capital, theamount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. To theextent that such expenses exceed the amounts not held in the trust account andthe interest income of up to $3,250,000 that may be released to us from thetrust account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unlesswe consummate an initial business combination. Since the role of presentmanagement after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have nocurrent ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to presentmanagement after our initial business combination. Our officers and directorsmay, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all ofthe out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed priorto the initial business combinationâ€™s closing. If the target businessâ€™s ownersdo not agree to such repayment, this could cause our officers and directors toview such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in aconflict of interest. We have adopted a policy that, prior to the consummationof a business combination, none of our strategic advisory council members orfounding stockholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, will bepaid, either by us or a target acquisition company, any finderâ€™s fee, consultingfee or other compensation for any services they render in order to effectuatethe consummation of a business combination, other than the reimbursement,subject to approval of our board of directors, of out-of-pocket expenses, themonthly fee to Trillium Capital LLC and fees that Americaâ€™s Growth Capital, ofwhich Mr. Howe, one of our directors, is Chief Executive Officer, may beentitled to as a result of any acquisition opportunities referred to us.With respect to finderâ€™s fees, we do not currently anticipate that we wouldenter into any arrangement which would require us to pay a finderâ€™s fee prior tothe consummation of a business combination. If such a business combination isconsummated, it is possible that a portion of the funds held in trust, oncereleased, will be utilized to pay such finderâ€™s fees. Even if such a businesscombination is not consummated, it is possible that we would incur an obligationto an individual or an entity to pay them either a finderâ€™s fee and/or toreimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provide to us. Wewould anticipate such fees or expenses being paid from the funds held outside ofthe trust account (including up to $3,250,000 of interest earned on the amountsheld in the trust account). If we are unable to complete a business combinationand liquidate the company, our officers will be jointly and severally liable toensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced if we did notobtain a valid and enforceable waiver from vendors, service providers, or otherentities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for orproducts sold to us, as well as any prospective target businesses for fees andexpenses of third parties that we agree in writing to pay in the event we do notconsummate a combination with such target business. Consequently, if we incur anobligation to an individual or an entity to pay them either a finderâ€™s feeand/or to reimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provideto us, such an individual or entity has not signed an enforceable waiver oftheir right to obtain funds from the trust account, we do not ultimatelyconsummate a business combination and we do not have sufficient funds to paysuch fees or expenses from the funds held outside of the trust account, ourofficers will be jointly and severally liable for such fees and expenses.To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or inpart as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event thatindebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as considerationto effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account whichare not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to thecombined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, beused as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third partyindebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors would not bepersonally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness.We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a businesscombination, either because the consideration for the business combination isless than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of theconsideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event, theproceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds notexpended will be used to finance our operations, which may include the targetbusiness(es) that we acquire on the business combination, for maintenance orexpansion of operations of a target business(es), the payment of principal orinterest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial businesscombination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determinedby our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, among otherthings, for director and officer compensation, change-in-control payments orpayments to affiliates, to finance the operations of the target acquisition, tomake other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy.In the event that third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of theexpenses of this offering, our officers would be personally liable for therepayment of such indebtedness. Certain of our officers and directors haveloaned to us a total of $200,000, which principal amount may be increased by anaggregate amount of $50,000 at our request, which is expected to be used to paya portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items abovefor SEC registration fees, FINRA registration fees, AMEX application and listingfees, blue sky filing fees, and legal and audit fees and expenses. The loanbears interest at an annual rate of 5%, compounded semi-annually, and is due onthe earlier of August 31, 2008 and the consummation of this offering. The loanwill be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not held in trust.The proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in UnitedStates â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of theInvestment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in moneymarket funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under theInvestment Company Act of 1940. Although the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust account, andalthough we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will take tocomplete a business combination, we anticipate the interest that will accrue onthe trust account, even at an interest rate of 4% (up to $3,250,000 interest income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the trust account),during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. While we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this rate, we believe such rate is representative of that which we may receive. By restricting the holdings in thetrust account to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distribute the trust accountto holders of our common stock sold in this offering until after our existenceterminates by operation of law on October 17, 2009 and, consequently, we may bedeemed to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such act. The interest income derived from the holdings in the trust account during this period that is not otherwise returned to public stockholders, other than our founding stockholders, who vote against a business combination will be used todefray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. We do not believethat the fees and expenses for due diligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, down payment, lock-up or other activities related to this offering or our business combination will exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate, comprised of $250,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust plus up to $3,250,000 of net interest income. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months,assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time.We intend to pay Trillium Capital LLC, a limited liability company affiliatedwith our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, R. Scott Murray, a monthly fee of $10,000 for general andadministrative services including office space and administrative, technologyand secretarial services. This arrangement is expected to be agreed to byTrillium Capital LLC or its affiliate for our benefit and is not intended toprovide our officers or directors compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe,based on fees for similar services in the Boston metropolitan area, that the feeexpected to be charged by Trillium Capital LLC or its affiliate is at least asfavorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Thisarrangement will terminate upon consummation of our business combination or thedistribution of the trust account to our public stockholders on a pro ratabasis. We have adopted a policy that, prior to the consummation of a businesscombination, none of our strategic advisory council members or foundingstockholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, will be paid, eitherby us or a target acquisition company, any finderâ€™s fee, consulting fee or othercompensation for any services they render in order to effectuate theconsummation of a business combination, other than the reimbursement, subject toapproval of our board of directors, of out-of-pocket expenses, as describedbelow, the monthly fee to Trillium Capital LLC and fees that Americaâ€™s GrowthCapital, of which Mr. Howe, one of our directors, is Chief Executive Officer,may be entitled to as a result of any acquisition opportunities referred to us.However, our founding stockholders may receive reimbursement, subject to boardapproval, for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection withactivities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses andperforming due diligence on suitable business combinations, as well as travelingto and from the offices, service centers or similar locations of prospectivetarget acquisitions to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenseswill be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated inthe above table to â€œLegal, accounting, investment banking and other expensesattendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of abusiness combination,â€ù â€œDue diligence of prospective target businessesâ€ù and â€œWorking capital.â€ù Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.A public stockholder, other than our founding stockholders, will be entitled toreceive funds from the trust account (including interest earned on suchstockholderâ€™s portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable and amountspermitted to be disbursed for working capital purposes) only in the event of ourliquidation of the trust account as part of our liquidation upon our failure tocomplete a business combination, or if such public stockholder converts hisshares of common stock into cash in connection with a business combination thatthe public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate; however,our founding stockholders will not be entitled to receive such funds from thetrust account upon liquidation with respect to any shares of common stock ownedby them immediately before this offering and our founding stockholders will nothave such conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned bythem into a pro rata share of the trust account. In no other circumstances willa public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trustaccount.Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will beentitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to theunderwritersâ€™ deferred discount held in trust excluding any accrued interestthereon, net of the pro rata amount of the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount paidto stockholders who both vote against the business combination and exercisetheir conversion rights. In the event that we are unable to consummate abusiness combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,the underwriters have agreed that the proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™deferred discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the publicstockholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

$200,000 loan from        certain of our officers and directors, as further described below. These         funds will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not held in the    trust account upon consummation of this offering.                            (2) Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this         offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 3%, or    $7,500,000 to be held in trust ($8,625,000 if the underwritersâ€™                  over-allotment option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business     combination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, the                underwritersâ€™ deferred discount shall be released to the underwriters out of     the gross proceeds of this offering held in a trust account at Banc of           America LLC, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting     as trustee. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on     the deferred discount.                                                       (3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $250,000        even if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised. We currently       estimate that we would require up to $50,000 should our corporate existence      cease to exist on October 17, 2009 to liquidate the company in the event we      do not consummate a business combination.                                    Of the net proceeds of this offering, $231,300,000 (or $266,175,000 if theunderwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $7,500,000 fromthe purchase of founder warrants, for an aggregate of $238,800,000 (or$273,675,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full)will be placed in a trust account at Banc of America LLC, maintained byContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.Additionally, $7,500,000 (or $8,625,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full) of the proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™deferred discount will be deposited into such trustee account for a total amountin trust of $246,300,000 (or $282,300,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full). The proceeds will not be released from the trustaccount until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or as partof any liquidation of our trust account. To the extent the trust account earnsinterest or we are deemed to have earned income in connection therewith, we willbe permitted to seek disbursements from the trust account to pay any federal,state or local tax obligations related thereto. The proceeds held in the trustaccount may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisitionwith which we complete a business combination (net of taxes and amountspermitted to be disbursed for working capital purposes and excluding the amountheld in the trust account representing the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount). Anyamounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business will beused to finance our operations, which may include the target business(es) weacquired on the consummation of the business combination, for maintenance orexpansion of operations of a target business(es), the payment of principal orinterest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial businesscombination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determinedby our board of directors at that time. We may use any remaining proceeds heldin the trust account for working capital, including director and officercompensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to payfinderâ€™s fees, finance the operations of the target acquisition, make otheracquisitions and pursue our growth strategy. All amounts held in the trustaccount that are not converted to cash or released to us as interest income, netof income taxes, will be released on closing of our initial business combinationwith a target acquisition having a fair market value of at least 80% of our netassets held in trust (net of taxes and amounts permitted to be disbursed forworking capital purposes and excluding the amount held in the trust accountrepresenting the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount) at the time of suchacquisition, subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of common stockissued in this offering voted by our public stockholders in favor of thebusiness combination and public stockholders owning less than 30% of the sharesof common stock issued in this offering voting against the proposed businesscombination and electing their conversion rights. Our founding stockholders willnot have such conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock ownedby them. The ability of a larger number of our stockholders to exercise theirconversion rights may not allow us to consummate the most desirable businesscombination or optimize our capital structure.We intend to use the $250,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust fordue diligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition includinginvestment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring andnegotiating business combination, as well as a possible down payment, â€œreverse break-up feeâ€ù (a provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up orâ€œno-shopâ€ù provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target acquisitions from â€œshoppingâ€ù around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target acquisitions), if necessary, to bear the costs of liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a business combination by October 17, 2009. While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respectto a particular proposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), if the amount were large enough and we had already used up the otherfunds available to us, could result in our not having sufficient funds tocontinue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potentialtarget acquisitions. In such case, if we were unable to secure additionalfinancing, we would most likely fail to consummate an initial businesscombination in the allotted time and be forced to liquidate. In addition to theuse of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to payfees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition.We believe that the interest income will be sufficient to cover the foregoingexpenses. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will mostlikely be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intentor other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial businesscombination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth duediligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than theactual amount of such costs, we may be required to raise additional capital, theamount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. To theextent that such expenses exceed the amounts not held in the trust account andthe interest income of up to $3,250,000 that may be released to us from thetrust account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unlesswe consummate an initial business combination. Since the role of presentmanagement after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have nocurrent ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to presentmanagement after our initial business combination. Our officers and directorsmay, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all ofthe out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed priorto the initial business combinationâ€™s closing. If the target businessâ€™s ownersdo not agree to such repayment, this could cause our officers and directors toview such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in aconflict of interest. We have adopted a policy that, prior to the consummationof a business combination, none of our strategic advisory council members orfounding stockholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, will bepaid, either by us or a target acquisition company, any finderâ€™s fee, consultingfee or other compensation for any services they render in order to effectuatethe consummation of a business combination, other than the reimbursement,subject to approval of our board of directors, of out-of-pocket expenses, themonthly fee to Trillium Capital LLC and fees that Americaâ€™s Growth Capital, ofwhich Mr. Howe, one of our directors, is Chief Executive Officer, may beentitled to as a result of any acquisition opportunities referred to us.With respect to finderâ€™s fees, we do not currently anticipate that we wouldenter into any arrangement which would require us to pay a finderâ€™s fee prior tothe consummation of a business combination. If such a business combination isconsummated, it is possible that a portion of the funds held in trust, oncereleased, will be utilized to pay such finderâ€™s fees. Even if such a businesscombination is not consummated, it is possible that we would incur an obligationto an individual or an entity to pay them either a finderâ€™s fee and/or toreimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provide to us. Wewould anticipate such fees or expenses being paid from the funds held outside ofthe trust account (including up to $3,250,000 of interest earned on the amountsheld in the trust account). If we are unable to complete a business combinationand liquidate the company, our officers will be jointly and severally liable toensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced if we did notobtain a valid and enforceable waiver from vendors, service providers, or otherentities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for orproducts sold to us, as well as any prospective target businesses for fees andexpenses of third parties that we agree in writing to pay in the event we do notconsummate a combination with such target business. Consequently, if we incur anobligation to an individual or an entity to pay them either a finderâ€™s feeand/or to reimburse their expenses in connection with services that they provideto us, such an individual or entity has not signed an enforceable waiver oftheir right to obtain funds from the trust account, we do not ultimatelyconsummate a business combination and we do not have sufficient funds to paysuch fees or expenses from the funds held outside of the trust account, ourofficers will be jointly and severally liable for such fees and expenses.To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or inpart as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event thatindebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as considerationto effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account whichare not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to thecombined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, beused as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third partyindebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors would not bepersonally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness.We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a businesscombination, either because the consideration for the business combination isless than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of theconsideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event, theproceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds notexpended will be used to finance our operations, which may include the targetbusiness(es) that we acquire on the business combination, for maintenance orexpansion of operations of a target business(es), the payment of principal orinterest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial businesscombination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determinedby our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, among otherthings, for director and officer compensation, change-in-control payments orpayments to affiliates, to finance the operations of the target acquisition, tomake other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy.In the event that third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of theexpenses of this offering, our officers would be personally liable for therepayment of such indebtedness. Certain of our officers and directors haveloaned to us a total of $200,000, which principal amount may be increased by anaggregate amount of $50,000 at our request, which is expected to be used to paya portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items abovefor SEC registration fees, FINRA registration fees, AMEX application and listingfees, blue sky filing fees, and legal and audit fees and expenses. The loanbears interest at an annual rate of 5%, compounded semi-annually, and is due onthe earlier of August 31, 2008 and the consummation of this offering. The loanwill be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not held in trust.The proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in UnitedStates â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of theInvestment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in moneymarket funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under theInvestment Company Act of 1940. Although the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust account, andalthough we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will take tocomplete a business combination, we anticipate the interest that will accrue onthe trust account, even at an interest rate of 4% (up to $3,250,000 interest income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the trust account),during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. While we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this rate, we believe such rate is representative of that which we may receive. By restricting the holdings in thetrust account to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distribute the trust accountto holders of our common stock sold in this offering until after our existenceterminates by operation of law on October 17, 2009 and, consequently, we may bedeemed to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such act. The interest income derived from the holdings in the trust account during this period that is not otherwise returned to public stockholders, other than our founding stockholders, who vote against a business combination will be used todefray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. We do not believethat the fees and expenses for due diligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, down payment, lock-up or other activities related to this offering or our business combination will exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate, comprised of $250,000 of net proceeds initially not held in trust plus up to $3,250,000 of net interest income. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months,assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time.We intend to pay Trillium Capital LLC, a limited liability company affiliatedwith our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, R. Scott Murray, a monthly fee of $10,000 for general andadministrative services including office space and administrative, technologyand secretarial services. This arrangement is expected to be agreed to byTrillium Capital LLC or its affiliate for our benefit and is not intended toprovide our officers or directors compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe,based on fees for similar services in the Boston metropolitan area, that the feeexpected to be charged by Trillium Capital LLC or its affiliate is at least asfavorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Thisarrangement will terminate upon consummation of our business combination or thedistribution of the trust account to our public stockholders on a pro ratabasis. We have adopted a policy that, prior to the consummation of a businesscombination, none of our strategic advisory council members or foundingstockholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, will be paid, eitherby us or a target acquisition company, any finderâ€™s fee, consulting fee or othercompensation for any services they render in order to effectuate theconsummation of a business combination, other than the reimbursement, subject toapproval of our board of directors, of out-of-pocket expenses, as describedbelow, the monthly fee to Trillium Capital LLC and fees that Americaâ€™s GrowthCapital, of which Mr. Howe, one of our directors, is Chief Executive Officer,may be entitled to as a result of any acquisition opportunities referred to us.However, our founding stockholders may receive reimbursement, subject to boardapproval, for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection withactivities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses andperforming due diligence on suitable business combinations, as well as travelingto and from the offices, service centers or similar locations of prospectivetarget acquisitions to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenseswill be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated inthe above table to â€œLegal, accounting, investment banking and other expensesattendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of abusiness combination,â€ù â€œDue diligence of prospective target businessesâ€ù and â€œWorking capital.â€ù Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.A public stockholder, other than our founding stockholders, will be entitled toreceive funds from the trust account (including interest earned on suchstockholderâ€™s portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable and amountspermitted to be disbursed for working capital purposes) only in the event of ourliquidation of the trust account as part of our liquidation upon our failure tocomplete a business combination, or if such public stockholder converts hisshares of common stock into cash in connection with a business combination thatthe public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate; however,our founding stockholders will not be entitled to receive such funds from thetrust account upon liquidation with respect to any shares of common stock ownedby them immediately before this offering and our founding stockholders will nothave such conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned bythem into a pro rata share of the trust account. In no other circumstances willa public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trustaccount.Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will beentitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to theunderwritersâ€™ deferred discount held in trust excluding any accrued interestthereon, net of the pro rata amount of the underwritersâ€™ deferred discount paidto stockholders who both vote against the business combination and exercisetheir conversion rights. In the event that we are unable to consummate abusiness combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,the underwriters have agreed that the proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™deferred discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the publicstockholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

If the underwritersâ€™ option to purchase additional shares isexercised in full, we estimate we will receive net proceeds of approximately$86.2 million. Of the net proceeds from this offering, we expect to use approximately: â€¢  $30.0 million for sales and marketing initiatives to support the    commercialization of our existing and any future products; and                â€¢  $10.0 million to support our research and development activities, clinical    trials and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.                        We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering forcapital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes. Theamounts actually spent for these purposes may vary significantly and will dependon a number of factors, including our operating costs and other factors. While we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any potential acquisitions, we may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies or products that complement our business. Accordingly, management will retain broad discretion as to the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, we will invest the net proceeds of thisoffering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. We cannotpredict whether the proceeds will yield a favorable return."

Inaddition, as of September 30, 2007, management has incurred approximately$76,515 in reimbursable offering expenses that will be reimbursed by usfollowing completion of this offering for items such as travel, translationcosts, and administrative expenses.(2)      Represents 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the units inthis offering.(3)      Represents 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the units inthis offering that will be paid to the underwriters only upon consummation of abusiness combination, less $0.28 for each share redeemed for cash in connectionwith our business combination. If a business combination is not consummated andwe are liquidated, such amounts will be distributed among our publicstockholders.(4)      These amounts are expected to be paid to legal, accounting and otheroutside professional firms to assist in negotiating, structuring, anddocumenting a business combination and the preparation and filing of the relatedproxy statement.$236,815,000 or $271,555,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option isexercised in full, of net proceeds, including the proceeds of the pre-offeringprivate placement, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bankmaintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, astrustee. Of this amount, $8,400,000 ($9,660,000 if the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters ifand only if a business combination is consummated, less $0.28 for each shareconverted to cash in connection with our business combination. Except as setforth below, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until theearlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. Theproceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any funds held for the benefitof the underwriters or used to pay stockholders who exercised their redemptionrights) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target businesswith which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts not paidas consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to financeoperations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as determinedby our board of directors at that time. Because we do not have any specificbusiness combination under consideration, it is impossible at this time todetermine specifically how we would, following a business combination, use anyproceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate suchbusiness combination. However, we may not use all of the funds remaining in thetrust account in connection with a business combination, either because theconsideration for the business combination is less than the proceeds in thetrust account or because we finance a portion of the consideration with ourcapital stock or debt securities. In that event, the remaining proceeds held inthe trust account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, willconstitute working capital for our business after the business combination andwill be available for use as determined by our board of directors at that time.While it is difficult to determine what the specific operating expenses of ourbusiness after completion of a business combination may be, we expect that theymay include some or all of the following: capital expenditures, general ongoingexpenses including overhead and payroll, costs involved in expanding markets andin developing strategic acquisitions or alliances. In addition, we may use anyremaining proceeds held in the trust account to satisfy any unpaid reimbursableout-of-pocket expenses incurred by our officers and directors in connection withidentifying or completing the business combination, as well as any unpaidfinderâ€™s fees or similar fees or compensation to the extent such expenses, fees,or compensation exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trustaccount.Under the terms of our investment management trust agreement we are permitted,at our discretion, from time to time as interest is earned and funds becomeavailable, to draw the following amounts from the interest accrued on the trustaccount: (i) taxes payable on interest earned, (ii) the amount of any franchisetaxes payable by us, and (iii) up to $3,300,000 to fund our working capital. Theremaining proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust accountuntil the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidationof the trust account as part of any plan of dissolution and liquidation.We have agreed to pay Pacific Millennium, an affiliate of Richard Tan, our ChiefExecutive Officer, $7,500 per month for office space and general andadministrative services including secretarial support. We believe that such feeis at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.Upon completion of a business combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay these monthly fees.We intend to use the excess working capital shown above for director and officerliability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in theevent due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring andnegotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as forreimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existingstockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. Webelieve that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover theforegoing expenses and reimbursement costs.To the extent that our securities are used in whole or in part as considerationto effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account as wellas any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the operations ofthe target business.The SPAC Trust, an affiliate of Richard Tan, loaned us $500,000 pursuant to apromissory note. The proceeds of the loan evidenced by the note are being usedto pay a portion of the expenses related to this offering. The note bears simpleinterest at the rate of 4% per annum with both interest and principal being dueand payable on the earlier of February 26, 2008 or the consummation of thisoffering.The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above, should we choose to holdsuch amounts in a non-cash form, will be invested only in U.S. â€œgovernmentsecurities,â€ù defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the U.S. having a maturityof 180 days or less or money market funds so that we are not deemed to be aninvestment company under the Investment Company Act. Up to $3,300,000 of theinterest income, net of taxes, derived from investment of these net proceedsduring this period may be used to defray our general and administrativeexpenses, as well as to pay costs relating to compliance with securities lawsand regulations, including associated professional fees, until a businesscombination is completed and additional amounts may be used to pay franchisetaxes.We may use a portion of the working capital, including any interest released tous from the trust account, to make a deposit, down payment or fund a â€œno shopâ€ùprovision with respect to a business combination, although we do not have anycurrent intention to do so. If we are ultimately required to forfeit such funds,we would have less funds available to us to conduct due diligence and pay otherexpenses related to finding another suitable business combination withoutborrowing funds. If we were unable to secure additional financing, we would mostlikely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and wouldbe forced to liquidate.We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that abusiness combination is not consummated during that time.Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative fees described above,no compensation will be paid to our executive officer, directors and advisors,or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or inconnection with the consummation of the business combination. However, ourexisting stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expensesincurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such asidentifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitablebusiness combinations and for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection withthis offering. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of thefunds not held in trust and currently allocated in the above table â€œWorkingcapital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance and reserves.â€ù Inaddition, reimbursement for such expenses will also be paid by us out of theinterest on funds held in the trust account and distributable to us eachcalendar month. To the extent that such out-of-pocket expenses exceed theavailable proceeds not deposited in the trust account or other funds availableto us, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless weconsummate a business combination, in which event this reimbursement obligationwould in all likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business. Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a businesscombination. However, although it is our current belief that current managementwill remain associated with us following a business combination, their abilityto do so is not expected to be a factor in determining which businesscombination to pursue.A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account notpreviously released to us) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failureto complete a business combination within the allotted time or if that publicstockholder were to seek to redeem such shares for cash in connection with abusiness combination which the public stockholder voted against and which weactually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder haveany right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

To the extentoffering proceeds remain available after consummation of the merger, LaPorteBancorp intends to contribute 50% of such proceeds to The LaPorte Savings Bank.Depending on the number of shares sold in the offering, The LaPorte Savings Bankwill dividend up to $509,000 to LaPorte Bancorp in order to partially fund themerger consideration. The LaPorte Savings Bank will receive at least 50% of thenet proceeds of the offering following the merger, provided that we may providemore than 50% of such net proceeds to The LaPorte Savings Bank to the extentnecessary so that upon completion of the reorganization and offering, TheLaPorte Savings Bankâ€™s ratio of tangible capital to total assets is at least10%. The LaPorte Savings Bank intends to invest its portion of the proceeds inloan originations and mortgage-backed securities or other qualified investmentsecurities. Initially, LaPorte Bancorp intends to invest the cash proceeds itreceives, following the payment of the cash portion of the merger considerationand the funding of the employee stock ownership plan loan, into short-term,liquid investments, such as United States treasury and government agencysecurities and cash and cash equivalents, in order to supplement the interestincome of The LaPorte Savings Bank and increase consolidated interest income.The actual amounts to be invested in different instruments will depend on theinterest rate environment and LaPorte Bancorpâ€™s and The LaPorte Savings Bankâ€™sliquidity requirements. In the future, LaPorte Bancorp may liquidate itsinvestments and use those funds:â€¢ to pay dividends to shareholders;â€¢ to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory restrictions;                                                             â€¢ to redeem some or all of the trust preferred securities we will assume in   our acquisition of City Savings Financial Corporation when they become      eligible for redemption in 2008, although we have made no firm decision in  this regard;                                                              â€¢ to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions or other      businesses that are related to banking, although no specific transactions   are being considered at this time; and                                    â€¢ for general corporate purposes.Under current regulations, LaPorte Bancorp may not repurchase shares of itscommon stock during the first year following the offering, except to fund equitybenefit plans or, with prior regulatory approval, when extraordinarycircumstances exist."

to our consummation of aninitial business combination.  (2) A portion of the expenses have been or will be paid from advances we receivedfrom Steel Partners, Ltd. as described below. These advances will be repaid nolater than December 31, 2007 out of either the proceeds of the sale of thefounderâ€™s units or the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trustaccount or with interest income earned on the trust account balance. (3) Some of these expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some orall of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates inconnection with negotiating and structuring an initial business combinationbased upon the level of complexity of that initial business combination. We donot anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other thanfluctuations among the categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, tothe extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses,would be deducted from our excess working capital. (4)The amount of underwriting discount and the amount held in the trust accountinclude $16.0 million (or $18.4 million if the over-allotment option isexercised in full) that will be paid to the underwriters upon consummation ofthe initial business combination and will not be available to us. In the eventthat we do not consummate our initial business combination within the requiredtime period, the underwriters will forfeit any right to that amount, which willbe included in the liquidation distribution to our public stockholders. A total of approximately $394,000,000 (or approximately $452,200,000 if theunderwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including$378,000,000 of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of theadditional founderâ€™s warrants (or $433,800,000 if the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option is exercised in full) and $16.0 million (or $18.4 millionif the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferredunderwriting discounts and commissions will be placed in a trust account atJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company astrustee. Except for a portion of the interest income to be released to us (asdescribed in more detail below), the proceeds held in trust will not be releasedfrom the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initialbusiness combination or our liquidation. In the event that we consummate aninitial business combination, all amounts held in the trust account (excludingdeferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $16.0 million (or$18.4 million if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), which will bepaid to the underwriters) that are not (i) paid to public stockholdersexercising their conversion rights or (ii) previously released to us asdescribed below to pay income taxes or as working capital, will be released tous upon the closing of our initial business combination, which must involve oneor more target businesses with a fair market value of at least 80% of the sum ofthe balance in the trust account plus the proceeds of the co-investment at thetime of such business combination. The funds released to us may be used to payall or a portion of the purchase price of our initial business combination. Wemay apply any funds released to us from the trust account not used to pay thepurchase price â€” for example, because we paid all or a portion of the purchaseprice for our initial business combination using stock or debt securities â€” forgeneral corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operationsof an acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest dueon indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, tofund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital. We intend to usethe excess working capital for director and officer liability insurancepremiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating businesscombinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of anyout-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection withactivities on our behalf as described below. Such working capital may includebrokersâ€™ retainer fees, finderâ€™s fees, consulting fees or other similarcompensation and reserves. We have allocated $100,000 of the offering proceeds to fund a portion of ourworking capital. We intend to fund the majority of our working capitalrequirements from a portion of the interest earned on the proceeds being held inthe trust account. Under the terms of the investment management trust agreement,up to $3.5 million of interest may be released to us in such amounts and at suchintervals as we request, subject to availability and to the maximum cap of$3.5 million. Although we do not know the rate of interest to be earned on thetrust account and are unable to predict an exact amount of time it will take tocomplete an initial business combination, we believe that following thecompletion of this offering, it will take some time to find a prospective targetand take all of the steps necessary to complete an initial business combination.We anticipate that, even at an interest rate of 3% per annum, the interest thatwill accrue on the trust account during the time it will take to identify atarget and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our workingcapital requirements. However, if interest payments are not sufficient to fundthese requirements, or are not available to fund the expenses at the time weincur them, we may be required to seek additional capital from third parties. Insuch event, we might seek loans or additional investments from our officers ordirectors or other third parties. However, our officers and directors are underno obligation to advance funds to us or to invest in us. We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performedby some or all of our officers and directors, and Steel Partners Groupprofessionals, and also that it may include engaging market research firms orthird-party consultants. No compensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s andconsulting fees) will be paid to any of our officers or directors, or any of ouror their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection withthe consummation of our initial business combination, including in connectionwith such due diligence activities. However, our officers and directors andSteel Partners Group and its employees will receive reimbursement for anyout-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred by them in connectionwith activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businessesand performing due diligence on a suitable initial business combination, andSteel Partners Ltd. will be entitled to receive payments of an aggregate of$10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services. Ouraudit committee will review and approve all payments made to our officers,directors, Steel Partners Group or our or their affiliates, other than the$10,000 per month payment described above, and any payments made to members ofour audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors,with the interested director or directors abstaining from such review andapproval. In addition, it is also possible that we could use a portion of the funds not inthe trust account to pay finderâ€™s fees, consulting fees or other similarcompensation, or make a deposit, down payment or fund a â€˜â€˜no-shopâ€™â€™ provisionwith respect to a particular proposed initial business combination, although wedo not have any current intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimatelyrequired to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of theagreement relating to such payment or otherwise), if the amount were largeenough and we had already used up the other funds available to us, we could beleft with insufficient funds to continue searching for other potential targetbusinesses or otherwise fund our business. In such case, if we were unable tosecure additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate an initialbusiness combination in the allotted time and be forced to liquidate. We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income of upto $3.5 million earned on the trust account balance that may be released to uswill be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses for which such proceeds havebeen allocated. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligencewill most likely be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letterof intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initialbusiness combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertakingin-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is lessthan the actual amount of such costs, we may be required to raise additionalcapital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currentlyunascertainable. To the extent that such expenses exceed the amounts not held inthe trust account and the interest income of up to $3.5 million that may bereleased to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not bereimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. Since therole of present management after an initial business combination is uncertain,we have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paidto present management after our initial business combination. Our officers anddirectors may, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of someor all of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that have not beenreimbursed prior to the initial business combinationâ€™s closing. If the targetbusinessâ€™s owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our officersand directors to view such potential initial business combination unfavorablyand result in a conflict of interest. As of June 30, 2007, Steel Partners, Ltd. had loaned us a total of $250,000evidenced by a promissory note, which was used to pay a portion of the expensesof this offering referenced in the line items above, including certainorganizational expenses. This note bears interest at 5%, compoundedsemi-annually, is unsecured and is due no later than December 31, 2007. Thisnote will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in thetrust account or with interest income earned on the trust account balance. Thisloan was made to us by Steel Partners, Ltd. because SP Acq LLC was recentlyformed and has limited capital. We have accrued interest of $3,185 on this noteas of June 30, 2007. In addition, as of June 30, 2007, Steel Partners, Ltd.advanced $26,818 to pay expenses that were due before our initial funding. Suchamount will be repaid promptly upon consummation of this offering. SteelPartners, Ltd. regularly advances capital on behalf of various entities in SteelPartners Group. We have agreed to pay Steel Partners, Ltd., an affiliate of SP Acq LLC, a totalof $10,000 per month for office space, administrative services and secretarialsupport. This fee will commence once the proposed offering is completed. Webelieve, based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York area thatthe fee charged by Steel Partners, Ltd. is at least as favorable as we couldhave obtained from an unaffiliated person. In addition, at no additional cost tous, Steel Partners Groupâ€™s offices in New York, Los Angeles and London have morethan 20 employees, including 14 investment and operating professionals, who willbe available to support our operations. Steel Partners Groupâ€™s finance andadministration function which addresses legal, compliance, and operationalmatters will also be available to us. Office space, administrative services andsecretarial support will be shared with other entities in the Steel PartnersGroup as necessary. To the extent that our capital stock or debt financing is used in whole or inpart as consideration to effect our initial business combination, any proceedsheld in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will beused to finance the operations of the combined business. The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only inUnited States â€˜â€˜government securitiesâ€™â€™ (as such term is defined in theInvestment Company Act) and one or more money market funds, selected by us,which invest principally in either short-term securities issued or guaranteed bythe United States having a rating in the highest investment category grantedthereby by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or taxexempt municipal bonds issued by governmental entities located within the UnitedStates, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under theInvestment Company Act. A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust accountonly in the event of our liquidation if we fail to complete our initial businesscombination within the allotted time or if the public stockholder converts suchshares into cash in connection with an initial business combination that thepublic stockholder voted against and that we actually complete. In no othercircumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kindin or to funds in the trust account. The funds a public stockholder will beentitled to receive from the trust account would include interest earned on his,her or its portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable with respect tosuch interest, and less interest income released to us from the trust account inthe manner described above and, in the event of our liquidation for failure toconsummate an initial business combination within the allotted time, interest ofup to $75,000 that may be released to us should we have no or insufficientworking capital to fund the costs and expenses of our dissolution andliquidation. Should there be no such interest available or should those fundsstill not be sufficient, SP Acq LLC has agreed to reimburse us for ourout-of-pocket costs associated with our dissolution and liquidation, excludingany special, indirect or consequential costs, such as litigation, pertaining tothe dissolution and liquidation. On completion of an initial business combination, the underwriters will receivethe deferred underwritersâ€™ discounts and commissions held in the trust account.If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee musttherefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation, theunderwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferredunderwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interestthereon, in the trust account, and (ii) that the trustee is authorized todistribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together withany accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, on apro rata basis to the public stockholders."

We willnot receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the sellingstockholders and Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. will not retain any of the proceedsfrom this offering. Based on the initial public offering price of $15.00 pershare:â€¢   We will use approximately $136.0 million of the net proceeds to us from        this offering to pay Sprint Nextel for limited liability company interests     representing approximately 14.8% of Virgin Mobile USA, LLC (which              consideration will be based on the amount Sprint Nextel would have received    had it converted such limited liability company interests into shares of       our Class A common stock and sold such shares in this offering).           â€¢   Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. will contribute a small part of its interest in        Virgin Mobile USA, LLC to a newly formed entity, VMU GP1, LLC, in exchange     for all of the interests in VMU GP1, LLC.                                  â€¢   We will contribute the remaining net proceeds, along with the majority of      our remaining portion of such limited liability company interests in Virgin    Mobile USA, LLC (once such interests have been converted to limited            partnership interests in the Operating Partnership), to Investments, which     in turn will contribute such proceeds and interests to Holdings.           â€¢   Holdings will use such proceeds to purchase from the Operating Partnership     additional partnership units representing approximately 24.3% of the           Operating Partnership.                                                     â€¢   The Operating Partnership will use the sale proceeds (1) to repay a $150       million portion of the term loan outstanding under our senior secured          credit facility, (2) to repay approximately $45 million of indebtedness        owed to Sprint Nextel under the terms of our subordinated secured revolving    credit facility and (3) for general corporate and other purposes.          Our existing credit agreements consist of (i) a $479 million senior securedcredit facility, which was originally entered into on July 14, 2005 and wasamended and restated on July 19, 2006 and (ii) a $100 million subordinatedsecured revolving credit facility, which was entered into on July 19, 2006 inconnection with the amendment and restatement of the senior secured creditfacility. In connection with this offering, we expect to amend our seniorsecured credit facility and our subordinated secured revolving credit facilityto allow the reorganization transactions and this offering. Following theamendment and the repayment of a $150 million portion of the term loan, the sizeof our senior secured credit facility will be permanently reduced to $329million. In addition, following the repayment of approximately $45 million ofindebtedness owed to Sprint Nextel under the terms of our subordinated securedrevolving credit facility, Sprint Nextel will no longer be a lender under oursubordinated secured revolving credit facility and the Virgin Groupâ€™s commitmentunder the facility will be increased to $75 million. Accordingly, the maximumborrowing amount under the subordinated secured revolving credit facility willbe reduced from $100 million to $75 million following the offering. Under theterms of the senior secured credit facility, the term loan matures onDecember 14, 2010. The borrowings under the senior secured credit facility bearinterest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either(a) an ABR rate determined by reference to higher of (1) the prime rate ofJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (b) aEurodollar rate. Under the terms of the subordinated secured revolving creditfacility, revolving loans mature on the earlier of (a) the date three monthsafter the making of any revolving loan or the rollover of such revolving loan or(b) December 14, 2010. The borrowings under the subordinated secured revolvingcredit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus aEurodollar rate equal to 3-month LIBOR.As of June 30, 2007, we had outstanding borrowings of $442 million under oursenior secured credit facility bearing interest at a rate of 10.31% and $80.0million in borrowings under our subordinated secured revolving credit facilitybearing interest at a weighted average rate of 10.31%. Proceeds from suchborrowings have been used to make distributions to the members of Virgin MobileUSA, LLC and for general corporate purposes, including working capital.Affiliates of Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns are lenders under our seniorsecured credit facility and will receive approximately 9.4% and 11.7%,respectively, of the proceeds to us of this offering."

If theunderwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, then the net proceedswill be approximately $59.9 million.The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, tocreate a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future accessto the public equity markets. We anticipate using the net proceeds from thisoffering:.   to fund internal and external costs in connection with our anticipated NDA     submission for oritavancin in the United States and for other regulatory       filings thereafter in Europe;                                              â€¢   to fund clinical trials for oritavancin in cSSSI using a single    administration, including our SIMPLIFI trial, and to continue the clinical     development of oritavancin for other indications such as bacteremia;       â€¢   to fund commercial launch-related expenses for oritavancin including           manufacturing, marketing, and sales, in anticipation of regulatory approval;                                                                  â€¢   to make regularly scheduled payments on existing debt facilities; andâ€¢   to apply the remaining funds for general corporate purposes and the            potential acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, products, or         companies that complement our business.                                    We have no current understandings, commitments, or agreements with respect toany acquisition of or investment in any technologies, products, or companies.In September 2007, we borrowed $20 million under a term loan facility withMerrill Lynch Capital and two other financial institutions. The loan generallybears interest at a rate per annum equal to 11.14%. We are obligated to makeinterest only payments through January 2008 followed by 36 equal monthlypayments of principal and interest. The loan is secured by a lien on all orsubstantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property. Theproceeds of the loan agreement were used to pay off existing indebtedness of$10.0 million and the remainder will be used for working capital.The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerousfactors, including whether we obtain FDA approval for oritavancin and, if so,the timing of such approval, the success of the commercial launch of oritavancinif approved by the FDA, our cash flows from operations and the anticipatedgrowth of our business. Management will have significant flexibility in applyingthe net proceeds from this offering."

These funds will be repaid out of the net proceeds of thisoffering not being deposited in the trust account upon consummation of thisoffering.(2)Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of thisoffering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments), including 4%, or$1,440,000 to be held in the trust account ($1,656,000 if the underwriter'sover-allotment option is exercised in full), until consummation of a businesscombination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, such deferreddiscount shall be released to the underwriters out of the gross proceeds of thisoffering held in the trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas,maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Theunderwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferreddiscount.(3)A portion of the legal fees payable to Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, our legalcounsel, has been deferred and is contingent on our consummating a businesscombination.(4)The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at$1,300,000 (the initial $100,000 after the offering plus up to $1,200,000 netinterest income from the trust account) even if the over-allotment is exercised.We currently estimate that we would require up to $15,000 should our corporateexistence cease to exist on       , 2009 [24 months from the date of thisprospectus] to liquidate the company in the event we do not consummate abusiness combination. We will be permitted to seek disbursements from the trustaccount of interest income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earnedon the trust account, up to an aggregate of $1,200,000 for working capitalpurposes.Of the net proceeds of this offering, $32,950,000 (or $37,972,000 if theover-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $1,250,000 from the purchase ofinsider warrants, for an aggregate of $34,200,000 (or $39,222,000 if theover-allotment is exercised in full) will be placed in the trust account atDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Additionally, $1,440,000 (or$1,656,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) ofthe proceeds attributable to the underwriters' discount will be deposited intosuch trust account for a total amount in the trust account of $35,640,000 (or$40,878,000 if the over-allotment is exercised in full). The proceeds will notbe released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of abusiness combination or as part of any liquidation of our trust account. To theextent the trust account earns interest or we are deemed to have earned incomein connection therewith, we will be permitted to seek disbursements from thetrust account to pay any federal, state, local or franchise tax obligationsrelated thereto. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used asconsideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisition with which we completea business combination (excluding the amount held in the trust accountrepresenting a portion of the underwriters' discount). Any amounts not paid asconsideration to the sellers of the target business will be used to finance ouroperations, which may include the target business(es) we acquired on theconsummation of the business combination, to effect other acquisitions, or forworking capital, as determined by our board of directors at that time. Allamounts held in the trust account that are not converted to cash or released tous as interest income, net of taxes payable, will be released upon closing ofour initial business combination with a target acquisition having a fair marketvalue of at least 80% of our net assets (net of taxes and amounts disbursed forworking capital purposes and excluding the amount held in the trust accountrepresenting a portion of the underwriter's discount) at the time of suchbusiness combination, subject to a majority of our public stockholders voting infavor of the business combination and less than 30% of the public stockholdersvoting against the business combination and electing their conversion rights.The 30% threshold is 20% in most similar entities. We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $7,500 to Fund Management Group LLC, anaffiliate of our sponsor, for general and administrative services, including butnot limited to receptionist, secretarial and general office services. Thisagreement commences on the date of this prospectus and shall continue until theearliest to occur of: (i) the consummation of a business combination, (ii)       , 2009 [24 months from the date of this prospectus] and (iii) the date onwhich we cease our corporate existence in accordance with our amended andrestated certificate of incorporation.We intend to use the $100,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account,plus $1,200,000 of interest income earned on the trust account, for duediligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition includinginvestment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring andnegotiating business combination, as well as a possible down payment, reversebreak up fees (a provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to thetarget company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up or""no-shop"" provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep targetacquisitions from ""shopping"" around for transactions with other companies onterms more favorable to such target acquisitions), if necessary, to bear thecosts of liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a businesscombination by        , 2009 [24 months from the date of this prospectus]. Whilewe do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or tofund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a particular proposed businesscombination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we paid forthe right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount thatwould be used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision would bedetermined based on the terms of the specific business combination and theamount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whetheras a result of our breach or otherwise) and the exhaustion of the limited recourse line of credit totaling $250,000 and made available to us by our sponsor, could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target acquisitions. In addition to the use of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees toconsultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition. We believethe interest income will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses.To the extent our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or in partas consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event indebtednessfrom third parties is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to effect abusiness combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not usedto consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined companyand will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as workingcapital to finance our operations. In the event third party indebtedness is usedas consideration, our officers and directors would not be personally liable forthe repayment of such indebtedness.We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with abusiness combination, either because the consideration for the businesscombination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we financea portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. Insuch event, the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other netproceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations, which may includethe target business(es) that we acquire on the business combination, to effectother acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board ofdirectors at that time. We may use these funds, among other things, for directorand officer compensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates,to finance the operations of the target acquisition, to make other acquisitionsand to pursue our growth strategy.In the event third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of the expensesof this offering, our sponsor would be liable for the repayment of suchindebtedness. Our sponsor has advanced to us a total of $100,000, which was usedto pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line itemsabove for SEC registration fees, NASD registration fees, blue sky filing feesand legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without intereston the earlier of April 1, 2008, or the consummation of this offering. The loanwill be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not held in trust.The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trust accountagent only in United States ""government securities"" within the meaning ofSection 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Although the rate ofinterest to be earned on the trust account will fluctuate through the durationof the trust account, and although we are unable to state the exact amount oftime it will take to complete a business combination, we anticipate the interestthat will accrue on the trust account, even at an interest rate of 4% (up to$1,200,000 interest income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earnedon the trust account), during the time it will take to identify a target andcomplete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capitalrequirements. While we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this rate,we believe such rate is representative of that which we may receive. Byrestricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend toavoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940. Notwithstanding our belief we are not required to complywith the requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distribute thetrust account to holders of our common stock sold in this offering until afterour existence terminates by operation of law on         , 2009 [24 months fromthe date of this prospectus] and, consequently, we may be deemed to be aninvestment company and thus required to comply with such act. The interestincome derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period that isnot otherwise returned to public stockholders who vote against a businesscombination will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, aswell as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,including associated professional fees, until a business combination iscompleted. We believe upon consummation of this offering, we will havesufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuminga business combination is not consummated during that time.We do not believe the fees and expenses for due diligence, legal, accounting,acquisition, down payment, lock-up or other activities related to this offeringor our business combination will exceed $1,300,000 in the aggregate, comprisedof $100,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account plus up to $1,200,000of net interest income. Based upon the experience of the members of our boardand consultation with them regarding a reasonable budget for consummating atransaction of this kind and nature, and a review of budgets publicly disclosedby blank check companies, we determined this was an appropriate approximation ofthe expenses. If costs are higher than expected we might not have sufficientfunds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, anypotential target acquisitions. In such case, we would need to obtain additional funds from our initial stockholders or another source to continue operations. Further, wemay seek to acquire a target business with a fair market value significantly inexcess of 80% of our net assets held in the trust account. In order to do so, wemay seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equitysecurities, and the Company may effect a business combination using the proceedsof such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In thecase of a business combination funded with assets other than the trust accountassets, the proxy materials disclosing the business combination for which wewould seek stockholder approval would disclose the terms of the financing aswell and, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing as a separateproposal in the proxy materials in addition to, and contingent upon, stockholderapproval of the proposed business combination. In the absence of a requirementby law or regulation, we would not seek separate stockholder approval of suchfinancing inasmuch as the financing portion of any business combination would bedisclosed in the proxy materials and would be a consideration of the stockholderapproval process for the business combination under consideration. There are noprohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans that wouldallow us to acquire a company with a fair market value in an amount greater than80% of the net assets held in the trust account at the time of the acquisition.At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with anythird party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale ofsecurities or otherwise.We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $7,500 to Fund Management Group LLC, anaffiliate of our sponsor, for general and administrative services, including butnot limited to receptionist, secretarial and general office services. Thisagreement commences on the date of this prospectus and shall continue until theearliest to occur of: (i) the consummation of a business combination, (ii)       , 2009 [24 months from the date of this prospectus] and (iii) the date onwhich we cease our corporate existence in accordance with our amended andrestated certificate of incorporation. The only obligation for space as of thedate of prospectus is with Fund Management Group LLC. No compensation of anykind (including finders, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to anyof our existing officers, directors or stockholders, or any of their affiliates,prior to, or for any services that they render in order to effectuate, or inconnection with the consummation of the business combination. However, suchpersons will receive reimbursement, subject to board approval, for anyout-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on ourbehalf, such as identifying potential target acquisitions, performing businessdue diligence on suitable target acquisitions and business combinations, as wellas traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospectivetarget acquisitions to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenseswill be paid by us out of the funds not held in the trust account and currentlyallocated in the above table to ""Legal, accounting and other expenses,"" ""Duediligence of prospective target acquisitions"" and ""Working capital."" Since therole of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have noability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those personsafter a business combination.A public stockholder (but not our existing stockholders with respect to anyshares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering orunderlying the insider warrants purchased in the private placement) will beentitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned onsuch stockholder's portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable andamounts disbursed for working capital purposes) only in the event of ourliquidation of the trust account as part of our liquidation upon our failure tocomplete a business combination, or if such public stockholder converts hisshares of common stock into cash in connection with a business combination thatthe public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In noother circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of anykind to or in the trust account. Existing stockholders, directors and officersare not entitled to convert any of their shares of common stock acquired priorto this offering, in this offering or after this offering into a pro rata shareof the trust account.Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will beentitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to theunderwriters' discount held in the trust account excluding any accrued interestthereon. In the event we are unable to consummate a business combination and thetrustee is forced to liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed:(i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and any accruedinterest thereon; and (ii) the proceeds attributable to the underwriters'discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public stockholdersalong with any accrued interest thereon."

This loan will be repaid upon consummation of this offering out     of the proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account. (2)Âº The underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $15.1 million of their     underwriting commissions (or approximately $17.4 million if the     over-allotment option is exercised in full), which equals 3.15% of the     gross proceeds of this offering, until consummation of initial business     combination. Upon consummation of our initial business combination,     approximately $15.1 million, which constitutes the underwriters' deferred     commissions (or approximately $17.4 million if the underwriters' over     allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters     from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be     released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase     price of the business or businesses with which our initial business     combination occurs, general corporate purposes, payment of principal or     interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business     combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working     capital.    A total of approximately $466.9 million (or approximately $536.1 million ifthe underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), of the netproceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described inthis prospectus, including approximately $15.1 million (or approximately$17.4 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full)of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account at J.P.Morgan Chase, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trusteeand will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions underRule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for a portion of the interestincome that may be released to us, the proceeds held in trust will not bereleased from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of ourinitial business combination or our liquidation.    Commencing on the closing of this offering, we have agreed to pay HicksHoldings Operating, an entity owned and controlled by Thomas O. Hicks, ourfounder and chairman of the board, a total of $10,000 per month for officespace, administrative services and secretarial support. This arrangement isbeing agreed to by Mr. Hicks for our benefit and is not intended to provideMr. Hicks compensation in lieu of salary or other remuneration because it isanticipated that the expenses to be paid by Mr. Hicks will approximate themonthly reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as wecould have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our initialbusiness combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthlyfees.    We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income ofup to $5.7 million, subject to adjustment, earned on the trust account balance(net of taxes payable) that may be released to us will be sufficient to pay thecosts and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based onthe fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target businessin connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depthdue diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospectiveacquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent orother preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence andnegotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary todo so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availabilityand cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seeksuch additional capital through loans or additional investments from members ofour management team, but such members of our management team are not under anyobligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. To the extent that theunderwriters exercise their over-allotment option, the maximum amount ofinterest income we may withdraw from the trust account will proportionatelyincrease up to approximately $6.6 million. We will use such proportionateincrease in interest income to cover our working capital expenses. While wecurrently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and whilethey will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, webelieve that any additional interest income released to us would facilitate ourability to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater number ofpotential acquisition targets.    As of the date of this prospectus, Mr. Hicks, our founder and chairman ofthe board, has advanced to us a total of $225,000 to be used for a portion ofthe expenses of this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing,unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2007 or the closing of thisoffering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not beingplaced in the trust account.    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested by thetrustee only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days orless or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 underthe Investment Company Act. Because the investment of the proceeds will berestricted to these instruments, we believe we will meet the requirements forthe exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the U.S. InvestmentCompany Act of 1940. Interest income of up to $5.7 million, subject toadjustment, on the trust account balance (net of taxes payable) may be releasedto us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working capitalrequirements."

We currently intendto use net proceeds from this offering for research and development, sales andmarketing, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. We do not haveagreements or commitments for any specific material acquisitions at this time.While our board of directors has approved opening negotiations to purchase acertain technology relating to CA systems security, negotiations have not yetbeen initiated and, if and when commenced, may not lead to an agreement ondefinitive terms for or the consummation of any acquisition. We have made anaggregate capital contribution of $4.5 million to Super TV since itsestablishment in 2004 and we currently have no plans to make any additionalcapital contributions.To the extent that the net proceeds from this offering are not immediatelyapplied for the above purposes, we intend to invest the net proceeds inshort-term interest-bearing debt instruments or bank deposits. These investmentsmay have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequencesof your investment in our ADSs. In particular, it is possible that we may becomea passive foreign investment company for United States federal income taxpurposes, which could result in negative tax consequences for you."

If the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full, weestimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $62.1 million.The principal purposes for this offering are to fund our development activities,including clinical trials for our internal development programs primarilyrelated to our most advanced product candidates UDB and MAP0004, to increase ourworking capital, to create a public market for our common stock, to increase ourability to access the capital markets in the future, for general corporatepurposes and to provide liquidity for our existing stockholders. We may spend aportion of the net proceeds on sales and marketing activities, general andadministrative matters and on capital expenditures.We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the potential acquisition of, orinvestment in, technologies, products or companies that complement our business,although we have no current understandings, commitments or agreements to do so.The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our currentintentions based upon our present plan and business conditions. As of the dateof this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular usesfor the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering.Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in the application of the netproceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding theapplication of the proceeds of this offering.The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerousfactors, including the progress in, and costs of, our clinical developmentprograms, especially UDB and MAP0004, and the amount and timing of revenues, ifany, from any future collaborations.Until we use the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the netproceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by theselling stockholders. We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering for general corporatepurposes, including financing our growth, developing new products, acquiring newcustomers, funding capital expenditures, and potentially acquisitions andinvestments. We also intend to use a portion of our net proceeds to repay all ofthe outstanding debt under our term loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank. Asof June 30, 2007, we had $3.1 million outstanding under the term loan facility.Under the terms of the facility, each advance we draw under the facility bearsinterest at the prime rate plus 2% but may be decreased to the prime rate plus1.5% upon the occurrence of certain profitability events. Each advance ispayable in monthly installments over three years from the date of the advance.The advances may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. AtJune 30, 2007, the interest rate was 10.25%. In addition, the other principal purposes for this offering are to: â€¢    create a public market for our common stock;                               â€¢    facilitate our future access to the public capital markets;                â€¢    increase our visibility in our markets;                                    â€¢    provide liquidity for our existing stockholders;                           â€¢    improve the effectiveness of our equity compensation plans in attracting       and retaining key employees; and                                           â€¢    enhance our ability to acquire other businesses, products or technologies. We have not yet determined with any certainty the manner in which we willallocate our net proceeds. Management will retain broad discretion in theallocation and use of our net proceeds from this offering. The amounts andtiming of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors,including the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive andtechnological developments, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Forexample, if we were to expand our operations more rapidly than anticipated byour current plans, a greater portion of our proceeds would likely be used forthe construction and expansion of facilities, working capital and other capitalexpenditures. Alternatively, if we were to engage in an acquisition thatcontained a significant cash component, some or all of our proceeds might beused for that purpose. Although we may use a portion of our proceeds for the acquisition of, orinvestment in, businesses, technologies, products or assets that complement ourbusiness, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enterinto any acquisitions or make any investments. Pending specific utilization of our net proceeds as described above, we intendto invest our net proceeds of the offering in short-term investment grade andU.S. government securities."

We intend to retain at Beacon Federal Bancorp, Inc. between $ 34.1million and $ 46.4 million of the net proceeds, or $ 53.4 million if theoffering range is increased by 15%, to be used for the purposes described below.     A summary of the anticipated net proceeds at the minimum, midpoint, maximumand adjusted maximum of the offering range and the use of the net proceeds is asfollows:                                                         Based Upon the Sale at $10.00 Per Share of                                                           ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                              7,012,500 Shares          8,250,000 Shares          9,487,500 Shares          10,910,625 Shares (1)                               -----------------------   -----------------------   -----------------------   ----------------------------                                         Percent                   Percent                   Percent                        Percent                                           of Net                    of Net                    of Net                        of Net                               Amount      Proceeds      Amount      Proceeds      Amount      Proceeds       Amount         Proceeds                             -- -------   -- -------   -- -------   -- -------   -- -------   -- -------   -- ----------    --- -------                                                                     (Dollars in thousands)                                            Stock offering                                                                                                                      proceeds                 $   70,125                $   82,500                $   94,875                $     109,106                 Less offering expenses       (1,994 )                  (2,085 )                  (2,176 )                     (2,281 )                                        -- -------                -- -------                -- -------                -- ----------                 Net offering proceeds    $   68,131        100.0 % $   80,415        100.0 % $   92,699        100.0 % $     106,825          100.0 %                         -- -------   -- -------   -- -------   -- -------   -- -------   -- -------   -- ----------    --- -------  Use of net proceeds:                                                                                                                 To Beacon Federal        $   34,066         50.0 % $   40,208         50.0 % $   46,350         50.0 % $      53,413           50.0 %To fund loan to                                                                                                                     employee stock                                                                                                                      ownership plan                5,610          8.2        6,600          8.2        7,590          8.2           8,729            8.2                           -- -------                -- -------                -- -------                -- ----------                 Retained by Beacon                                                                                                                  Federal Bancorp, Inc.    $   28,456         41.8 % $   33,608         41.8 % $   38,760         41.8 % $      44,684           41.8 %                         -- -------                -- -------                -- -------                -- ----------                 (1)  As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares, which         could occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand        for the shares, changes in market or general financial conditions following      the commencement of the offering, or regulatory considerations.                  Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existingdeposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment butwill result in a reduction of Beacon Federalâ€™s deposits.  The net proceeds mayvary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be more or lessthan our estimates.  For example, our expenses would increase if a syndicatedcommunity offering were used to sell shares of common stock not purchased in thesubscription and community offerings. Beacon Federal Bancorp, Inc. May Use the Proceeds it Retains from the Offering:â€¢ to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares of   common stock in the offering (between $5.6 million and $7.6 million, or $8.7   million if the offering is increased by 15%);                   â€¢ to invest in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage    obligations, and debt securities issued by the United States Government and   United States Government-sponsored agencies or entities;                                                                                              â€¢ to finance the acquisition of financial institutions, branches or other   financial service companies;                                                                                                                              â€¢ to pay cash dividends to stockholders;                                                                                                                    â€¢ to repurchase shares of our common stock; and                                                                                                             â€¢ for other general corporate purposes.                                        However, with the exception of the funding of the loan to the employeestock ownership plan, Beacon Federal Bancorp, Inc. has not quantified its plansfor use of the offering proceeds for each of the foregoing purposes. Initially,we intend to invest a substantial portion of the net proceeds in short-terminvestments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities.     Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may notrepurchase shares of our common stock during the first year following theconversion, except to fund equity benefit plans other than stock options orexcept when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatoryapproval.  Beacon Federal May Use the Net Proceeds it Receives from the Offering:â€¢ to expand its retail and commercial banking franchise by acquiring or     establishing new branches, or by acquiring other financial institutions or   other financial services companies;                                                                                                                    â€¢ to fund new loans, including one- to four-family residential mortgage loans,   commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity and other   consumer loans and lines of credit;                                                                                                                 â€¢ to enhance existing products and services and to support new products and   services;                                                                                                                                             â€¢ to reduce a portion of our existing borrowings;                                                                                                           â€¢ to invest in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage       obligations, and debt securities issued by the United States Government and   United States Government-sponsored agencies or entities; and                                                                                          â€¢ for other general corporate purposes.                                   However, Beacon Federal has not quantified its plans for use of the offeringproceeds for each of the foregoing purposes. Our short-term and long-term growthplans anticipate that, upon completion of the offering, we will experiencegrowth through increased lending and investment activities and, possibly,acquisitions. We plan to explore acquisition opportunities involving otherbanks, thrifts and credit unions, and possibly financial services companies as ameans of supplementing our internal growth. We currently have no understandingsor agreements to acquire other banks, thrifts, credit unions or financialservices companies.

If a business combination is not        consummated and we are liquidated, such amounts will be distributed among         our public stockholders.                                                      (4) A portion of the legal fees payable to Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, our        legal counsel, may be deferred and is contingent on our consummating a            business combination.                                                         (5) Approximately $25,000 in additional accounting fees may be due in connection      with the initial public offering, which such additional fees shall be paid,       if at all, from our working capital.                                          (6) These amounts are expected to be paid to legal, accounting and other outside      professional firms to assist in negotiating, structuring and documenting a        business combination and the preparation and filing of the related proxy          statement.                                                                  $49,500,000, or $56,700,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option isexercised in full, of the proceeds of the offering and the private placementwill be placed in a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained byContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. Of this amount, up to$1,500,000 ($1,725,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercisedin full) will be paid to Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc. as deferred underwritingcompensation in connection with this offering, if and only if a businesscombination is consummated, leaving us with $48,000,000 ($54,975,000 if theover-allotment option is exercised in full) with which to consummate a businesscombination. Other than interest income earned on the trust account, which maybe released to us as described in the table above, the proceeds of this offeringand the private placement held in the trust account will not be released untilthe earlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidation ofour trust account to our public stockholders as part of our plan of dissolutionand liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any fundsheld for the benefit of the Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc., or used to pay publicstockholders who have exercised their redemption rights) may be used asconsideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimatelycomplete a business combination or, if there are insufficient funds not held intrust, to pay other expenses relating to such transaction such as reimbursementto insiders for out-of-pocket expenses, third party due diligence expenses orpotential finders fees, in each case only upon the consummation of a businesscombination. In the event there are funds remaining in the trust account aftersatisfaction of all of such obligations, such funds may be used to financeoperations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as determinedby our board of directors at that time.We intend to fund our working capital needs as described below, as well as topay the costs associated with our plan of dissolution and liquidation includingreserves for creditors, if we do not consummate a business combination, from the$900,000 held outside of the trust account and up to $600,000 of interest earnedon the proceeds being held in the trust account (after taxes payable) which maybe released to us.We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $7,500 to Camden Partners Holdings, LLC,our sponsor, for general and administrative services, including but not limitedto receptionist, secretarial and general office services. This agreementcommences on the date of this prospectus and shall continue until the earliestto occur of: (i) the consummation of a business combination, (ii) November 29,2009 and (iii) the date on which we cease our corporate existence in accordancewith our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.Prior to the closing of a business combination, we have agreed to obtain key manlife insurance, of which we will be the sole beneficiary, in the amount of$2,000,000 on the life of David L. Warnock, our President, Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Chairman, for a three year period.We estimate the costs to identify and research prospective target businesses andthe costs related to the business combination, including legal and accountingexpenses to structure the transaction, prepare the transaction documents andfile the related proxy statement, will be approximately $400,000.We expect due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed bysome or all of our officers and directors, and may include engaging marketresearch firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors willnot receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective targetbusinesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such astravel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities.It is also possible we could use a portion of such working capital to make adeposit, down payment or fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respect to a particularproposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention todo so. In the event we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whetheras a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment orotherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital availableoutside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other expensesrelated to finding another suitable business combination without securingadditional financing. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, wewould most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted timeand would be forced to liquidate.We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a businesscombination, either because the consideration for the business combination isless than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of theconsideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event, theproceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds notexpended will be released to us and used to finance the operations of the targetbusinesses, which may include subsequent acquisitions.As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us a total of$200,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering, suchas SEC registration fees, FINRA registration fees, blue sky fees and certainlegal and accounting fees and expenses. This loan is payable, with annualinterest equal to 4.9%, on the earlier of April 26, 2008 or the consummation ofthis offering. The loan will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offeringnot being placed in trust.The net proceeds of this offering and the private placement held in the trustaccount and not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will beinvested only in United States â€œgovernment securities,â€ù defined as any TreasuryBill issued by the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eightydays or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7promulgated under the 1940 Act so that we are not deemed to be an investmentcompany under the 1940 Act.Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month general and administrative servicefees described above, no compensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s andconsulting fees) will be paid by us or any person or entity to any of ourexisting stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to usprior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination.However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for anyout-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on ourbehalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing duediligence on suitable business combinations. Because the role of presentmanagement after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability todetermine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after abusiness combination.A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, butnet of: (i) taxes paid or payable, if any, on interest income earned on thetrust account and (ii) up to an aggregate of $600,000 of interest incomereleased to us to fund our working capital requirements) in the event of theliquidation of our trust account to our public stockholders or in the event apublic stockholder were to seek to redeem such shares for cash in connectionwith a business combination which the public stockholder voted against and whichwe actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder haveany right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

over-allotments) including 3%,        or $9,000,000, to be held in trust ($10,350,000 if the underwritersâ€™              over-allotment option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business      combination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, such deferred       discount shall be released to the underwriters out of the gross proceeds of       this offering held in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,               maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.       The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the              deferred discount.                                                           (3)   Includes the repayment of the principal amount of the $139,025 promissory         note issued by us to our sponsor in consideration of our sponsorâ€™s                advancement of expenses in connection with this offering, plus accrued and        unpaid interest to the date of repayment. The note accrues interest at a          rate of 5% per annum.                                                          (4)   Includes $9,000,000 representing the underwritersâ€™ contingent underwriting        discount to be held in trust until the consummation of a business                 combination.                                                                   (5)   $50,000 of the proceeds of this offering will be held outside of the trust        account and available to us to fund our working capital requirements. In          addition, the interest earned on the trust account, net of taxes payable on       such interest, will be released to us to cover our working capital                requirements, up to a maximum of $4,100,000.                                 We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units and the insiderwarrants to acquire one or more businesses in the global consumer products andservices industry. Of the net proceeds of this offering, $277,950,000 (or $319,800,000 if theover-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $8,500,000 from the purchase ofinsider warrants, for an aggregate of $286,450,000 (or $328,300,000 if theover-allotment is exercised in full) will be placed in a trust account atJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Additionally, $9,000,000 (or$10,350,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full) ofthe proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™ discount will be deposited intosuch trust account for a total amount in trust of $295,450,000 (or $338,650,000if the over-allotment is exercised in full). The proceeds will not be releasedfrom the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a businesscombination or as part of any liquidation of our trust account. To the extentthe trust account earns interest or we are deemed to have earned income inconnection therewith, we will be permitted to seek disbursements from the trustaccount to pay any federal, state or local tax obligations related thereto orany franchise tax obligations. The proceeds held in the trust account may beused as consideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisition with which wecomplete a business combination (excluding the amount held in the trust accountrepresenting a portion of the underwritersâ€™ discount and any amount reserved forpayment of taxes and/or working capital purposes). Any amounts not paid asconsideration to the sellers of the target business will be used to finance ouroperations, which may include the target business(es) we acquired on theconsummation of the business combination, to effect other acquisitions, or forworking capital, as determined by our board of directors at that time. Allamounts held in the trust account that are not converted to cash or released tous as interest income, net of income taxes, will be released on closing of ourinitial business combination with a target acquisition having a fair marketvalue of at least 80% of the amount (excluding the amount held in the trustaccount representing a portion of the underwritersâ€™ discount and any amountreserved for payment of taxes and/or working capital purposes) at the time ofsuch business combination, subject to a majority of our public stockholdersvoting in favor of the business combination and less than 30% of the publicstockholders voting against the business combination and electing theirconversion rights. We believe that prior to the consummation of a business combination, the $50,000of proceeds initially held outside of the trust account, as well as the interestearned on the trust account, net of taxes payable on such interest, up to amaximum of $4,100,000, will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses forthe 24 months subsequent to the consummation of this offering and to cover theexpenses incurred in connection with a business combination.Assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time, weanticipate making the following expenditures during this time period:     â€¢  approximately $2,460,000 of expenses for legal, accounting and other              expenses attendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring and           negotiating of a business combination, including without limitation               third-party fees for assisting us in performing due diligence                     investigations of prospective target businesses;                                  â€¢  approximately $500,000 of expenses in legal and accounting fees relating to       our SEC reporting obligations (including the proxy statement in connection        with a business combination);                                                     â€¢  approximately $240,000 of expenses in fees relating to our services               agreement with our sponsor and certain general and administrative services;       â€¢  approximately $950,000 for general working capital that will be used for          miscellaneous expenses, including reimbursement of any out-of-pocket              expenses incurred by our founding stockholders, directors and officers in         connection with activities on our behalf, director and officer liability          and other insurance premiums and, if we must dissolve and liquidate, up to        approximately $75,000 for dissolution and liquidation costs.                These amounts are based on managementâ€™s estimate of the amount needed to fundour operations for the 24 months subsequent to the consummation of this offeringand to consummate a business combination. This estimate may prove inaccurate,especially if a portion of the available funds is used to make a down payment orpay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business combination or ifwe expend a significant portion of the available funds in pursuit of a businesscombination that is not consummated. While we cannot assure you the balance ofthe trust account will be invested to yield these rates, we believe such ratesare representative of those we may receive on the balance of the trust account.If we do not have sufficient funds available to cover our expenses, we may beforced to obtain additional financing, either from our existing stockholders,directors and officers or third parties. We may not be able to obtain additionalfinancing and our existing stockholders, directors and officers are notobligated to provide any additional financing. If we do not have sufficientfunds and cannot find additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate priorto consummating a business combination. If we choose to obtain additionalfinancing in order to fund due diligence and other expenses associated withlocating a target business, and if such additional financing were in the form ofa loan, such loan would be incurred by us. To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or inpart as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event thatindebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as considerationto effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account whichare not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to thecombined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, beused as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third-partyindebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors would not bepersonally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness. We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a businesscombination, either because the consideration for the business combination isless than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of theconsideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event, theproceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds notexpended will be used to finance our operations, which may include the targetbusiness(es) that we acquire on the business combination, to effect otheracquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board of directors atthat time. We may use these funds, among other things, for director and officercompensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to financethe operations of the target acquisition, to make other acquisitions and topursue our growth strategy.The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for thepurposes set forth above will be invested only in U.S. â€œgovernment securities,â€ùdefined as any Treasury Bill issued by the U.S. government having a maturity of180 days or less, or any open-ended investment company registered under the 1940Act that holds itself out as a registered money market fund and bears thehighest credit rating issued by a U.S. nationally recognized rating agency. Byrestricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend tomeet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated underthe 1940 Act so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the1940 Act. The interest income earned on investment of the net proceeds not heldin trust during this period, net of taxes payable on such interest, as well asthe interest earned on the trust account, net of taxes payable on such interest,up to a maximum of $4,100,000, will be used to defray our general andadministrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securitieslaws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a businesscombination is completed. We do not expect to pay any of our founding stockholders, directors or officersor any entity with which they are affiliated, any finderâ€™s fee for servicesrendered to us prior to or in connection with a business combination. However,our founding stockholders, directors and officers will receive reimbursement forany reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with ourorganization, this offering and activities on our behalf, such as participatingin the offering process, identifying a potential target operating business andperforming due diligence on a suitable business combination. We have notreserved any specific amount for such payments, which may have the effect ofreducing the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for paymentof our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred onour behalf. In addition, since the role of present management after a businesscombination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, ifany, will be paid to those persons for periods after a business combination. A public stockholder (but not our founding stockholders with respect to theirfounder shares and shares of common stock underlying any insider warrantsacquired by a founding stockholder immediately prior to this offering) will beentitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned onsuch stockholderâ€™s portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable andamounts disbursed for working capital purposes) only in the event of ourliquidation of the trust account as part of our liquidation upon our failure tocomplete a business combination, or if such public stockholder converts his, heror its shares of common stock into cash in connection with a businesscombination that the public stockholder voted against and which we actuallyconsummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any rightor interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Founding stockholders arenot entitled to convert any of their founder shares (or shares of common stockunderlying any insider warrants acquired by a founding stockholder immediatelyprior to this offering) or shares acquired in or after this offering into a prorata share of the trust account. However, founding stockholders who acquireshares of common stock or warrants in or after this offering will be entitled toa pro rata share of the trust account with respect to such shares of commonstock (including shares acquired upon exercise of such warrants) upon theliquidation of the trust account if we fail to consummate a business combinationwithin the required time period. Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will beentitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to theunderwritersâ€™ discount held in trust excluding any accrued interest thereon. Inthe event that we are unable to consummate a business combination and thetrustee is forced to liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreedthat: (i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and anyaccrued interest thereon; and (ii) the proceeds attributable to theunderwritersâ€™ discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the publicstockholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are            reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of          this offering. An additional $2,730,000, or $3,150,000 if the over-allotment      option is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in trust              following the consummation of this offering, is payable to the underwriters       only if and when we consummate a business combination.                         (2)   The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain       constant at $250,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition,        there can be released to us from the trust account, interest earned on the      funds in the trust account, net of taxes payable on such interest, (i) up      to an aggregate of $1,700,000 to fund our expenses related to       investigating and selecting a target business and our other working            capital requirements and (ii) to pay any amounts we may need to pay our           income or other tax obligations. For purposes of presentation, the full           amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds               available to us immediately following this offering.                           (3)   The miscellaneous expenses may include deposits or down payments for a            proposed initial business combination, director and officer liability             insurance premiums, brokersâ€™ retainer fees, consulting fees, findersâ€™ fees        and fees payable to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.             In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our initialstockholders have agreed to purchase warrants exercisable for 2,400,000 sharesof our common stock at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant in a privateplacement that will occur simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of theinsider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from the sale of the insiderwarrants will be placed in the trust account described below. $76,415,000, or $87,995,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,of the net proceeds of this offering, plus the $2,400,000 we will receive fromthe sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorganChase Bank, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting astrustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts andcommissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters haveagreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate abusiness combination and have waived their right to receive such payment uponour liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The fundsheld in trust will be invested only in United States â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ùwithin the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certainconditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the InvestmentCompany Act. Except with respect to interest income that may be released to usfrom time to time (i) of up to $1,700,000 to fund our expenses related toinvestigating and selecting a target business and our other working capitalrequirements and (ii) to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceedsheld in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier ofthe completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds heldin the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a targetbusiness with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid asconsideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to financeoperations of the target business. We have agreed to pay Clarity Partners, L.P., or Clarity, a monthly fee of$7,500 for office space and administrative and support services. Barry A.Porter, one of our special advisors, is a co-founder and Managing GeneralPartner of Clarity, and the grantor trust of Mr. Porter, Nautilus Trust dtd9/10/99, is one of our initial stockholders. This arrangement is being agreed toby Clarity for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Porter, any memberof our management team, any other special advisor or any of our directors withcompensation in lieu of a salary or other remuneration. We believe, based onrents and fees for similar services in the Beverly Hills, California area, thatthe fee charged by Clarity is at least as favorable as we could have obtainedfrom any unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion ofa business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our publicstockholders. No compensation of any kind, including finderâ€™s, consulting or other similarfees, will be paid to any of our initial stockholders, officers, directors orspecial advisors, or any of their affiliates, for any services rendered prior toor in connection with the consummation of a business combination, other than themonthly fee of $7,500 for office space and administrative and support servicesreferred to above, a potential finderâ€™s or success fee to Ladenburg Thalmann &Co. Inc., an affiliate of Dr. Frost, our Chairman of the Board, to the extent weenter into an agreement with such company in connection with our search for atarget business, and repayment of non-interest bearing loans of $200,000 in theaggregate made by certain of our initial stockholders. However, such individualswill receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them inconnection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential targetbusinesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses andbusiness combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants orsimilar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.Our audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements made to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates, and any reimbursements made to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with any interested director abstaining fromsuch review and approval. Such review will encompass an analysis of the corporate purposes advanced by such expenses and their reasonableness as compared to similar services or products that could have been procured from an independent third party source. There is no limit on the total amount of these out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us, and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses other than by our audit committee and, in some cases, by our board of directors as described above, or if such reimbursement is challenged, by a court of competent jurisdiction. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust. To the extent such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available funds not held in trust and the interest income that may be released to us as described above, such out-of-pocket expenses will not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination. Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, ifany, will be paid to those persons after a business combination. Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the netproceeds from this offering and the private placement available to us out oftrust for our search for a business combination will be approximately $250,000.In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the trust account, net oftaxes payable on such interest, of up to $1,700,000 may be released to us fromtime to time upon our request to fund our expenses relating to investigating andselecting a target business and other working capital requirements. We intend touse these funds for director and officer liability insurance premiums, duediligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiatingbusiness combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocketexpenses incurred by our initial stockholders in connection with activities onour behalf as described above. We will also be entitled to have interest earnedon the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any tax obligationsthat we may owe. We believe that these funds will be sufficient to allow us tooperate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is notconsummated during that time. However, we cannot assure you that our estimateswill be accurate. We may request the release of such funds for a number ofpurposes that may not ultimately lead to a business combination. For instance,we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultantsto assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portionof the funds as a down payment with respect to a particular proposed businesscombination, or enter into a letter of intent where we pay for the right toreceive exclusivity from a target business, where we may be required to forfeitfunds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise). In any of these cases,or in other situations where we expend the funds available to us outside of thetrust account for purposes that do not result in a business combination, we maynot have sufficient remaining funds to continue searching for, or to conduct duediligence with respect to, a target business, in which case we would be forcedto obtain alternative financing or liquidate. The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash orcash equivalents or will be invested only in United States â€œgovernmentsecuritiesâ€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Actof 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meetingcertain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Actof 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under theInvestment Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceedsduring this period will be used to defray our general and administrativeexpenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws andregulations, including associated professional fees, until a businesscombination is completed. The allocation of net proceeds not held in trust and amounts available from theinterest income earned on the trust account represents our best estimate of theintended uses of these funds. We do not expect to use such amounts for anythingother than the purposes stated above. However, management may be required to paya different amount than the amount indicated in the table above for legal,accounting and other expenses attendant to the due diligence investigation,structuring and negotiation of a business combination, depending upon the levelof complexity of such business combination. The difference, if any, will beallocated to, or deducted from, our working capital.We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business andto pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock isused in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, theproceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a businesscombination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with anyother net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance theoperations of the acquired business or businesses. Such working capital fundscould be used in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, formaintenance or expansion of the operations of an acquired business orbusinesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred inconsummating our business combination, to fund strategic acquisitions and formarketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such fundscould also be used to repay any operating expenses or findersâ€™ fees which we hadincurred prior to the completion of our business combination if the fundsavailable to us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover suchexpenses. To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will paythe costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.If such funds are insufficient, our initial stockholders have agreed to advanceus the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to beno more than approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of suchexpenses. Frost Gamma Investments Trust, Robert N. Fried, Rao Uppaluri, Steven D. Rubinand Jane Hsiao have agreed to loan a total of $200,000 to us for the payment ofoffering expenses. The loans bear no interest and are due on the earlier ofJune 12, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid outof the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offeringexpenses. A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account,including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, onlyin the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts suchshares into cash in connection with a business combination which the publicstockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstanceswill a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in thetrust account."

If the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceedswill be approximately $104.8 million. We will not receive any proceeds from thesale of shares by the selling stockholders. The principal purposes of this offering are to increase public awareness of ourcompany and improve our competitive position, obtain additional capital, createa public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to thepublic equity markets. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to repayin full the principal and accrued interest on our outstanding indebtedness,which was approximately $20.7 million as of September 30, 2007 and bore interestat a rate of 8.0% per annum, together with related prepayment fees ofapproximately $0.3 million. The loan plus accrued interest is due and payable onJune 1, 2010. We expect to use our remaining net proceeds from this offering forgeneral corporate purposes and working capital, including potential investmentsin technologies, applications, software or assets, and acquisition of companiesthat complement our business. We used the proceeds of the $20.0 million borrowedunder the loan and security agreement to provide us with working capital. We have no present negotiations or current agreements or commitments withrespect to any material acquisitions. Our management will have broad discretionin the application of the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will berelying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of theseproceeds. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerousfactors, including the cash used or generated in our operations, the status ofour development efforts, the level of our sales and marketing activities,technological advances and competitive pressures. We, therefore, cannot estimatethe amount of net proceeds that we receive in this offering which will be usedfor any of the purposes described above. Pending the use of proceeds from thisoffering, we intend to invest the proceeds in a variety of short-term,interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

All of the offering expenses to date have been paid from       advances we received from our existing stockholders as described below.       These advances will be repaid upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of       this offering or (ii) June 30, 2008. We expect that any increase in these       expenses, caused by unforeseen increases in legal, accounting, printing or       miscellaneous charges, will not exceed $200,000 in the aggregate.(2)    If the underwriters determine that the size of this offering should be       increased or decreased, or the underwriters exercise their over-allotment       option, the amount of interest income earned on the trust account that can       be released to us to fund our working capital will be proportionately       adjusted. The amount of interest income permitted to be released from the       trust account may be increased by up to $375,000 to the extent the over       allotment is exercised in full.   A total of approximately $98.0 million (or approximately $112.35 million ifthe underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the netproceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrantsdescribed in this prospectus, and $3.0 million (or $3.45 million if theunderwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferredunderwriting discounts and commissions, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. We believe the$100,000 of funds initially available to us outside of the trust account,together with the interest income, net of taxes, on the balance of the trustaccount to be released to us to fund our working capital and general corporaterequirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 36months, assuming a business combination is not completed during that time. Ifthe underwriters determine the size of this offering should be increased, or theunderwriters exercise their over-allotment option, it could also result in aproportionate increase in the amount of interest we may withdraw from the trustaccount.   Except for up to an aggregate of $2.5 million of the interest income, subjectto adjustment, net of taxes, earned on the balance in the trust account to bereleased to us to fund our working capital and general corporate requirementsand any amounts paid to redeeming stockholders voting against the extendedperiod, if any, upon approval by our stockholders, the proceeds held in thetrust account will not be released from the trust account until the earlier ofthe consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. If theunderwriters determine that the size of this offering should be increased, theamount of interest income earned on the trust account that can be released to usto fund our working capital will be increased proportionately. All amounts heldin the trust account that are not:   Âº distributed to public stockholders who exercise redemption rights,   Âº released to us to pay taxes;   Âº released to us as interest income, or   Âº payable to the underwriters for deferred discounts and commissions,   will be released to us on closing of our initial business combination.   Our initial business combination will be with one or more target businessesthat have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trustaccount (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.0million or $3.45 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercisedin full) at the time of such business combination, subject to:   Âº approval of a majority of our common stock voted by our public stockholders     (including our founders and special advisors with respect to shares     purchased in this offering or otherwise acquired in the public markets by     them) and public stockholders holding less than 33.33% of the shares of     common stock sold in this offering electing to exercise their redemption     rights (on a cumulative basis in connection with the extended period and     the business combination); and   Âº such deferred underwriting discount and commission having been paid to the     underwriters.   If our initial business combination involves a transaction in which weacquire less than a 100% interest in the target company, the value of thatinterest that we acquire will be equal to at least 80% of the sum of the balancein the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts andcommissions). In all instances, we would be the controlling stockholder of thetarget company. The key factors that we will rely on in determining controllingstockholder status would be our acquisition of at least 51% of the voting equityinterests of the target company and control of the majority of any governingbody of the target company. Except as described in the following paragraph, wewill not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria.   We intend to acquire an operating business through a stock exchange, assetacquisition or other similar business combination; however, there are a numberof industries in China in which direct foreign investment is restricted(including telecommunications services, online commerce and advertising).Therefore, if our target business is an industry that is subject to theserequirements we may seek to acquire control of our target business throughcontractual arrangements with licensed companies operating in China and theirowners. We may enter into a business combination in which we, our subsidiariesand/or affiliates, and the target business and its stockholders enter into aseries of contracts that are designed to secure for us economic benefits and toassume by us the risks of losses that are substantially similar to fullownership, although we would not be allowed to own the assets or obtain directcontrol of an operating company in a restricted industry in China. Thesecontracts could, for example, result in a structure where, in exchange for ourpayment of the acquisition consideration, the target business would be owned 100% by Chinese residents whom we designate, and the target business would continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its business. We may also establish a new subsidiary in China which would provide technology, technical support, consulting and related services to the target business in exchange for fees, which are designed to transfer to us substantially all of theeconomic benefits of ownership of the target business.   On release of funds from the trust account and after payment of theredemption price to any public stockholders who exercise their redemptionrights, the underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts andcommissions, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used topay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses withwhich our initial combination occurs. If the business combination is paid forusing stock or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from thetrust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance orexpansion of operations of the acquired business or businesses, the payment ofprincipal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initialbusiness combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for workingcapital.   We have agreed to pay Stuart Management Co., an affiliate of Paul K. Kelly, atotal of $10,000 per month for office space, administrative services andsecretarial support for a period commencing on the date of this prospectus andending on the earlier of our consummation of a business combination or ourliquidation. This arrangement is being agreed to by Stuart Management Co. forour benefit and is not intended to provide Stuart Management Co. compensation inlieu of a management fee or other remuneration because it is anticipated thatthe expenses to be paid by Stuart Management Co. will approximate the monthlyreimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we couldhave obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon consummation of a businesscombination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.   We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest incomethat may be released to us (as described in more detail below) will besufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated.This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertakenonly after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminaryagreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if ourestimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating abusiness combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we maybe required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost ofwhich is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additionalcapital through loans or additional investments from our founders, our specialadvisors or our directors. None of such founders, special advisors or ourdirectors is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.   Our existing stockholders have provided us with approximately $368,169 inloans to pay the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items abovefor the SEC registration fee, FINRA registration fee, American Stock Exchangefee and certain accounting and legal fees and expenses. Advances under the loansare non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due upon the earlier of (i) 30 daysafter the consummation of this offering or (ii) June 30, 2008. The loans will berepaid out of the proceeds of this offering not placed in the trust account.   The net proceeds of this offering not immediately required for the purposesset forth above will be invested only in United States ""government securities""(as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) and one or moremoney market funds, selected by us, which invest principally in eithershort-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United States having a ratingin the highest investment category granted thereby by a recognized credit ratingagency at the time of acquisition or short-term tax exempt municipal bondsissued by governmental entities located within the United States, so that we arenot deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Up toan aggregate of $2.5 million, subject to adjustment, of the interest income, netof taxes, on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the trustaccount to fund a portion of our working capital and general corporaterequirements.   Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarialservices described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder's andconsulting fees) will be paid to Paul K. Kelly or our other officers anddirectors, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to orin connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, ourofficers and directors will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expensesincurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such asidentifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitablebusiness combinations. We expect that due diligence of prospective targetbusinesses will be monitored or performed by Paul K. Kelly and James D. Dunning,Jr. Additionally, we may engage market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our audit committee will have the responsibility of reviewing and approving all expense reimbursements made to our officers and directors, provided that any expense reimbursements payable to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest income that is released to us from the trust account,Messrs. Paul K. Kelly and James D. Dunning, Jr. have agreed to satisfy any suchshortfall. Such out-of-pocket expenses by Messrs. Kelly and Dunning would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination. These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the target business' owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our directors to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in a conflict of interest.Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,we have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.   A stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, netof taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less interest incomereleased to us from the trust account in the manner described above) only in theevent of (i) our liquidation if we fail to complete a business combinationwithin the allotted time or (ii) if the public stockholder seeks to have usredeem such shares for cash in connection with (a) the proposal for the extendedperiod that the stockholder voted against and was actually approved by ourstockholders and/or (b) a business combination that the public stockholder votedagainst and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will astockholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trustaccount.   On consummation of an initial business combination, the underwriters willreceive the deferred underwriters' discounts and commissions held in the trustaccount. If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trusteemust therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation,the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferredunderwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interestthereon, in the trust account and (ii) that the trustee is authorized todistribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together withany accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, tothe public stockholders on a pro rata basis."

All of the offering expenses to date have been paid from       advances we received from our existing stockholders as described below.       These advances will be repaid upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of       this offering or (ii) June 30, 2008. We expect that any increase in these       expenses, caused by unforeseen increases in legal, accounting, printing or       miscellaneous charges, will not exceed $200,000 in the aggregate.(2)    If the underwriters determine that the size of this offering should be       increased or decreased, or the underwriters exercise their over-allotment       option, the amount of interest income earned on the trust account that can       be released to us to fund our working capital will be proportionately       adjusted. The amount of interest income permitted to be released from the       trust account may be increased by up to $375,000 to the extent the over       allotment is exercised in full.   A total of approximately $98.0 million (or approximately $112.35 million ifthe underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the netproceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrantsdescribed in this prospectus, and $3.0 million (or $3.45 million if theunderwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferredunderwriting discounts and commissions, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. We believe the$100,000 of funds initially available to us outside of the trust account,together with the interest income, net of taxes, on the balance of the trustaccount to be released to us to fund our working capital and general corporaterequirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 36months, assuming a business combination is not completed during that time. Ifthe underwriters determine the size of this offering should be increased, or theunderwriters exercise their over-allotment option, it could also result in aproportionate increase in the amount of interest we may withdraw from the trustaccount.   Except for up to an aggregate of $2.5 million of the interest income, subjectto adjustment, net of taxes, earned on the balance in the trust account to bereleased to us to fund our working capital and general corporate requirementsand any amounts paid to redeeming stockholders voting against the extendedperiod, if any, upon approval by our stockholders, the proceeds held in thetrust account will not be released from the trust account until the earlier ofthe consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. If theunderwriters determine that the size of this offering should be increased, theamount of interest income earned on the trust account that can be released to usto fund our working capital will be increased proportionately. All amounts heldin the trust account that are not:   Âº distributed to public stockholders who exercise redemption rights,   Âº released to us to pay taxes;   Âº released to us as interest income, or   Âº payable to the underwriters for deferred discounts and commissions,   will be released to us on closing of our initial business combination.   Our initial business combination will be with one or more target businessesthat have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trustaccount (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.0million or $3.45 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercisedin full) at the time of such business combination, subject to:   Âº approval of a majority of our common stock voted by our public stockholders     (including our founders and special advisors with respect to shares     purchased in this offering or otherwise acquired in the public markets by     them) and public stockholders holding less than 33.33% of the shares of     common stock sold in this offering electing to exercise their redemption     rights (on a cumulative basis in connection with the extended period and     the business combination); and   Âº such deferred underwriting discount and commission having been paid to the     underwriters.   If our initial business combination involves a transaction in which weacquire less than a 100% interest in the target company, the value of thatinterest that we acquire will be equal to at least 80% of the sum of the balancein the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts andcommissions). In all instances, we would be the controlling stockholder of thetarget company. The key factors that we will rely on in determining controllingstockholder status would be our acquisition of at least 51% of the voting equityinterests of the target company and control of the majority of any governingbody of the target company. Except as described in the following paragraph, wewill not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria.   We intend to acquire an operating business through a stock exchange, assetacquisition or other similar business combination; however, there are a numberof industries in China in which direct foreign investment is restricted(including telecommunications services, online commerce and advertising).Therefore, if our target business is an industry that is subject to theserequirements we may seek to acquire control of our target business throughcontractual arrangements with licensed companies operating in China and theirowners. We may enter into a business combination in which we, our subsidiariesand/or affiliates, and the target business and its stockholders enter into aseries of contracts that are designed to secure for us economic benefits and toassume by us the risks of losses that are substantially similar to fullownership, although we would not be allowed to own the assets or obtain directcontrol of an operating company in a restricted industry in China. Thesecontracts could, for example, result in a structure where, in exchange for ourpayment of the acquisition consideration, the target business would be owned 100% by Chinese residents whom we designate, and the target business would continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its business. We may also establish a new subsidiary in China which would provide technology, technical support, consulting and related services to the target business in exchange for fees, which are designed to transfer to us substantially all of theeconomic benefits of ownership of the target business.   On release of funds from the trust account and after payment of theredemption price to any public stockholders who exercise their redemptionrights, the underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts andcommissions, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used topay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses withwhich our initial combination occurs. If the business combination is paid forusing stock or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from thetrust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance orexpansion of operations of the acquired business or businesses, the payment ofprincipal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initialbusiness combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for workingcapital.   We have agreed to pay Stuart Management Co., an affiliate of Paul K. Kelly, atotal of $10,000 per month for office space, administrative services andsecretarial support for a period commencing on the date of this prospectus andending on the earlier of our consummation of a business combination or ourliquidation. This arrangement is being agreed to by Stuart Management Co. forour benefit and is not intended to provide Stuart Management Co. compensation inlieu of a management fee or other remuneration because it is anticipated thatthe expenses to be paid by Stuart Management Co. will approximate the monthlyreimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we couldhave obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon consummation of a businesscombination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.   We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest incomethat may be released to us (as described in more detail below) will besufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated.This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertakenonly after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminaryagreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if ourestimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating abusiness combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we maybe required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost ofwhich is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additionalcapital through loans or additional investments from our founders, our specialadvisors or our directors. None of such founders, special advisors or ourdirectors is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.   Our existing stockholders have provided us with approximately $368,169 inloans to pay the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items abovefor the SEC registration fee, FINRA registration fee, American Stock Exchangefee and certain accounting and legal fees and expenses. Advances under the loansare non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due upon the earlier of (i) 30 daysafter the consummation of this offering or (ii) June 30, 2008. The loans will berepaid out of the proceeds of this offering not placed in the trust account.   The net proceeds of this offering not immediately required for the purposesset forth above will be invested only in United States ""government securities""(as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) and one or moremoney market funds, selected by us, which invest principally in eithershort-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United States having a ratingin the highest investment category granted thereby by a recognized credit ratingagency at the time of acquisition or short-term tax exempt municipal bondsissued by governmental entities located within the United States, so that we arenot deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Up toan aggregate of $2.5 million, subject to adjustment, of the interest income, netof taxes, on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the trustaccount to fund a portion of our working capital and general corporaterequirements.   Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarialservices described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder's andconsulting fees) will be paid to Paul K. Kelly or our other officers anddirectors, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to orin connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, ourofficers and directors will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expensesincurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such asidentifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitablebusiness combinations. We expect that due diligence of prospective targetbusinesses will be monitored or performed by Paul K. Kelly and James D. Dunning,Jr. Additionally, we may engage market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our audit committee will have the responsibility of reviewing and approving all expense reimbursements made to our officers and directors, provided that any expense reimbursements payable to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest income that is released to us from the trust account,Messrs. Paul K. Kelly and James D. Dunning, Jr. have agreed to satisfy any suchshortfall. Such out-of-pocket expenses by Messrs. Kelly and Dunning would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination. These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the target business' owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our directors to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in a conflict of interest.Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,we have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.   A stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, netof taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less interest incomereleased to us from the trust account in the manner described above) only in theevent of (i) our liquidation if we fail to complete a business combinationwithin the allotted time or (ii) if the public stockholder seeks to have usredeem such shares for cash in connection with (a) the proposal for the extendedperiod that the stockholder voted against and was actually approved by ourstockholders and/or (b) a business combination that the public stockholder votedagainst and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will astockholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trustaccount.   On consummation of an initial business combination, the underwriters willreceive the deferred underwriters' discounts and commissions held in the trustaccount. If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trusteemust therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation,the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferredunderwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interestthereon, in the trust account and (ii) that the trustee is authorized todistribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together withany accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, tothe public stockholders on a pro rata basis."

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the sellingstockholders.    We currently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds of thisoffering.

The timing and amount ofour actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows fromoperations and the anticipated growth of our business.

In addition, we may choose to useall or any part of the net proceeds from this offering to repay outstandingborrowings under our revolving line of credit from time to time. As ofSeptember 30, 2007, we had $9.8 million outstanding under this revolving line ofcredit. The interest rate on the revolving line of credit varies between primerate plus 1% to 2% based on certain minimum tangible net worth levels of 3PAR.The revolving line of credit expires on March 31, 2008.Additionally, we may expand our current business through acquisitions of otherbusinesses, products or technologies. However, we do not have agreements orcommitments for any specific acquisitions at this time.Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest theproceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,investment-grade and interest-bearing instruments."

We estimate thatour net proceeds will be approximately $538.06 million if the underwritersexercise their overallotment option in full.     Concurrent with this offering, we also expect to sell 9.8% of our shares,excluding shares sold pursuant to the underwritersâ€™ exercise of theiroverallotment option and shares of our restricted common stock approved to begranted to our executive officers and employees of our Manager and to ourindependent directors, to Annaly at a price per share equal to the initialpublic offering price. No underwriting discount is payable in connection withthe sale of shares to Annaly. We plan to invest the net proceeds of thisoffering and the concurrent sale of shares to Annaly in accordance with ourinvestment objectives and the strategies described in this prospectus.      We intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in prime and Alt-Amortgage loans, non-Agency RMBS, Agency RMBS and ABS, CDOs, CMBS and otherconsumer or non-consumer ABS. Initially, we expect to focus our investmentactivities on purchasing residential mortgage loans that have been originated byselect high-quality originators, including the retail lending operations ofleading commercial banks, and non-Agency RMBS. As the diligence and acquisitionlead times for residential mortgage loans are longer than for non-Agency RMBSpurchases, we expect our investment portfolio at the outset to be weightedtoward non-Agency RMBS, subject to maintaining our REIT qualification and our1940 Act exemption, but we expect our investment portfolio to become weightedtoward residential mortgage loans over the next three to six months. Untilappropriate investments can be identified, our Manager may invest the netproceeds of this offering and the concurrent sale of shares to Annaly ininterest-bearing short-term investments, including money market accounts, thatare consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. These investments areexpected to provide a lower net return than we hope to achieve from investmentsin our intended use of proceeds of this offering. We expect to reallocate aportion of the net proceeds from this offering into a more diversified portfolioof investments within six months, subject to the availability of appropriateinvestment opportunities.

We intend to use our net proceeds from the shares that wesell in this offering to pay $6.9 million to members of our current and formermanagement pursuant to provisions in their employment agreements, to repay$232.2 million of outstanding debt under our credit facilities and to pay $7.4million of fees and accrued interest to lenders under these facilities.As of September 30, 2007, we had $877.2 million of borrowings outstanding underour credit facilities. We repaid $10 million of these borrowings during October2007.

The amounts weactually expend in these areas may vary significantly from our currentintentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including FDA approval forour product, future sales growth, success of research and product developmentefforts, cash generated from future operations and actual expenses to operateour business.As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of theparticular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of thisoffering.

Our actual expenses for some or all of these     items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.                                        (3)Âº The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain     constant at $50,000 even if the underwriters' over-allotment option is     exercised. In addition, $2,750,000 of interest income earned on the amounts     held in the trust account (subject to the tax holdback described in this     prospectus) will be available to us to pay for our working capital     requirements potentially including the items described above. For purposes     of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total     amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.(4)Âº These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these     items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may     incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in     connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based     upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not     anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than     fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which     fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific     category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital. (5) Âº The miscellaneous expenses may include deposits or down payments for a     proposed initial business combination, corporate franchise taxes, director     and officer liability insurance premiums, brokers' retainer fees,     consulting fees, finders' fees and fees payable to Continental Stock     Transfer & Trust Company for serving as trustee and our transfer agent.    A total of approximately $247.0 million (or approximately $283.4 million ifthe underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), of the netproceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsors' warrants described inthis prospectus, including $10.0 million (or approximately $11.5 million if theunderwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferredunderwriting discounts and commissions will be placed in a trust account atJPMorgan Chase, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, astrustee. Except for a portion of the interest income that may be released to us,or used to pay taxes, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from thetrust account until the earlier of the completion of an initial businesscombination or our liquidation. All amounts held in the trust account that arenot converted to cash or released to us as interest income, or used to paytaxes, will be released promptly after closing of our initial businesscombination with one or more target businesses which collectively have a fairmarket value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excludingdeferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $10.0 million, orapproximately $11.5 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option isexercised in full) at the time of such business combination, subject to (i) amajority of our public stockholders voting in favor of the initial businesscombination, (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock beingvoted in favor of the amendment to our amended and restated certificate ofincorporation providing for our perpetual existence and (iii) publicstockholders holding not more than 30% of the shares (minus one share) sold inthis offering electing to exercise their conversion rights, and subject to suchdeferred underwriting discount and commission having been paid to theunderwriters. We will only consummate a business combination in which we becomethe controlling shareholder of the target. The key factor that we will rely onin determining controlling shareholder status would be our acquisition of atleast 50.1% of the voting equity interests of the target company. We will notconsider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Upon release of fundsfrom the trust account and after payment of the conversion price to any publicstockholders who exercise their conversion rights, the underwriters will receivetheir deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, and the remaining fundswill be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchaseprice of the business or businesses with which our initial business combinationoccurs. If the initial business combination is paid for using stock or debtsecurities, we may use the cash released to us from the trust account forgeneral corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operationsof acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due onindebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fundthe purchase of other companies, or for working capital.    We have agreed to pay Teleos Management, L.L.C., an entity affiliated withDaniel Gressel, one of our directors, a total of $4,500 per month and LLMCapital Partners LLC, an entity affiliated with Patrick J. Landers, ourpresident and a director, LLM Structured Equity Fund L.P. and LLM InvestorsL.P., a total of $3,000 per month for office space, administrative services andsecretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by each of TeleosManagement, L.L.C. and LLM Capital Partners LLC for our benefit and is notintended to provide Mr. Gressel or Mr. Landers compensation in lieu of a salaryor other remuneration because it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid byTeleos Management, L.L.C. and LLM Capital Partners LLC, a total of $7,500 permonth will approximate the monthly respective reimbursements. We believe thatsuch fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from anunaffiliated person. Upon completion of an initial business combination or ourliquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.    We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will beperformed by some or all of the members of our management team and may includeengaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. No compensationof any kind, including finders' and consulting fees, will be paid to awarded toor earned by any of our initial stockholders, sponsors, officers or directors,or to any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or inconnection with the consummation of an initial business combination, other thana total of $7,500 per month for office space and administrative services,including secretarial support. However, these individuals will be reimbursed forany out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalfsuch as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence onsuitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review and approve allexpense reimbursements made to our initial stockholders, sponsors, officers ordirectors and their respective affiliates (other than the $7,500 monthly paymentdescribed above) and any payments made to members of our audit committee will bereviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the interested director ordirectors abstaining from such review and approval.    We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income ofup to $2.75 million earned on the trust account balance that may be released tous subject to the tax holdback (as described in more detail in this prospectus)will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds areallocated as well as any additional expenses that may be incurred by us inconnection with this offering over and above the amounts specified in this ""Useof Proceeds"" section. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth duediligence will be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letterof intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initialbusiness combination. Although we do not know the rate of interest to be earnedon the trust account and are unable to predict an exact amount of time it willtake to complete any initial business combination, we believe that following thecompletion of this offering, it will take a significant amount of time to find aprospective target business and take all of the steps necessary to complete aninitial business combination. We anticipate that, even at an interest rate of 3%per annum, the interest that will accrue on the trust account during the time itwill take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient tofund our working capital requirements. Given the limited amount of time it willtake to generate $2.75 million of interest on the trust account, we anticipatereceiving such interest income generally shortly after we incur working capitalexpenses. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth duediligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than theactual amount necessary to do so, or if interest payments are not available tofund the expenses at the time we incur them, we may be required to raiseadditional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currentlyunascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital throughloans or additional investments from members of our management team, but suchmembers of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,or invest in, us. To the extent that the underwriters exercise theirover-allotment option, the maximum amount of interest income we may withdrawfrom the trust account will proportionally increase. If our expenses exceed theamounts not held in the trust account and the interest income that may bereleased to us from the trust account (subject to the tax holdback described inthis prospectus), such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. Since the role of our officers and directors after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to current officers and directors after our initial business combination. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed by us prior to the closing of our initial business combination. If the owners of the target business do not agree to suchrepayment, this could cause our officers and directors to view such potentialinitial business combination unfavorably and result in a potential conflict ofinterest. There is no limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us tosuch persons. A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from thetrust account only in the event of our liquidation if we fail to complete abusiness combination within the allotted time or if the public stockholder seeksto convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination thatthe public stockholder voted against and that we actually complete. In no othercircumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kindin or to funds in the trust account.    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect an initial business combination, the proceeds held inthe trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used tofinance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds couldbe used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the targetbusiness' operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research anddevelopment of existing or new products or services. Such funds could also beused to repay any operating expenses or finders' fees which we had incurredprior to the completion of our business combination if the funds available to usoutside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.    As of the date of this prospectus, Flat Ridge Investments LLC, LLMStructured Equity Fund L.P. and LLM Investors L.P. advanced to us a total of$200,000, a portion of which was used to pay certain expenses of this offeringreferenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRAregistration fee, American Stock Exchange fee and accounting and legal fees andexpenses. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at theearlier of July 10, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will berepaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trustaccount and interest released from the trust account.    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only inUnited States ""governmental securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16)of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, orin money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgatedunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be aninvestment company under the Investment Company Act. Interest income earned onthe trust account balance released to us to pay any tax obligations and, inaddition, interest income earned of up to $2.75 million (subject to the taxholdback described in this prospectus) on the trust account balance may bereleasable to us from the trust account to fund working capital requirements.    On completion of our initial business combination, the underwriters willreceive the deferred underwriters' discounts and commissions held in the trustaccount. If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trusteemust distribute the balance in the trust account, the underwriters have agreed(i) on our liquidation to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferredunderwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued interest thereon,then in the trust account, and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to distributethe deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accruedinterest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, to the publicstockholders on a pro rata basis."

If the underwriters exercise theiroverallotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds would beapproximately $81.3 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discountsand commissions and estimated offering expenses that we must pay.The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital and tocreate a public market for our common stock.

The loan and security agreementprovides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $12 million and arevolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4 million.The term loan bears interest at the prime rate (which was 8.25% as of September30, 2007) plus 3.375%, and the revolving credit facility bears interest at theprime rate plus 0.25%. The term loan has a maturity date of December 31, 2010and the revolving credit facility has a maturity date of April 1, 2008. There isno penalty for prepayment of the term loan. We used the proceeds of this loanfor working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.We expect to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for workingcapital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.Until we use the net proceeds from this offering for the above purposes, weintend to invest the proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearingsecurities."

Over the next 12 to 24months we plan to launch several SKUs in the Ginger Brew line, several new SKUsin the Virgilâ€™s line, four new China Cola SKUs, and several additional newfrozen confections and new candies. A SKU is an identifier that is used bymerchants to permit the systematic tracking of products and services offered tocustomers. We intend to expend some, but not a significant amount of funds onresearch and development for new products and packaging. The speed with which weexpand our marketing and advertising for our products, and the number ofproducts we offer to the public, will depend in large part on the number ofshares of common stock sold in this offering. If only a limited number of sharesare sold, our expansion plans will take substantially longer to implement. (3) We will attempt to place our products in up to 30,000 new stores. Somestores, particularly chains, require slotting fees to place product on storeshelves. Currently, we do not pay slotting fees to place a majority of ourproducts in stores. Slotting fees in the natural food section of the supermarketare generally not as expensive as in other areas of the store. However, in thefuture, we may have to pay slotting fees, depending upon the type of stores andchains where we place our products. (4) We plan to use strategic consumer and trade targeted advertising to buildbrand awareness, and support existing and new product placements. Ouradvertising plans include print ads in magazine and newspapers, public relationsevents and consumer event sponsorships at which we offer samples of ourproducts. (5) Our marketing plans include placing up to 2,000 Reedâ€™s branded refrigeratedcoolers and Reedâ€™s branded in-store displays, which we call Kegerators,throughout the United States and, to a lesser degree, in Canada. We considercoolers and in-store displays to be efficient and proven marketing tools. (6) Currently our Chief Executive Officer, Christopher J. Reed, serves as ourChief Financial Officer. Mr. Reed does not have any formal financial training asa Chief Financial Officer. Due to the increasing complexity of accountancy andcash management for reporting companies we have set aside this amount from theproceeds of the offering to pay all or a portion of the first yearâ€™scompensation for a new Chief Financial Officer that we are in the process ofrecruiting. (7) Depending upon the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to purchasepackaging automation equipment for the Brewery. This will allow us to increaseproduction capacity and reduce overall time that our products can be inproduction, while decreasing labor costs. (8) In June 2005, we entered into a revolving loan and security agreementpursuant to which we are able to borrow up to $1,400,000. As of June 30, 2006,we had $386,000 available for borrowing under the revolving loan agreement. Thisrevolving loan matures on June 30, 2007. We may extend this revolving loan orseek to obtain a replacement line of credit for that credit facility. If weextend the loan agreement or obtain a replacement line of credit, we may usesome of the proceeds from this offering to pay down amounts payable under anysuch credit facility. However, we may use any funds available under any suchcredit facility as working capital. We intend to use a portion of any fundsborrowed pursuant to this loan agreement, in addition to the proceeds from thesale of the shares in this offering, for the uses described above. We cannot assure you that the above dollar amounts will be specificallyallocated as set forth in the foregoing table. Our management has discretion inthe application of the actual net proceeds of the offering.

Over the next 12 to 24months we plan to launch several SKUs in the Ginger Brew line, several new SKUsin the Virgilâ€™s line, four new China Cola SKUs, and several additional newfrozen confections and new candies. A SKU is an identifier that is used bymerchants to permit the systematic tracking of products and services offered tocustomers. We intend to expend some, but not a significant amount of funds onresearch and development for new products and packaging. The speed with which weexpand our marketing and advertising for our products, and the number ofproducts we offer to the public, will depend in large part on the number ofshares of common stock sold in this offering. If only a limited number of sharesare sold, our expansion plans will take substantially longer to implement. (3) We will attempt to place our products in up to 30,000 new stores. Somestores, particularly chains, require slotting fees to place product on storeshelves. Currently, we do not pay slotting fees to place a majority of ourproducts in stores. Slotting fees in the natural food section of the supermarketare generally not as expensive as in other areas of the store. However, in thefuture, we may have to pay slotting fees, depending upon the type of stores andchains where we place our products. (4) We plan to use strategic consumer and trade targeted advertising to buildbrand awareness, and support existing and new product placements. Ouradvertising plans include print ads in magazine and newspapers, public relationsevents and consumer event sponsorships at which we offer samples of ourproducts. (5) Our marketing plans include placing up to 2,000 Reedâ€™s branded refrigeratedcoolers and Reedâ€™s branded in-store displays, which we call Kegerators,throughout the United States and, to a lesser degree, in Canada. We considercoolers and in-store displays to be efficient and proven marketing tools. (6) Currently our Chief Executive Officer, Christopher J. Reed, serves as ourChief Financial Officer. Mr. Reed does not have any formal financial training asa Chief Financial Officer. Due to the increasing complexity of accountancy andcash management for reporting companies we have set aside this amount from theproceeds of the offering to pay all or a portion of the first yearâ€™scompensation for a new Chief Financial Officer that we are in the process ofrecruiting. (7) Depending upon the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to purchasepackaging automation equipment for the Brewery. This will allow us to increaseproduction capacity and reduce overall time that our products can be inproduction, while decreasing labor costs. (8) In June 2005, we entered into a revolving loan and security agreementpursuant to which we are able to borrow up to $1,400,000. As of June 30, 2006,we had $386,000 available for borrowing under the revolving loan agreement. Thisrevolving loan matures on June 30, 2007. We may extend this revolving loan orseek to obtain a replacement line of credit for that credit facility. If weextend the loan agreement or obtain a replacement line of credit, we may usesome of the proceeds from this offering to pay down amounts payable under anysuch credit facility. However, we may use any funds available under any suchcredit facility as working capital. We intend to use a portion of any fundsborrowed pursuant to this loan agreement, in addition to the proceeds from thesale of the shares in this offering, for the uses described above. We cannot assure you that the above dollar amounts will be specificallyallocated as set forth in the foregoing table. Our management has discretion inthe application of the actual net proceeds of the offering. Allocation of netproceeds is further subject to future events including changes in generaleconomic conditions, changes in our strategy and our response to competitivepressures and consumer preferences associated with the products we sell. Pendingfull utilization of the proceeds from this offering, we may invest the netproceeds in highly liquid, investment grade securities."

the proceeds of      a $258,300 loan from Mr. Heckmann, as described below. This loan, plus            interest accruing at a rate of 3.60% per year, will be repaid out of the          proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account upon              consummation of this offering. As of October 3, 2007, $3,032 of interest has      accrued on this loan.                                                       (2)   The underwriters have agreed to defer a portion of their underwriting             discount, equal to 4.5% of the gross proceeds of the public portion of this       offering, until the consummation of a business combination. Upon the              consummation of a business combination, such deferred discount will be             released to the underwriters out of the gross proceeds of this offering held       in a trust account maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company,          acting as trustee. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest           accrued on the deferred discount.                                            (3)   Includes $258,300, plus interest, that will be used to repay the loan from        Mr. Heckmann.                                                               (4)   Total includes an aggregate of approximately $1,000,000 that we expect to         budget for consultants in connection with legal and financial due diligence       investigations of prospective targets.                                      (5)   These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all        of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,       we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current               estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business               combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination.      In the event the SEC amends its reporting rules in a manner affecting our         reporting obligations, we would likely incur greater expenses relating to         SEC reporting obligations. In the event we identify an acquisition target in      a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional      expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special        legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we       may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due         diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,       other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,       which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any           specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working          capital. Any such interest income not used to fund our working capital            requirements or repay advances from our founders or for due diligence or          legal, accounting and non-due diligence expenses will be usable by us to pay      other expenses that may exceed our current estimates.                       The $395,960,000 trust amount (or $454,460,000 if the over-allotment option isexercised in full) will be placed in a trust account maintained by AmericanStock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The $395,960,000 trust amountincludes $18,000,000 of the proceeds attributable to the underwritersâ€™ discount.The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States â€œgovernmentsecuritiesâ€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Actof 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meetingthe conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the InvestmentCompany Act. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until theearlier of the consummation of a business combination and our dissolution andliquidation; provided, however, a portion of the interest earned on the trustaccount (net of taxes) will be released to us to cover our operating expenses.We will withdraw such interest until a maximum of $4,500,000 of such interesthas been released from the trust account. If we are required to dissolve, wewill pay for the costs of dissolution from our remaining assets outside thetrust account. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs andexpenses associated with implementing our plan of distribution, to the extentthat there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to payincome taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we mayrequest that the trustee release to us an additional amount of up to $75,000 ofsuch accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. While we will seekwaivers from all target acquisitions, vendors and service providers to claims toamounts in the trust account, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtainany such waiver or that any such waiver will be held valid and enforceable. Ifwe dissolve and liquidate prior to a business combination, Mr. Heckmann, ourChairman and Chief Executive Officer, has agreed that he will be liable to us ifand to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products soldto us, or a prospective target business reduce the amounts in the trust accountavailable for distribution to our stockholders in the event of a liquidation,except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and allrights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims by theunderwriters in connection with this offering. Based on discussions our board ofdirectors has had with Mr. Heckmann, including a review of financialinformation, our board of directors is satisfied that he will be able to satisfythis obligation; however, there is no guarantee that he will be able to do so.The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay thesellers of a target acquisition with which we consummate a business combination(excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of thedeferred portion of the underwritersâ€™ discount). Any amounts not paid asconsideration to the sellers of the target acquisition will be used to financeour operations, which may include the target acquisition we acquired on theconsummation of the business combination, to consummate other acquisitions, orfor working capital, as determined by our board of directors at that time.We have agreed to pay Mr. Heckmann a monthly fee of $10,000 for general andadministrative services, including office space, utilities and administrativesupport commencing on the effective date of the proposed offering andterminating upon completion of our business combination or the distribution ofthe trust account to our public stockholders eligible to receive distributions.This arrangement is being agreed to by Mr. Heckmann for our benefit and is notintended to provide him compensation in lieu of a salary. This amount wasdetermined based on our understanding of typical fees for similar services inthe Southern California area. We believe the monthly administrative fees paid byother blank check companies range from $7,500 to $10,000 per month. We believe,based on fees for similar services in the Southern California area, that the feecharged by Mr. Heckmann is at least as favorable as we could have obtained froman unaffiliated person.Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option infull, the net proceeds available to us out of the trust for our search for abusiness combination will consist of the $4,500,000 of interest earned on thetrust account. We intend to use this amount for corporate franchise taxpayments, American Stock Exchange listing fees, due diligence, legal, accountingand other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business combination, aswell as a possible down payment, lockup or â€œno-shopâ€ù provision (a provision inletters of intent designed to keep target acquisitions from â€œshoppingâ€ù aroundfor transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such targetacquisitions), and if necessary, to bear the costs of liquidation anddissolution in the event we are unable to consummate a business combinationwithin 24 months after the consummation of this offering. While we do not haveany current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to fund aâ€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respect to a particular proposed business combination,if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right toreceive exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount that would be used asa down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would be determined based on theterms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available fundsat the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach orotherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searchingfor, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target acquisitions.In addition to the use of funds described above, we could also use a portion ofthese funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a targetacquisition or acquisitions. We believe that this amount will be sufficient tocover the foregoing expenses.To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or inpart as consideration to consummate a business combination, the proceeds held inthe trust account that are not used to consummate a business combination will bedisbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceedsnot expended, be used as working capital to finance our operations.We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a businesscombination, either because the consideration for the business combination isless than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of theconsideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event, theproceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds notexpended will be used to finance our operations, which may include the targetacquisition or acquisitions that we acquire in the business combination, toconsummate other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by ourboard of directors at that time.Mr. Heckmann has loaned a total of $258,300 to us to fund a portion of theoffering expenses owed by us to third parties. The loan bears interest at a rateof 3.60% per year and will be payable on the earlier of December 1, 2007 and theconsummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds usedto pay the offering expenses. As of October 3, 2007, $3,032 of interest hasaccrued on this loan.The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only inâ€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù or in money market funds meeting the conditions underRule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we arenot deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Theincome derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period that isnot otherwise returned to public stockholders who vote against a businesscombination will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, aswell as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business combination is consummated.We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, as we seek toconsummate a business combination. We will only consummate a businesscombination if, at the time of the acquisition, we expect to have sufficientcash and working capital to operate the target acquisition on a forward-lookingbasis.Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation ofa business combination, we will pay Mr. Heckmann the administrative services feedescribed above. Other than this $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of anykind (including finders, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to anyof our founders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services thatthey render in order to consummate, or in connection with the consummation ofthe business combination. However, such individuals will receive reimbursement,subject to approval of our audit committee, for any out-of-pocket expensesincurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such asidentifying potential target acquisitions, performing business due diligence onsuitable target acquisitions and business combinations, as well as traveling toand from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective targetacquisitions to examine their operations. Additionally, there is no limit on theamount of out-of-pocket expenses that could be incurred and there will be noreview of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our auditcommittee, which would include persons who may seek reimbursement.A stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on the trust account) only in the event of ourdissolution and subsequent liquidation of the trust account pursuant to thetrust agreement or if that stockholder converts its shares into cash inconnection with a business combination that the public stockholder voted againstand that we consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder haveany right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Our founders haveagreed to waive their right to receive any funds from the trust account withrespect to the 14,375,000 foundersâ€™ shares. In addition, our founders cannotconvert any of their foundersâ€™ shares into cash because they have agreed not tovote these shares against a business combination approved by a majority of theoutstanding shares voted by our public stockholders, which is a necessarycondition to convert.Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will beentitled to receive the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. In theevent that we are unable to consummate a business combination and the trustee isforced to dissolve and liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreedthat: (1) they will forfeit any rights or claims to such deferred underwritingdiscounts and commissions and any accrued interest thereon; and (2) the proceedsattributable to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions will bedistributed on a pro rata basis among the public stockholders along with anyaccrued interest thereon."

Theshares of common stock that may be purchased by the underwriters upon exerciseof their over-allotment option are shares outstanding before this offering andnot additional shares issuable by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment optionis exercised in full, it is estimated that the selling stockholders' netproceeds will be approximately $8,928,000. We will not receive any of theproceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock offered by the sellingstockholders pursuant to the exercise, if any, of the over-allotment option.    We currently plan to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering toacquire additional facilities, for expansion, improvements and upgrades to ourexisting facilities and to pay down debt. We currently have approximately$13.5 million budgeted for significant capital refurbishments at existingfacilities in 2007. We currently plan to use approximately $16.0 million of thenet proceeds from this offering to purchase four facilities that we currentlyoperate under operating lease agreements. Of this amount, we expect to useapproximately $3.0 million to purchase one facility from Lone Peak Properties,LLC, in which the purchase is pending the property owner's resolution of certainboundary line issues with neighboring property owners. We expect to use theremaining $13.0 million to purchase three facilities from Health CareProperties, Inc. on or before December 14, 2007, but may choose to fund thesepurchases under the Revolver. As of September 30, 2007, we held options topurchase 12 of our leased facilities. We will consider exercising some or all ofsuch options as they become exercisable and may use a portion of the netproceeds to pay the purchase price for these facilities. We anticipate payingoff our $2.1 million mortgage note in 2008, which mortgage note has a fixedinterest rate of 7.49% and is due on September 1, 2008, and we will alsoconsider paying off all or a portion of our short-term debt, if any, that isincurred in connection with facility acquisitions. If we do not complete thetransactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter described below in""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperationsâ€”Liquidity and Capital Resources,"" we intend to use proceeds of thisoffering and/or seek alternative sources of working capital financing to replacethe Revolver. As of September 30, 2007, we have no amounts outstanding under theRevolver. Further, if we do not complete the transactions contemplated by theCommitment Letter, we will use approximately $8.4 million of the net proceedsfrom this offering to collateralize outstanding letters of credit currentlysecured by the available borrowing capacity of the Revolver.    We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering forworking capital and for general corporate purposes.    As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all ofthe particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. The amountsactually expended for the purposes indicated above will depend upon a number offactors, including the availability of suitable facilities, the related leaserates and acquisition costs, the status of the real estate market, constructionand related materials costs, as well as other industry related factors.Accordingly, our management will retain broad discretion in the allocation ofthe net proceeds from this offering. Pending their use, we anticipate investingthe net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing,investment-grade securities."

Our estimated net proceeds from the offering represent theamount we expect to receive after the underwriting discount and our payment ofthe other expenses of the offering payable by us. We intend to use all of theproceeds we receive from this offering to pay the special distribution discussedbelow. We intend to use the proceeds, if any, we receive from the underwritersexercise of their over-allotment option to pay the amount of the distribution inexcess of the proceeds and any fees and expenses of this offering instead ofusing our cash on hand, and for general corporate purposes. We anticipate thatthe special distribution will exceed our net proceeds from this offering by$8.3 million, and, to the extent that the underwriters do not exercise theirover-allotment option, we will pay this excess amount from our cash on hand. We will declare a special distribution that will be payable promptly after thecompletion of this offering to our stockholders of record immediately prior tothe completion of this offering. The aggregate amount of the specialdistribution will be equal to the gross proceeds from the sale of stock in thisoffering before the underwriting discount and before expenses, excluding anyproceeds received by us in the event the underwriters exercise theirover-allotment option. The amount of the special distribution will be$93.8 million, or approximately $7.63 per common share on an as if convertedbasis. The payment of the special distribution with the estimated proceeds ofthis offering to us permits a return of capital to all of our existingstockholders, and does so without significantly decreasing our capital resourcesor requiring these stockholders to sell their shares."

Units under the purchase option and the proceeds       from the exercise of any Warrants.                                           (2) Approximately $130,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC               registration fee, the FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the        AMEX filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid        from the funds we received from our Chief Executive Officer and President and    from 2020 International Capital Group Limited, described below. These funds      will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust    upon consummation of this offering.                                          (3) For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are reflected as the    amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of the offering. An         additional $2,100,000 (or $2,415,000 if the over- allotment option is            exercised in full) all of which will be deposited in trust following the         consummation of the offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and when    we consummate a business combination.                                        (4) The legal fees in excess of $350,000 payable to Seyfarth Shaw LLP, our legal     counsel, have been deferred and are not payable by us if we do not consummate    a business combination.                                                      (5) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $150,000        even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition to the offering of units    by this prospectus, Win Wide, an entity in which George Lu, our Chief            Executive Officer and President, his wife Yanmei May Yang and Jianming Yu,       one of our directors, collectively own approximately 67% of the outstanding      securities, and Surfmax II, a company currently wholly owned by Mr. Lu, have     committed to purchase from us the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase    price of approximately $2,265,000). The purchase price of the warrants will      be funded by the shareholders of the purchaser. This purchase will take place    on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this        offering. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the       purchase of the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this       purchase will be placed in the trust account described below.                $59,405,685, or $68,090,685 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,of net proceeds of this offering, including the $2,265,000 we will receive fromthe sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at LaSalleBank National Association with LaSalle Bank National Association Chicago,Illinois serving as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwritingdiscounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. Theunderwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until weconsummate a business combination and have waived their right to receive suchpayment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete a businesscombination. The funds held in trust will be invested only in US â€œgovernmentsecuritiesâ€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Acthaving a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certainconditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, so thatwe are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.Except with respect to $1,350,000 of interest income, net of taxes, that may bereleased to us to fund operating expenses, the proceeds held in trust will notbe released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of abusiness combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust accountmay be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with whichwe complete a business combination.We have agreed to pay Surfmax Corporation, a company wholly-owned by George Lu,our Chief Executive Officer and President, $7,500 per month for office space andgeneral and administrative services. We believe that such fee is at least asfavorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completionof a business combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required topay these monthly fees.Other than the $7,500 administrative fees to Surfmax Corporation describedabove, no compensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s, consulting or othersimilar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, specialadvisors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for anyservices they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the businesscombination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, suchindividuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurredby them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifyingpotential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitabletarget businesses and business combinations, as well as traveling to and fromthe offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses toexamine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us outof the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to â€œLegal, accounting andother third-party expenses attendant to the due diligence investigation,structuring and negotiation of a business combination,â€ù â€œDue diligence ofprospective target businesses by officers, directors, existing stockholders orspecial advisorsâ€ù and â€œWorking capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&Oinsurance, taxes, general corporate purposes, dissolution obligations andreserves.â€ù Since the role of present management after a business combination isuncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will bepaid to those persons after a business combination.Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the netproceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a business combinationwill be approximately $1,500,000, including the $150,000 from the net proceedsthat will not be deposited in the trust account and the interest earned on thefunds in the trust account of up to $1,350,000, net of taxes, that may bereleased to us to fund our working capital requirements and that will be addedto our excess working capital. We intend to use the excess working capital(approximately $320,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums(approximately $75,000), with the balance of $245,000 being held in reserve fortax payments and in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and otherexpenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed ourestimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurredby our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf asdescribed above. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficientto cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portionof the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist uswith our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the fundsnot being placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision (aprovision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses fromâ€œshoppingâ€ù around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorableto such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed businesscombination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If weentered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receiveexclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a downpayment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision would be determined based on the termsof the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds atthe time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach orotherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searchingfor, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash orcash equivalents or will be invested only in US â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù so thatwe are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.The income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period willbe used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costsrelating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, includingassociated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. Theallocation of net proceeds not held in trust represents our best estimate of theintended uses of these funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to beinaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above describedcategories.We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business andto pay our expenses relating thereto. The funds used to pay the representativeof the underwriters will not be available to us to use in connection with orfollowing the business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is usedin whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, theproceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a businesscombination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with anyother net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance theoperations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in avariety of ways including continuing or expanding the target businessâ€™operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research anddevelopment of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repayany operating expenses or findersâ€™ fees which we had incurred prior to thecompletion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside ofthe trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will paythe costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.Our Chief Executive Officer and President has advanced to us a total of $50,000and 2020 International Capital Group Limited, a company controlled by ourexecutive officers has advanced to us a total of $80,000 which was used to pay aportion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above forSEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee and legal and audit fees and expenses.The $80,000 from 2020 International Capital Group Limited was funded by itsmembers. The $50,000 loan will be payable without interest on the earlier ofDecember 17, 2007 or the consummation of this offering. The $80,000 loan will bepayable without interest on the earlier of April 5, 2008 or the consummation ofthis offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering notbeing placed in trust.We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a businesscombination is not consummated during that time.A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on the stockholderâ€™s portion of the trust account)only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts suchshares into cash in connection with a business combination which the publicstockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstanceswill a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in thetrust account."

Quest Cherokee, our principaloperating subsidiary, is a co-borrower on our Parentâ€™s existing creditfacilities. We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option to redeem the number of common units from our Parent equalto the number of common units issued upon the exercise of the underwritersâ€™option. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, ourParentâ€™s ownership of common units will be reduced from 3,201,521 common unitsto 1,836,521 common units, representing, together with its subordinated units,an aggregate 49.5% limited partner interest in us, and the ownership interest ofthe public unitholders will increase to 10,465,000 representing an aggregate48.5% limited partner interest in us. The indebtedness to be repaid consists of: â€¢  $50.0 million first lien term loan under a Senior Credit Agreement among      our Parent and Quest Cherokee, as co-borrowers, Guggenheim Corporate          Funding, LLC (â€œGuggenheimâ€ù), as administrative agent and syndication agent,   and the lenders party thereto. The Senior Credit Agreement also includes a    $50.0 million revolving credit facility, which had $10.0 million outstanding   thereunder as of June 30, 2007;                                   â€¢  $100.0 million under a Second Lien Term Loan Agreement among our Parent and   Quest Cherokee, as co-borrowers, Guggenheim, as Administrative Agent, and     the lenders party thereto; and                                                â€¢  $75.0 million under a Third Lien Term Loan Agreement among our Parent and     Quest Cherokee, Guggenheim, as Administrative Agent, and the lenders party    thereto.                                                                   The following table sets forth our expected net proceeds from this offering,together with borrowings under our new credit facility and our Parentâ€™s newcredit facility and the use of proceeds:                                                                                                                                                               Total                                                                            Sources of Funds (in millions):                                                      Estimated proceeds, net of estimated underwriting discounts, a                      structuring fee and offering expenses                                       $ 151.2  New credit facility                                                            75.0  Parentâ€™s new credit facility(1)                                                16.5                                                                                       Total Sources                                                               $ 242.7                                                                                       Uses of Funds (in millions):                                                         Repayment of Parentâ€™s first lien term loan                                  $  50.0  Repayment of Parentâ€™s second lien term loan(2)                                102.3  Repayment of Parentâ€™s third lien term loan(3)                                  76.9  Repayment of Parentâ€™s revolving credit facility(1)                             10.0  Loan origination costs for new credit facility                                  3.5                                                                                       Total Uses                                                                  $ 242.7                                                                                        (1)   Our Parentâ€™s Senior Credit Agreement has a $50.0 million revolving credit         facility that matures on November 14, 2010. As of June 30, 2007,                  $10.0 million was borrowed under this facility. If on the closing date of         this offering, the amount outstanding under our Parentâ€™s revolving credit         facility exceeds $10.0 million, the additional amount will be repaid with         additional borrowings under our Parentâ€™s new credit facility. Our Parentâ€™s        new credit facility will not be guaranteed by us or secured by the                Partnership Properties.                                                      (2)  Includes a 2.25% prepayment premium of $2.3 million.   (3)  Includes a 2.5% prepayment premium of $1.9 million. Interest accrues on our Parentâ€™s revolving credit facility at LIBOR plus 1.75%or the base rate plus 0.75%, at our Parentâ€™s option. Interest accrues on ourParentâ€™s first lien term loan at LIBOR plus 3.25% or the base rate plus 2.50%,at our Parentâ€™s option. Interest accrues on our Parentâ€™s second lien term loanat LIBOR plus 5.50%. Interest accrues on our Parentâ€™s third lien term loan atLIBOR plus 8.00%. The base rate is the greater of the prime rate or the federalfunds effective rate plus 0.5%. Our Parentâ€™s revolving credit facility and firstlien term loan mature on November 14, 2010, our Parentâ€™s second lien term loanmatures on November 14, 2011 and our Parentâ€™s third lien term loan matures onJune 9, 2012. The borrowings incurred under our Parentâ€™s credit facilities within the pasttwelve months were used for capital expenditures and working capital."

At June 30, 2007, outstanding borrowingsunder our revolving credit facility totaled approximately $46.8 million. Weincurred the debt under our revolving credit facility principally to meet ourcapital expenditure requirements and other working capital needs. We will haveapproximately $6.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving creditfacility after the closing of this offering, leaving us with approximately$69.0 million available for future borrowings under such revolving creditfacility.  We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by theselling stockholder."

For purposes of presentation, the full amount    available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us    immediately following the offering.(4)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these      items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may      incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in      connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon      the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not anticipate      any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the      current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent      they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be      deducted from our excess working capital.In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Staton Bell Blank CheckLLC has committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchaseprice of $6,000,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a privateplacement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We willnot pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the insiderwarrants. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed inthe trust fund described below.$239,200,000, or $275,200,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $6,000,000 we will receive from thesale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Smith Barney,maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, astrustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts andcommissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters haveagreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate abusiness combination and have waived their right to receive such payment uponour liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The fundsheld in trust will be invested only in United States ""government securities""within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certainconditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the InvestmentCompany Act. Except with respect to interest income that may be released to usof (i) up to $2,450,000 to fund expenses related to investigating and selectinga target business and our other working capital requirements and (ii) anyadditional amounts we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations, theproceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of thecompletion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held inthe trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a targetbusiness with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid asconsideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to financeoperations of the target business.The payment to Bell & Staton, Inc., an affiliate of Daniel C. Staton and Marc H.Bell, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative servicesincluding office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement isbeing agreed to by Bell & Staton, Inc. for our benefit and is not intended toprovide Daniel C. Staton and Marc H. Bell compensation in lieu of a salary. Webelieve, based on rents and fees for similar services in the South Floridametropolitan area, that the fee charged by Bell & Staton, Inc. is at least asfavorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Thisarrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or thedistribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the$7,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder's,consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers,directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for anyservices they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the businesscombination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, suchindividuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurredby them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as searching for andidentifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence onsuitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to andfrom the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businessesto examine their operations or meet with their representatives or owners.Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held intrust and currently allocated to ""Legal, accounting and other third-partyexpenses attendant to the search for target businesses and to the due diligenceinvestigation, structuring and negotiation of a business combination,"" ""Duediligence of prospective target businesses by our officers, directors andinitial stockholders"" and ""Working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&Oinsurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation obligations and reserves.""Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to thosepersons after a business combination.Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the netproceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for abusiness combination is estimated to be no more than $50,000. In addition,interest earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $2,450,000, may bereleased to us to fund our working capital requirements. We will also beentitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust account releasedto us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to use the excessworking capital (approximately $870,000) for miscellaneous expenses, directorand officer liability insurance premiums and general corporate purposes, withthe balance of $1,630,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence,legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating businesscombinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of anyout-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial stockholders in connection withactivities on our behalf as described below. We believe these funds will besufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could usea portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees forfinancing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a targetbusiness or as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision (a provision inletters of intent designed to keep target businesses from ""shopping"" around fortransactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such targetbusinesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, althoughwe do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter ofintent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a targetbusiness, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop""provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific businesscombination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture ofsuch funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in ournot having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting duediligence with respect to, potential target businesses.The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the eventthat our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of suchproceeds within the above described categories.We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business andto pay our expenses relating thereto. Additionally, while we are not obligatedto engage any of the underwriters to assist us with locating a target businessfollowing this offering, we are not restricted from doing so. If we did, we maypay a fee to them for their services for assisting us in locating a targetbusiness. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trustaccount which are not used to consummate a business combination will bedisbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceedsnot expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the targetbusiness. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of waysincluding continuing or expanding the target business' operations, for strategicacquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or newproducts. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses orfinders' fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our businesscombination if the funds available to us outside of the trust account wereinsufficient to cover such expenses.To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will paythe costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.If such funds are insufficient, Staton Bell Blank Check LLC has agreed toadvance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currentlyanticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seekrepayment of such expenses. If Staton Bell Blank Check LLC is unable to satisfythe foregoing obligations, Daniel C. Staton, Marc H. Bell and Maria BalodimasStaton have agreed to be personally liable in its place.Staton Bell Blank Check LLC has advanced to us $250,000, which was used to pay aportion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above forthe SEC registration fee, the NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of theAmerican Stock Exchange listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the earlier of July 18, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from thetrust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a businesscombination is not consummated during that time.A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) onlyin the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts suchshares into cash in connection with a business combination which the publicstockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstanceswill a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in thetrust account.Upon the consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters willbe entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust accountattributable to the underwriters' discounts and commissions held in the trustaccount."

We have granted the underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days afterthe date of this prospectus to purchase, from time to time, in whole or in part,up to an aggregate of 750,000 shares at the initial public offering price lessunderwriting discounts and commissions. This option may be exercised if theunderwriters sell more than 5,000,000 shares in connection with this offering.To the extent that the underwriters exercise this option in full, we estimatethat the net proceeds to us from such exercise will be approximately$11.2 million.We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, includingworking capital, the expansion of our sales and marketing organizations,acceleration of our research and development efforts, expansion of ourmanufacturing capabilities and purchases of capital equipment. We anticipate wewill also use a portion of the proceeds in acquisitions of businesses, productsand technologies that are complementary to our business. Although we have fromtime to time evaluated possible acquisitions, we currently have no definitivecommitments or agreements to make any acquisitions, and we cannot assure youthat we will make any acquisitions in the future. Until we use the net proceedsfrom this offering, we intend to invest the funds in United States governmentsecurities and other short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instrumentsor high-grade corporate notes. Management will have significant flexibility inapplying the net proceeds from this offering. We will use a portion of theoffering proceeds to repay a $7.0 million promissory note and all accruedinterest payable to DP1, LLC. The promissory note accrues interest at a rateequal to 2% every 30 days and matures on December 27, 2007. The proceeds fromthe borrowing under the promissory note were used to finance the acquisition ofPureTech Systems Inc. in October 2007."

In particular, we plan to grow in cities such as Beijing and Shanghaithrough acquisitions, where local regulations prohibit the opening of newdrugstores within certain distances of an existing drugstore, and in cities thatare close to our distribution centers in order to gain operational efficienciesin distribution and leverage our information technology infrastructure over abroader store base. We are not currently engaged in any discussions ornegotiations for any acquisitions. The foregoing use of our net proceeds from this offering represents our currentintentions based upon our present plans and business condition. The amounts andtiming of any expenditure will vary depending on the amount of cash generated byour operations, competitive developments and the rate of growth, if any, of ourbusiness. Accordingly, our management will have significant discretion in theallocation of the net proceeds we will receive from this offering. Depending onfuture events and other changes in the business climate, we may determine at alater time to use the net proceeds for different purposes. Pending their use, weintend to place our net proceeds in short-term bank deposits. In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, as an offshore holding company, weare permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to ourconsolidated PRC entities only through loans or capital contributions and toother entities only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicablegovernment registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-companyloans to our consolidated PRC entities or make additional capital contributionsto our consolidated PRC entities to fund their capital expenditures or workingcapital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these governmentregistrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

to an increase in the number of shares of   common stock outstanding after the stock offering which could occur due to an   increase in the maximum of the independent valuation as a result of regulatory       considerations, demand for the shares, or changes in market conditions or   general economic conditions following the commencement of the stock offering.         The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the stockoffering may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses wouldincrease if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of commonstock not purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering.Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts willnot result in the receipt of new funds for investment but will result in areduction of Northfield Bankâ€™s deposits. In all instances, Northfield Bank willreceive at least 50% of the net proceeds of the stock offering.   We are undertaking the stock offering at this time in order to increase ourcapital and have the capital resources available to expand our business. Forfurther information, see â€œManagementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operationsâ€”Business Strategy.â€ù The stock offeringproceeds will increase our capital resources and the amount of funds availableto us for lending and other investment purposes.

The loan that will be used to fund the purchases by the employee stockownership plan will accrue interest.   Northfield Bank intends to invest the net proceeds it receives from the stockoffering initially in short-term, liquid investments. Over time, Northfield Bankmay use the proceeds that it receives from the stock offering as follows:â€¢ to expand its retail banking franchise by establishing de novo branches, by   acquiring existing branches, or by acquiring other financial institutions or  other financial services companies, although no material acquisitions are     specifically being considered at this time;                                  â€¢ to fund new loans;                                                           â€¢ to support new products and services;                                        â€¢ to invest in securities; and                                                 â€¢ for general corporate purposes.                                                The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on changes ininterest rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financialservices industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, theattractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overallmarket conditions. We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to ourperformance in recent years until we are able to utilize effectively theadditional capital raised in the stock offering. Until we can increase our netinterest income and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity toremain below the industry average, which may negatively affect the value of ourcommon stock."

We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to ourperformance in recent years until we are able to utilize effectively theadditional capital raised in the stock offering. Until we can increase our netinterest income and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity toremain below the industry average, which may negatively affect the value of ourcommon stock."

This loan is payable on July 16, 2008 and may be        prepaid by us, in whole or in part at any time, at our election, out of funds    not placed in the trust account or interest earned on the trust account that     is released to us to cover our operating expenses.                           (2) The underwriters have agreed to defer $3,750,000 of their underwriting           discount (or $4,312,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full),      which equals 3.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering, until consummation     of a business combination. Upon consummation of a business combination such      deferred discount will be released to the underwriters and any public            stockholders exercising their conversion rights out of the proceeds of this      offering held in the trust account. The underwriters will not be entitled to     any interest accrued on the deferred discount.                               (3) Assumes an estimated monthly rent of $11,667 for two years in respect of         office space which we expect to lease following the consummation of this         offering.                                                                    (4) Working capital includes salaries of administrative personnel, electric,         utilities and telephone costs and similar expenses, none of which is expected    to be paid to any of our affiliates. We do not expect to incur any other         administrative expenses.                                                     (5) The maximum amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain         constant at $125,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. We currently       estimate that we would require approximately $50,000 to $75,000 to implement     our stockholder approved plan of dissolution and distribution in the event we    do not consummate a business combination. To the extent such funds are not       available, Pecksland Partners, LLC has agreed to advance us the necessary        funds and has agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses, though it has      not taken a reserve for this possibility and there can be no assurance that      it will be able to meet its obligations under this agreement.                We will place $123,125,000, or $141,125,000 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full, of the net proceeds of this offering and theprivate placement in a trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americasmaintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. Theproceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of thecompletion of a business combination and our liquidation. We expect to use(i) $3,750,000 of the proceeds held in the trust account to pay the deferredunderwriting discount (or $4,312,500 if the over-allotment option is exercisedin full), (ii) up to $2,125,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (netof taxes payable on such interest), plus $125,000 not held in the trust accountto cover our operating expenses and (iii) the remaining proceeds held in thetrust account as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business withwhich we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as considerationto the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of thetarget business or to effect other acquisitions, including the payment of anyfindersâ€™ fees or other similar costs or expenses as well as the expenses ofidentifying and evaluating such target business, the selection of such targetbusiness, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the businesscombination, or for any such other purpose, as may be determined by our board ofdirectors at that time.We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performedby some or all of our officers and directors and our senior advisor and mayinclude engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Suchmarket research firms and/or third party consultants will be paid out of thefunds allocated for due diligence. Our officers and directors and our senioradvisor will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospectivetarget businesses, but will be reimbursed from the funds allocated for duediligence investigation for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses)incurred in connection with such due diligence activities attendant toconsummating a business transaction. To the extent funds not held in the trustaccount and up to $2,125,000 of interest income (net of taxes) released to usfrom the trust account are insufficient to reimburse management forout-of-pocket expenses, the obligation to repay advances by management may beassumed by the resulting entity following, and subject to, the consummation of abusiness combination.On July 16, 2007, our principal stockholder, Pecksland Partners, LLC, which isan affiliate of our officers, advanced to us a total of $210,000, which was usedto pay a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan bears interest at arate of 5% per annum, compounded semiannually, and is due on July 16, 2008. Thisloan may be prepaid by us in whole or in part at any time at our election. Weanticipate that this loan will be repaid, at our election, out of the proceedsof this offering not being placed in the trust account and interest on the trustaccount that is released to us to pay our expenses.We may use a portion of the working capital, including any interest released tous from the trust account, to make a deposit, down payment or fund a â€œno-shopâ€ùprovision with respect to a particular proposed business combination, althoughwe do not have any current intention to do so. The amount that would be used asa down payment or lock-up payment would be determined based on the terms of thespecific business combination. If we are ultimately required to forfeit suchfunds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to suchpayment or otherwise), we would have less funds available to us to conduct duediligence and pay other expenses related to finding another suitable businesscombination and might be unable to complete a business combination withoutborrowing funds. If we were unable to secure additional financing, we would mostlikely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and wouldbe forced to liquidate. We do not anticipate paying findersâ€™ fees or othersimilar payments prior to the consummation of a business combination and anysuch payments would be made only in connection with the consummation of thebusiness combination.Under the tabular disclosure of â€œUse of Net Proceeds Not Held in Trust, and Upto $2,125,000 of the Interest Earned on Our Trust Account (Net of Taxes Payable)That May Be Released to Us to Cover Our Operating Expensesâ€ù we have includedestimates of the amount of expenses that we are likely to incur in connectionwith: (1) legal, accounting and other expenses incurred in connection with abusiness combination; (2) legal and accounting fees relating to SEC reportingobligations and (3) rent for office space. As the amounts are estimates, ourboard may determine that it is advisable that the amount of â€œworking capital tocover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, potential deposits, down paymentsor funding of a â€˜no-shopâ€™ provision in connection with a business combinationand reserves including for costs of dissolution and liquidation, if necessary,â€ùas provided for under the tabular disclosure of â€œUse of Net Proceeds Not Held inTrust, and Up to $2,125,000 of the Interest Earned on Our Trust Account (Net ofTaxes Payable) That May Be Released to Us to Cover Our Operating Expensesâ€ù maybe increased or decreased to the extent that the actual amount of legal,accounting and other expenses and rent for office space described above differsfrom the estimated amounts that are provided for in the table.To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trustaccount as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to financethe operations of the target business or to acquire other businesses.The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only inUnited States â€œgovernment securities,â€ù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) ofthe Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less so thatwe are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.Interest income, net of taxes payable with respect to such interest, of up to$2,125,000 on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the trustaccount to fund a portion of our working capital and other requirements.Following completion of this offering, we believe the funds available to us fromoutside the trust account, together with interest income (net of taxes on suchincome) of up to $2,125,000 on the balance of the trust account to be releasedto us for working capital and other requirements, will be sufficient to allow usto operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming a business combination isnot completed during that time. However, there is no assurance that the netproceeds not held in trust will be sufficient to cover the expenses attendant toconsummating a business combination.No compensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s and consulting fees) will bepaid by us, Pecksland Partners, LLC or any of our respective affiliates to anyof our officers or directors or our senior advisor, or any of their affiliates,for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of a business combination. Further, our code of ethics prohibits our officers, directors and employees from accepting any such commissions, compensation, finderâ€™s fees or consulting fees from any prospective target business. However,our officers and directors and our senior advisor and our affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account or released to us from the trust account described above, we would not reimburse such out-of-pocket expenses unless we consummate a business combination. It is possible that certain of our officers and directors and our senior advisor may be employed or retained by a target business after the business combination in some capacity. However, since the role of any of those individuals after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) onlyin the event of our liquidation of the trust account if an initial businesscombination is not consummated within the 24 month time period specified in thisprospectus, pursuant to the provisions of our amended and restated certificateof incorporation, or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert suchshares into cash in connection with a business combination which such publicstockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstanceswill a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in thetrust account."

These          borrowings bear interest at rates equal to the prime rate per annum (7.75%    at September 25, 2007) plus between 0.25% and 1.0% and are secured by a       pledge of certain of our equipment and all of our accounts receivable,        investment property and financial assets. As of September 25, 2007, a total   of $2.3 million was outstanding under these arrangements and was payable in   specified amounts from time to time through July 2010. No prepayment charge   would be incurred upon our repayment of these borrowings following the        completion of this offering.                                                  â€¢  Under arrangements with Oracle Credit Corporation, we borrowed $215,000 in    February 2005 in connection with our purchase of certain software from        Oracle. These borrowings bear interest at the implicit rate of 9.3% per       annum and are not secured. At September 25, 2007, a total of $40,000 was      outstanding under these arrangements and was payable in quarterly   installments, ending in March 2008. No prepayment charge would be incurred    upon our repayment of these borrowings following the completion of this       offering.                                                                   Based on the amounts of the borrowings outstanding as of September 25, 2007, wewould apply $2.3 million of our net proceeds to pay in full our current andlong-term indebtedness under these arrangements. We intend to use the balance of our net proceeds for working capital and othergeneral corporate purposes, which may include financing our growth, developingnew features and services, and funding capital expenditures. In addition, theother principal purposes for this offering are to:     â€¢  create a public market for our common stock;                                      â€¢  facilitate our future access to the public capital markets;                       â€¢  increase our visibility in our markets;                                           â€¢  provide liquidity for our existing stockholders;                                  â€¢  improve the effectiveness of our equity compensation plans in attracting          and retaining key employees; and                                                  â€¢  enhance our ability to acquire other businesses, technologies or products.  We have not yet determined with any certainty the manner in which we willallocate the net proceeds. The amount and timing of these expenditures will varydepending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated by ouroperations, competitive and technological developments, and the rate of growth,if any, of our business. We may use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire businesses, technologies andproducts that will expand the feature set of our on-demand service, provideaccess to new markets or clients, or otherwise complement our existingoperations. We have no agreement with respect to any acquisition, although weassess opportunities on an ongoing basis and from time to time have discussionswith other companies about potential transactions. We cannot assure you that wewill make any acquisitions in the future. Our management will have significant flexibility in applying our net proceeds.Further, changing business conditions and unforeseen circumstances could causethe actual amounts used for these purposes to vary from our estimates. Pendingthe uses described above, we intend to invest our net proceeds inU.S. government securities and other short-term, investment-grade,interest-bearing instruments."

The term loan was initially incurred in the amount of $115 million onApril 22, 2005 to finance our recapitalization. In 2006, we borrowed under ourrevolving credit facility primarily to repay a liability owed to the sellingshareholders in the recapitalization and finance part of the CSSI acquisition.The principal amount of the term loan was increased by $100 million on April 28,2006 to finance the repayment of our 8% subordinated debentures due 2015. As ofOctober 15, 2007, the interest rate was 7.38% for the term loan and 8.00% on aweighted average basis for the revolving credit facility. The term loan matureson April 22, 2011, and the revolving credit facility matures on April 22, 2010.After application of approximately $25.0 million of the net proceeds from thisoffering to repay all indebtedness outstanding under our revolving creditfacility and approximately $17.6 million of the net proceeds from this offeringto repay a portion of our indebtedness under the term loan of our creditagreement, we expect that approximately $193.3 million will be outstanding underour term loan. Affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, J.P. MorganSecurities Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, underwriters for thisoffering, are lenders and will receive a portion of the net proceeds used torepay debt under our credit agreement."

As of September 30, 2007, the amountoutstanding on the Tako Ventures line of credit was $8.0 million. The interestrate on the line of credit is equal to the prime rate plus 1% per annum, or8.75% as of September 30, 2007, and the maturity date is February 28, 2008.

Once a fundamental change in the Companyoccurs we will be required to file additional post-effective amendments to theregistration statement before registered shares can be delivered. In December2007, seven (7) Selling Stockholders exercised their Class A Warrants at thereduced exercise price of $1.00 per share, and such Selling Stockholders ortheir designees received 160,600 shares of registered common stock and theCompany received proceeds of $160,600 in the aggregate.  In addition, twofounders exercised Class A Warrants granted to them outside of this prospectus,which were exercised at the reduced price of $1.00 per share for 4,646 shares ofunregistered common stock, resulting in $4,636 in proceeds received by theCompany.  In February 2007, the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of its commonstock to 35 persons for $50,000 pursuant to Regulation D under the SecuritiesAct. The sale of such shares was not specifically intended to raise financingsince the funds raised were de minimis and intended to cover formation costs andthe costs of this registration statement. The financing was intended to getrelatives and business associates of management involved in our business. TheFebruary 2007 Private Placement was primarily intended to establish ashareholder base whose shares could be registered in order to create a publicmarket for our securities.

Once a fundamental change in the Companyoccurs we will be required to file additional post-effective amendments to theregistration statement before registered shares can be delivered. In December2007, seven (7) Selling Stockholders exercised their Class A Warrants at thereduced exercise price of $1.00 per share, and such Selling Stockholders ortheir designees received 160,600 shares of registered common stock and theCompany received proceeds of $160,600 in the aggregate.  In addition, twofounders exercised Class A Warrants granted to them outside of this prospectus,which were exercised at the reduced price of $1.00 per share for 4,646 shares ofunregistered common stock, resulting in $4,636 in proceeds received by theCompany.  In February 2007, the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of its commonstock to 35 persons for $50,000 pursuant to Regulation D under the SecuritiesAct. The sale of such shares was not specifically intended to raise financingsince the funds raised were de minimis and intended to cover formation costs andthe costs of this registration statement. The financing was intended to getrelatives and business associates of management involved in our business.

Upon the consummation of a business           combination, such deferred discount shall be released to the underwriters and    then only with respect to those units as to which the component shares have      not been redeemed. If we do not complete a business combination and the trust    account is liquidated, these amounts will be distributed to our public           stockholders.                                                                (4) If the over-allotment option is exercised in full, we will not be permitted      to draw on the interest income earned on the trust account until $2,167,500      (or a lesser amount if less than the fully over-allotment option is              exercised, pro rata based on the amount of the over-allotment option             exercised) of interest shall have been earned on the trust account with the      resulting effective that there shall be a minimum of $9.97 per unit held in      the trust account.                                                           (5) We expect to fund our operating expenses from interest income earned on the      trust account and the initial $150,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust     account. An aggregate of $3,700,000 of the interest income earned on the         trust account will be released to us to fund our working capital                 requirements; provided, however, if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option      is exercised in full, we will not be permitted to draw such amounts until        $2,167,500 (or a lesser amount if less than the full over-allotment option is    exercised) of interest shall have been earned on the trust account with the      resulting effect that there shall be a minimum of $9.97 per share held in the    trust account. We shall not be entitled to draw upon the interest income         earned on the $15,750,000 in deferred underwriting compensation ($18,112,500     if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), which will be payable to     the underwriters, net of taxes payable, if a business combination is             consummated, but which will be forfeited by the underwriters if a business       combination is not consummated.                                              (6) In the event our stockholders approve the extended period, we shall be           obligated to pay up to an additional $45,000 in administrative fees pursuant     to our agreement with our sponsor.                                           Of the net proceeds of this offering and the private placement, an aggregate of$448,700,000 (or $516,005,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full)including (i) $15,600,000 from the purchase of insider warrants and(ii) $15,750,000 (or $18,112,500 if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option isexercised in full) of the underwritersâ€™ deferred underwriting compensation willbe deposited into the trust account at Banc of America Investment Services,Inc., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, NewYork, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account untilthe earlier of the completion of a business combination or as part of anyliquidation of our trust account. To the extent the trust account earns interestor we are deemed to have earned income in connection therewith, we will bepermitted to seek disbursements from the trust account to pay any federal,state, local or franchise tax obligations related thereto. However, to theextent the over-allotment is exercised in full and funds held in trust are lessthat $9.97 per share, the first $2,167,500 of interest earned on amounts held inthe trust account (net of taxes payable) will be used to bring the amount heldin trust up to an aggregate of $516,005,000 ($9.97 per share). The proceeds heldin the trust account (exclusive of any funds held for the benefit of theunderwriters or used to pay public stockholders who have exercised theirredemption rights) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a targetbusiness with which we ultimately complete a business combination or, if thereare insufficient funds not held in trust, to pay other expenses relating to suchtransaction such as reimbursement to insiders for out-of-pocket expenses, thirdparty due diligence expenses or potential finders fees, in each case only uponthe consummation of a business combination. In the event there are fundsremaining in the trust account after satisfaction of all of such obligations, such funds may be used to finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of directors at that time. Allamounts held in the trust account will be released on closing of our initial business combination with a target business having a fair market value of at least 80.0% of our net assets held in the trust account (exclusive of theunderwritersâ€™ deferred underwriting compensation plus interest thereon held inthe trust account) at the time of the acquisition, subject to a majority of ourpublic stockholders voting in favor of the business combination and less than40.0% of the public stockholders voting against the business combination andelecting to exercise their redemption rights on a cumulative basis.We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $7,500 to United Refining, Inc., oursponsor, for office space and general and administrative services, including butnot limited to receptionist, secretarial and general office services. Thisagreement commences on the date of this prospectus and shall continue until theearliest to occur of: (i) the consummation of a business combination and(ii) the date on which we cease our corporate existence in accordance with ouramended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our sponsor and certain ofits affiliates share office space and share the cost of secretarial, reception,telecommunication, equipment, supplies, and such other office-related items asthey deem appropriate at a cost of approximately $80,000 per month. As we expectour activities in seeking and consummating a business combination will requireuse of a portion of the office space and these various services, we have agreedto pay 9.4% of such cost, or $7,500 per month, with the balance being theobligation of our sponsor or such affiliates.We intend to use the $150,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account,plus $3,700,000 of interest income earned on the trust account, for duediligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition includinginvestment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring andnegotiating business combination, as well as a possible down payment, reversebreak up fees (a provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to thetarget company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up orâ€œno-shopâ€ù provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep targetbusinesses from â€œshoppingâ€ù around for transactions with other companies on termsmore favorable to such target businesses), if necessary, to bear the costs ofliquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a business combination byDecember 11, 2009 or June 11, 2010 in the event the stockholders approve theextended period. While we do not have any current intention to use these fundsas a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provision with respect to a particularproposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intentwhere we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, theamount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a â€œno-shopâ€ù provisionwould be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination andthe amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not havingsufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence withrespect to, potential target businesses. In addition to the use of fundsdescribed above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees toconsultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We believe thatthe interest income will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses.To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or inpart as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event thatindebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as considerationto effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account whichare not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to thecombined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, beused as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third partyindebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors would not bepersonally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness.We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with abusiness combination, either because the consideration for the businesscombination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we financea portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. Insuch event, the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other netproceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations, which may includethe target business(es) that we acquire on the business combination, to effectother acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, among other things, for directorand officer compensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates,to finance the operations of the target business, to make other acquisitions andto pursue our growth strategy.In the event that third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of theexpenses of this offering, our sponsor would be liable for the repayment of suchindebtedness. Our sponsor has advanced to us a total of $300,000, which was usedto pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line itemsabove for SEC registration fees, FINRA registration fees, AMEX filing fees andlegal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interestupon the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of theproceeds of this offering.The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trust accountagent only in United States â€œgovernment securitiesâ€ù within the meaning ofSection 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions underRule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Although therate of interest to be earned on the trust account will fluctuate through theduration of the trust account, and although we are unable to state the exactamount of time it will take to complete a business combination, we anticipatethe interest that will accrue on the trust account, even at an interest rate of4.0% (up to $3,700,000 interest income, net of taxes payable on all interestincome earned on the trust account), during the time it will take to identify atarget and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our workingcapital requirements. While we cannot assure you the trust account will yieldthis rate, we believe such rate is representative of that which we may receive.By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend toavoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940. Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required tocomply with the requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distributethe trust account to holders of our common stock sold in this offering untilafter our existence terminates by operation of law on December 11, 2009 or June11, 2010 in the event the stockholders approve the extended period and,consequently, we may be deemed to be an investment company and thus required tocomply with such act. The interest income derived from investment of these netproceeds during this period that is not otherwise returned to publicstockholders who vote against a proposal to approve the extended period or abusiness combination will be used to defray our general and administrativeexpenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws andregulations, including associated professional fees, until a businesscombination is completed. We do not believe that the fees and expenses for duediligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, down payment, lock-up or otheractivities related to this offering or our business combination will exceed$3,850,000 in the aggregate, comprised of $150,000 of net proceeds not held inthe trust account plus up to $3,700,000 of interest income earned on the trustaccount and released to us to fund our working capital. Based upon theexperience of the members of our board and consultation with them regarding areasonable budget for consummating a transaction of this kind and nature, and areview of budgets publicly disclosed by blank-check companies, we determinedthat this was an appropriate approximation of the expenses. If costs are higherthan expected we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, orconduct due diligence with respect to, any potential target businesses. In suchcase, we would need to obtain additional funds from our initial stockholders oranother source to continue operations. We believe that, upon consummation ofthis offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at leastthe next 24 months or 30 months in the event the stockholders approve theextended period, assuming that a business combination is not consummated duringthat time.Other than the $7,500 per month general and administrative services feesdescribed above and the reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred inconnection with a business combination, no compensation of any kind (includingfinders, consulting or other similar fees or the issuance of any securities ofthe company) will be paid to any of our sponsor, existing officers, directors orstockholder, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services that theyrender in order to effectuate, or in connection with the consummation of thebusiness combination. However, such persons will receive reimbursement, subjectto board approval, for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connectionwith activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations, as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held inthe trust account and currently allocated in the above table to â€œLegal, accounting and other expenses,â€ù â€œDue diligence of prospective target businessesâ€ù and â€œWorking capital.â€ù Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, ifany, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.A public stockholder (but not our existing stockholder with respect to anyshares of our common stock owned by it immediately before this offering orunderlying the insider warrants purchased in the private placement) will beentitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned onsuch stockholderâ€™s portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable andamounts disbursed for working capital purposes described elsewhere in thisprospectus) only in the event of our liquidation of the trust account as part ofour liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination, or if suchpublic stockholder redeems his shares of common stock into cash in connectionwith a proposal to approve the extended period or a business combination thatthe public stockholder voted against and which we actually approve andconsummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any rightor interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Our existing stockholder isnot entitled to redeem any of its shares of common stock acquired prior to thisoffering, in this offering or after this offering into a pro rata share of thetrust account.Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will beentitled to receive their deferred underwriting compensation plus any accruedinterest thereon, net of taxes payable. In the event that we are unable toconsummate a business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate thetrust account, the underwriters have agreed that: (i) they will forfeit anyrights or claims to such deferred underwriting compensation plus any accruedinterest thereon; and (ii) that the deferred underwriting compensation will bedistributed on a pro-rata basis among the public stockholders along with anyaccrued interest thereon."

We will not receive any proceeds from the saleof shares of common stock by the selling stockholders.The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital tosupport our operations, create a public market for our common stock andfacilitate our future access to the public equity markets.We anticipate using approximately $9.0 million of the net proceeds to us fromthis offering for the repayment of all principal and accrued interest owed underRF Magicâ€™s credit facility with Horizon and under Entropicâ€™s credit facilitywith Horizon and Silicon Valley Bank.â€¢  For RF Magicâ€™s credit facility with Horizon, we anticipate repaying          approximately $7.0 million in principal and accrued interest. We used the    proceeds of this indebtedness for working capital and general corporate      purposes. Interest accrues on the outstanding indebtedness at a rate of the    greater of 11.9% or the LIBOR rate plus 5.33% per annum. For $5.0 million of    principal borrowed, monthly interest only payments are payable through    November 2007. Beginning in December 2007, principal and interest payments    are payable over 30 months on the outstanding principal. For the other $2.0    million of principal borrowed, monthly interest only payments are payable    through June 2008. Beginning in June 2008, principal and interest payments    are payable over 30 months on the outstanding principal.                                                                â€¢  For Entropicâ€™s credit facility with Horizon and Silicon Valley Bank, we      anticipate repaying approximately $2.0 million in principal and accrued      interest.

Interest accrues on the outstanding indebtedness   at a rate of the greater of 11.85% or 11.85% plus the difference between the    LIBOR rate and 5.32%. For both tranches of $1.0 million of principal    borrowed, monthly interest only payments are payable through March 2008.    Beginning in April 2008, principal and interest payments are payable over 30    months on the outstanding principal.         Under both credit facilities, we have calculated accrued interest to be paidbased on an assumed repayment date of January 1, 2008. The actual amount ofaccrued interest will depend upon the actual date of repayment which isanticipated to take place shortly after the closing date of this offering.Moreover, a prepayment penalty equaling 1.0% of the principal amount thenoutstanding under the RF Magic credit facility ($70,000 based on the principalamounts set forth above) and 2.0% of the principal amount then outstanding underthe Entropic credit facility ($40,000 based on the principal amounts set forthabove) will apply if the net proceeds received by Horizon and Silicon ValleyBank as selling stockholders in this offering do not exceed a threshold amountspecified in the applicable loan and security agreements. Since the initialpublic offering price is $6.00 per share, the prepayment penalty under the RFMagic credit facility will apply but the prepayment penalty under the Entropiccredit facility will not apply. We intend to use net proceeds to us from thisoffering to pay the prepayment penalty under the RF Magic credit facility.Apart from the repayment of outstanding indebtedness as described above, wecurrently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds to us from thisoffering, nor have we performed studies or made preliminary decisions withrespect to the best use of the capital resources resulting from this offering.We anticipate using the balance of the net proceeds to us from this offering forworking capital and general corporate purposes. In addition, we may use aportion of the net proceeds to us from this offering to acquire or licenseproducts, technologies or businesses, but we currently have no agreements orcommitments relating to material acquisitions or licenses. Accordingly, ourmanagement will have broad discretion in the application of our net proceedsfrom this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of ourmanagement regarding the application of these proceeds.Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds to us from this offeringin short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-gradeinstruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of theU.S. government."

These advances will be repaid out    of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account upon      consummation of this offering.                                               (3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of    these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.                  (4) The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in the trust account      will remain constant at $50,000 even if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment is      exercised. In addition, $2.5 million, or approximately $2.88 million if the      underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of interest income     earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us to       pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of presentation, the      full amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds         available to us immediately following the offering.                          (5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these       items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may        incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in        connection with negotiating and structuring an initial business combination      based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not       anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than                fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which           fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific       category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     A total of $249.4 million (or $286.1 million if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full), of the net proceeds from this offering, including$12.5 million (or approximately $14.4 million if the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discountsand commissions and the proceeds of the private placement of the sponsorâ€™swarrants described in this prospectus, will be placed in the trust account atJPMorgan Chase NY Bank with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, astrustee. Except for a portion of the interest income that may be released to us,the proceeds held in the trust account will not be released until the earlier ofthe consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. Allamounts held in the trust account that are not paid to public stockholders whoelect to exercise their conversion rights or released to us as interest incomewill be released on closing of our initial business combination with one or moretarget businesses which collectively have a fair market value of at least 80% ofthe balance in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts andcommissions of $12.5 million or approximately $14.4 million if the underwritersâ€™over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the time of such initial businesscombination, subject to a majority of our public stockholders voting in favor ofthe initial business combination and less than 30% of the public stockholderselecting their conversion rights and subject to such deferred underwritingdiscount and commission having been paid to the underwriters. On release offunds from the trust account and after payment of the conversion price to anypublic stockholders who exercise their conversion rights, the underwriters willreceive their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, and the remainingfunds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of thepurchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial combinationoccurs. In no other circumstances will the funds in the trust account bereleased to us. If the initial business combination is paid for using stock ordebt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account togeneral corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operationsof acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due onindebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fundthe purchase of other companies, or for working capital.We have agreed to pay JLJ Partners, an affiliate of Lawrence S. Stroll, Joel J.Horowitz and John D. Idol, an aggregate of $10,000 per month for office space,administrative services and secretarial support. This arrangement is beingprovided by JLJ Partners for our benefit and is not intended to provide Messrs.Stroll, Horowitz or Idol compensation in lieu of a salary or other remunerationbecause it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid by JLJ Partners willapproximate the monthly reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least asfavorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completionof an initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease payingthese monthly fees.We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performedby some or all of the members of our management team and may include engagingmarket research firms and/or third party consultants. Members of our managementteam, or their affiliates, will not receive any compensation for their duediligence of prospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for anyout-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection withsuch due diligence activities. Our audit committee will review and approve allexpense reimbursements and payments made to any founder or member of ourmanagement team or our or their respective affiliates and any expense reimbursements and payments to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors, with the interested director ordirectors abstaining from such review and approval.We believe that amounts not held in the trust account as well as the interestincome earned on the trust account balance released to us to pay any taxobligations and interest income of up to $2.5 million (or approximately$2.88 million if the underwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full)earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us will besufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated.This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertakenonly after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminaryagreement that addresses the terms of an initial business combination. However,if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence andnegotiating an initial business combination is less than the actual amountnecessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,availability and cost of which is currently not ascertainable. In this event, wecould seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments frommembers of our management team, but such members of our management team are notunder any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.If we complete an initial business combination, the out-of-pocket expensesincurred by members of our management team prior to such initial businesscombinationâ€™s closing will become an obligation of the post-combinationbusiness, assuming these out-of-pocket expenses have not been reimbursed priorto the closing. These expenses would be a liability of the post-combinationbusiness and would be treated in a manner similar to any other account payableof the combined business. Members of our management team may, as part of anysuch combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses.If the target businessâ€™ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could causeour management team to view such potential business combination unfavorably andresult in a conflict of interest.To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part asconsideration to effect an initial business combination, the proceeds held inthe trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used tofinance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds couldbe used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the targetbusinessâ€™ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research anddevelopment of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repayany operating expenses or findersâ€™ fees which we had incurred prior to thecompletion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside ofthe trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.As of the date of this prospectus, JLJ Partners has advanced to us an aggregateof $100,000 which was used to pay a portion of the SEC registration fee, FINRAfiling fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange fee andaccounting and legal fees and expenses of this offering referenced in the lineitems above. This advance is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at theearlier of August 8, 2008, or the consummation of this offering. The loan willbe repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trustaccount.The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and notimmediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only inUnited States â€˜â€˜government securitiesâ€™â€™ within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16)of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, orin money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgatedunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be aninvestment company under the Investment Company Act. Interest income earned onthe trust account balance may be released to us to pay any tax obligations andinterest income of up to $2.5 million (or approximately $2.88 million if theunderwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full) earned on the trustaccount balance may be released to us to fund a portion of our working capitalrequirements.Other than the fee for office space, administrative services and secretarialsupport described above, no compensation or fees of any kind (including finderâ€™sfees, consulting fees and other similar compensation) will be paid to ourfounders or members of our management team or any of our or their respectiveaffiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with theconsummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, members of our management team will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection withactivities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses andperforming due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest income of up to $2.5 million (or approximately $2.88 million if theunderwritersâ€™ over-allotment option is exercised in full) that is released to usfrom the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed byus prior to our consummation of an initial business combination. In the event aninitial business combination is consummated by us and irrespective of whethersuch persons remain associated with us, our audit committee and/or our Board ofDirectors may determine to reimburse such persons for such expenses. There is nolimit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us to such persons. Apublic stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account onlyin the event of our liquidation if we fail to complete an initial businesscombination within the allotted time or if the public stockholder seeks toconvert such shares into cash in connection with an initial business combinationthat the public stockholder voted against and that we actually complete. In noother circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of anykind in or to funds in the trust account.On completion of our initial business combination, the underwriters will receivethe deferred underwritersâ€™ discounts and commissions held in the trust account.If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee musttherefore distribute the balance in the trust account, the underwriters haveagreed (i) on our liquidation, to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferredunderwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued interest thereon,then in the trust account, and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to distributethe deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accruedinterest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, to the publicstockholders on a pro rata basis."

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from thisoffering as follows:â€¢ approximately $55 million for overseas expansion in Canada, the United States  and the Middle East;                                                                    â€¢ approximately $50 million for capital expenditures and expansion and   improvements of our production facilities in China;                                                                                         â€¢ approximately $18.5 million for the full repayment of our loans from UMW ACE   and $34.8 million for the repayment of a portion of our bank borrowings from   Agricultural Bank of China;                                                     â€¢ an undetermined amount for strategic investment in and acquisitions of   complementary businesses.

These loans were entered into in April, May and December 2005 and   February 2006 and have a term of five years. These loans were used to finance  the construction of our hot-rolling pipe line and threading plus 2%. In 2005,  2006 and the six months ended June 30, 2007, the average interest rate for our   long-term loan from UMW ACE was approximately 6.1%, 7.2% and 7.5%,   respectively.â€¢ As of June 30, 2007, we had outstanding balance of bank borrowings from  Agricultural Bank of China of $52.5 million. These loans were entered into in  June 2007 and have a term of two years. These loans were used to refinance a   portion of our existing long-term loans from UMW ACE. The interest rate for     these loans is the benchmark interest rate for loans of the same maturity   announced by the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China, or PBOC, less 10%, which initially   was 6.075%. The interest rate will be adjusted every six months in accordance  with the benchmark interest rate announced by the PBOC.                           The foregoing represents our intentions to use and allocate the net proceeds ofthis offering based upon our present plans and business conditions. We have notyet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and therefore cannot estimatethe amounts to be used for acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Theamounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending on the amount of cashgenerated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and therate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will havesignificant discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds we will receivefrom this offering. Depending on future events and other changes in the businessclimate, we may determine at a later time to use the net proceeds for differentpurposes. Pending their use, we intend to invest the proceeds in a variety ofcapital preservation instruments, including short-term, investment-grade,interest-bearing instruments.We will not use any proceeds from the sale of our ADSs to fund any activities orbusiness with any Sanctions Targets with respect to which U.S. persons or, asappropriate, foreign entities owned or controlled by U.S. persons, areprohibited by U.S. Economic Sanctions Laws from conducting such activities ortransacting such business."

These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of      this offering available to us.                                               (2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the     insider warrants.

In addition, $1,000,000 of       interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be          available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of     presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount of    net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.             In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our officers, directorsand special advisor have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for anaggregate purchase price of $1,600,000) from us. These purchases will take placeon a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of thisoffering. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to thepurchase of the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from thispurchase will be placed in the trust account described below.$47,684,000, or $54,979,400 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,600,000 we will receive from thesale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Jefferies &Company, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, NewYork, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discountsand commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwritershave agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate abusiness combination and have waived their right to receive such payment uponour liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The fundsheld in trust will be invested only in United States â€˜â€˜government securitiesâ€™â€™within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certainconditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the InvestmentCompany Act. Except with respect to interest income that may be released to usof (i) up to $1,000,000 to fund expenses related to investigating and selectinga target business and our other working capital requirements and (ii) anyadditional amounts we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations, theproceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of thecompletion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held inthe trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a targetbusiness with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid asconsideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to financeoperations of the target business.The payment to American Fund Advisors, an affiliate of Barry J. Gordon, Marc H.Klee and Alan J. Loewenstein, of a monthly fee of $8,000 is for general andadministrative services including office space, utilities and secretarialsupport. This arrangement is being agreed to by American Fund Advisors for ourbenefit and is not intended to provide Messrs. Gordon, Klee and Loewensteincompensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees forsimilar services in the New York metropolitan area, that the fee charged byAmerican Fund Advisors is at least as favorable as we could have obtained froman unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of abusiness combination or the distribution of the trust account to our publicstockholders. Other than the $8,000 per month administrative fee, nocompensation of any kind (including finderâ€™s, consulting or other similar fees)will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any oftheir affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order toeffectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the typeof transaction). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for anyout-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on ourbehalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business duediligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well astraveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospectivetarget businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenseswill be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated toâ€˜â€˜Legal, accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the search fortarget businesses and to the due diligence investigation, structuring andnegotiation of a business combination,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜Due diligence of prospective targetbusinesses by our officers, directors and existing stockholdersâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜Workingcapital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporatepurposes, liquidation obligations and reserves.â€™â€™ Since the role of presentmanagement after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability todetermine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after abusiness combination.Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the netproceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for abusiness combination will be approximately $150,000. In addition, interestearned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $1,000,000, may be releasedto us to fund our working capital requirements. We intend to use the excessworking capital (approximately $208,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $120,000), with the balance of $88,000 being held in reserve for tax payments and in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection withactivities on our behalf as described below. We will also be entitled to haveinterest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay anytax obligations that we may owe. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion ofthe funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us withour search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a â€˜â€˜no-shopâ€™â€™ provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from â€˜â€˜shoppingâ€™â€™ around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. Ifwe entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a â€˜â€˜no-shopâ€™â€™ provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available fundsat the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach orotherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searchingfor, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the eventthat our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of suchproceeds within the above described categories.We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business andto pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock isused in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, theproceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a businesscombination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with anyother net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance theoperations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in avariety of ways including continuing or expanding the target businessâ€™operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research anddevelopment of existing or new products. While we do not presently anticipateengaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specializein business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or otherindividuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finderâ€™s fee, consultingfee or other compensation to be determined in an armâ€™s-length negotiation basedon the terms of the transaction. Payment of finderâ€™s fees will be tied tocompletion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of thefunds held in the trust account. Accordingly, such funds could also be used torepay any findersâ€™ fees if the funds available to us outside of the trustaccount were insufficient to cover such expenses. Alternatively, to the extentwe use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including thefunds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, we would need toarrange third party financing to help fund the payment of such a finderâ€™s fee.We have not taken any steps to secure third party financing.To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will paythe costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.If such funds are insufficient, certain of our existing stockholders prior tothis offering have agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete suchliquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) andhave agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.Barry J. Gordon and Arthur H. Goldberg have advanced to us an aggregate of$100,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offeringreferenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing feeand a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans will bepayable without interest on the earlier of July 10, 2008 or the consummation ofthis offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offeringavailable to us for payment of offering expenses.We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficientavailable funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from thetrust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a businesscombination is not consummated during that time.A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) onlyin the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts suchshares into cash in connection with a business combination which the publicstockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstanceswill a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in thetrust account."
