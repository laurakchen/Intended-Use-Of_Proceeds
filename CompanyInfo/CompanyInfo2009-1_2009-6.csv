A common stock in this offering will be approximately $679.7 million, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we
estimate our net proceeds will be approximately $782.3 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to (i) repay in full 
approximately $597 million of the foreign intercompany notes payable to 
subsidiaries of BMS, and (ii) satisfy payables and other obligations owing to 
one or more subsidiaries of BMS that would have otherwise been forgiven or 
reduced in full. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
full, we intend to use the net proceeds to repay in full an interest free 
obligation owed to a subsidiary of BMS that would have otherwise been forgiven
or reduced in full. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option,
we will receive no benefit from the issuance of any shares of Class A common 
stock subject to the over-allotment option. If the over-allotment option is not
exercised or partly exercised, this obligation or the remaining part thereof 
will be forgiven or otherwise reduced in full.

The aggregate principal amount of these foreign intercompany notes is 
approximately $597 million, with the note relating to Indonesia being
$32 million, the note relating to Malaysia being $55 million,the note relating
to the Netherlands being $280 million and the note relating to the Philippines
being $230 million. Except for the principal amounts, the terms of each of 
these notes are substantially similar, and the rate of interest per annum on 
each note is equal to LIBOR plus 0.75%."

approximately $48.8 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the 
underwriters' option to purchase additional shares in this offering is 
exercised, our net proceeds will not change as the entire option will be 
comprised of shares from the selling stockholders. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling 
stockholders. 

We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds we will receive from this 
offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit agreement with 
Wells Fargo, which has a maturity date of January 15, 2011 and had an 
outstanding balance of $9.9 million and an interest rate of approximately 
3.0% as of February 28, 2009. 

We expect to use approximately $7.9 million to satisfy the federal, state and 
local withholding tax obligations of 10 of our key employees, including our 
named executive officers, relating to the ""net issuance"" of the stock grants 
we made to them on April 15, 2009. See ""Capitalization"" and ""Executive 
Compensation—Stock Grants"" for a description of these stock grants and tax 
payments. We withheld from each recipient's award a number of shares of our 
common stock equal to the dollar value of the recipient's federal, state and 
local withholding tax obligations relating to the ""net issuance"" of the stock 
grant and we will use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to pay to 
the appropriate taxing authorities an equivalent value in cash. 

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital and 
general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the proceeds to 
expand our current business through acquisitions or investments in other 
complementary businesses, products or technologies. We have no agreements or 
commitments with respect to any acquisitions at this time. We will have broad 
discretion in the way we use the net proceeds. 

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we intend 
to invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing 
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct 
or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to raise additional capital, 
create a public market for our common stock, allow us easier and quicker 
access to the public markets should we need more capital in the future, 
increase the profile and prestige of our company with existing and possible 
future customers, vendors and strategic partners, and make our stock more 
valuable and attractive to our employees and potential employees for 
compensation purposes."

intend to optionally convert their shares of Series A Convertible Preferred

talented employees by providing them with equity incentives and obtain 
additional capital. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering
for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and
funding possible future acquisitions.

We have not yet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and
therefore cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes
discussed above. The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary
depending on the amount of cash generated by our operations, and the
competitiveness and growth rate of our business. Accordingly, our
management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds 
we receive from this offering. Depending on future events and other
changes in the business climate, we may determine at a later time to use
the net proceeds for different purposes. Pending their use, we intend
to invest our net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments 
or bank deposits.

for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing
activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures. We 
may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or 
investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our
business. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to 
enter into any acquisitions or investments. Our management will have broad
discretion over the uses of the net proceeds in this offering. Pending these
uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term,
investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts,
certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government.

intended to facilitate our future access to public markets."

stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $100.5 
million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our 
common stock by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use a portion of our net proceeds from this offering to repay 
approximately $50.3 million of our outstanding long-term indebtedness of 
$93.9 million as of March 31, 2009 under our December 2005 credit facilities 
and to pay an earnout payment of up to $20.0 million. This earnout payment is 
calculated in accordance with a formula provided in an agreement with certain 
of our original stockholders and will be either $0, $10.0 million or $20.0 
million. If the closing price per share of our common stock on the expiration 
date of the lock-up agreements is less than $8.05 per share, the earnout 
payment would be $0. If the closing price per share of our common stock on 
the expiration date of the lock-up agreements is equal to or greater than 
$8.06 per share but less than $10.75 per share, the earnout payment would be 
$10.0 million. If the closing price per share of our common stock on the 
expiration date of the lock-up agreements is equal to or greater than $10.75 
per share, the earnout payment would be $20.0 million. As indicated elsewhere 
in this prospectus, we have assumed an earnout payment of $20.0 million based 
on our belief that the initial public offering price of $12.50 is a reasonable 
estimation of the closing price per share of our common stock on the 
expiration date of the lock-up agreements. The borrowings outstanding under 
our December 2005 credit facilities currently have a stated maturity of 
December 2011. The $68.9 million of borrowings outstanding at March 31, 2009 
under the first lien term loan bear interest at a per annum rate of 
three-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.50%, or 4.9% at March 31, 2009, and the 
$25.0 million of borrowings outstanding at March 31, 2009 under the second 
lien term loan bear interest at a per annum rate of three-month LIBOR plus 
a margin of 5.25% to 6.25% depending on our leverage ratio at the time, or 
6.7% at March 31, 2009, in each case payable quarterly. Pursuant to the terms 
of our credit facilities, we will be required to repay a portion of the 
outstanding principal amount under our first lien term loan based on our 
leverage ratio for the 12 months immediately preceding the receipt of the net 
proceeds from this offering. We expect this repayment to be approximately 
$50.3 million based on our expected leverage ratio and the amount of the net 
proceeds from this offering. We currently do not intend to prepay with the 
proceeds from this offering any additional outstanding indebtedness under our 
December 2005 credit facilities. We intend to use our remaining net proceeds 
from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. We may 
also use a portion of our net proceeds from this offering to acquire or 
license products, technologies or businesses, but we currently have no 
agreements or commitments relating to material acquisitions or licenses. 
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application 
of these proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our 
management regarding their application. 

Pending their use, we plan to invest our net proceeds from this offering in 
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government."

offering price of $20.00 per share. Concurrently with the completion of this 
offering, we will complete a private placement in which we will sell 75,000 
shares of our common stock to Invesco, through our Manager, at $20.00 per 
share and 1,425,000 units of limited partnership interest in our operating
partnership to Invesco, through Invesco Investments (Bermuda) Ltd., at $20.00
per unit. We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from selling 
common stock in this offering will be approximately $165.6 million, after 
deducting the portion of the assumed underwriting discounts and commissions 
payable by us and estimated offering expenses of approximately $4.4 million 
(or, if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, 
approximately $190.7 million, after deducting the portion of the assumed

expenses of approximately $4.8 million). We estimate that the net proceeds we 
will receive in the concurrent private placement of our common stock and OP 
units will be approximately $30 million. 

We plan to use all the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent 
private placement as described above to acquire our target assets in 
accordance with our objectives and strategies described in this prospectus. 
We expect that our focus will be on purchasing Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS, 
CMBS and certain mortgage loans, subject to our investment guidelines and to 
the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification. Our Manager 
will make determinations as to the percentage of our assets that will be 
invested in each of our target assets. Based on prevailing market conditions, 
our current expectation is that our initial investment portfolio will consist
of between 45% to 55% non-Agency RMBS, 10% to 15% CMBS and the balance in
Agency RMBS. However, there is no assurance that upon the completion of this
offering we will not allocate the proceeds from this offering and concurrent 
private placement in a different manner among our target assets. Our decisions
will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in
response to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and 
credit environments. Until appropriate assets can be identified, our Manager 
may invest the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placement in interest-bearing short-term investments, including money market 
accounts, that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. 
These investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek 
to achieve from our target assets. Prior to the time we have fully used the 
net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement to acquire 
our target assets, we may fund our quarterly distributions out of such net 
proceeds."

of which approximately $4.1 million was paid as of March 31, 2009 and
$2.0 million is payable by us in connection with this offering. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the
selling stockholders that may be sold if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares from the selling stockholders is exercised. We expect to use
the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital,
capital expenditures and possible acquisitions. We may also use these net
proceeds to repay all or a portion of our senior secured credit facility in
the aggregate principal amount of $14.6 million (as of March 31, 2009), plus
accrued interest and any fees relating to such prepayment, which bears interest
at a rate equal to the greater of 4.5% or the lender’s most recently announced
prime rate (even if it is not the lender’s lowest rate) plus 2.25% (currently
6.75% per year) and matures in September 2013, in the event that we are unable
to restructure the credit facility or obtain alternative debt financing on more
favorable terms.

The debt under our credit facility was incurred in September 2008, and the
proceeds were used for working capital and to repay outstanding principal plus
accrued interest in an amount equal to approximately $11.0 million under
promissory notes payable to Stonehenge Capital Fund New York, LLC, which bore
interest at a rate equal to 10% per year and had a maturity date of January 
31, 2011.

Although we continually evaluate acquisition opportunities, we have not entered
into any binding commitments or agreements with respect to future acquisitions
and we have no current plans, proposals or other arrangements regarding future
acquisitions.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we will invest the net proceeds of this
offering in interest-bearing, short-term, investment grade, highly liquid
securities."

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, our net proceeds will be approximately $92.4 million. We
intend to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

 • approximately $25 million to improve and upgrade our existing manufacturing
   facilities and production lines;

 • approximately $45 million to build new manufacturing facilities and
   production lines to produce new water treatment products;

 • approximately $10 million to build a research and development laboratory;
   and

 • the balance for general corporate purposes.

We may also use our net proceeds from this offering to fund potential
acquisitions of complementary businesses as such opportunities may arise from
time to time, although we do not presently have specific plans and are not
currently engaged in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any such
transactions. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering
for general corporate purposes, which may include expanding our sales efforts,
opening new offices and developing new products and services. Management has
not determined the specific allocation of our net proceeds from this offering
and will have broad discretion in the allocation of our net proceeds.

Depending on future events and other changes in the business climate, we may
determine at a later time to use our net proceeds for different purposes.
Pending their use, our net proceeds from this offering will be invested in
interest bearing debt instruments or bank deposits. These investments may have
a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your
investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a passive foreign
investment company for U.S. federal tax purposes, which could result in
negative tax consequences for you."

We intend to use approximately US$40.0 million of the net proceeds we receive 
to fund the expansion of our manufacturing capacity. 

We may also use the remaining portion of the net proceeds we receive from this 
offering for other general corporate purposes and for potential acquisitions of,
or investments in, businesses and technologies that we believe will complement 
our current operations and our expansion strategies. We do not have specific 
plans and are not currently engaged in any discussions or negotiations for any 
acquisitions. 

The foregoing estimates of the use of our net proceeds from this offering 
represent our current intentions based upon our present plans and business 
condition. The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending on the 
amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological 
developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our 
management will have significant discretion in the allocation of the net 
proceeds we will receive from this offering. Depending on future events and 
other changes in the business climate, we may determine at a later time to use 
the net proceeds for different purposes. Pending their use, we intend to place 
our net proceeds in short-term bank deposits. 

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we 
are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC

shares of our common stock in this offering by us will be approximately 
$92.0 million (or approximately $106.0 million if the underwriters fully
exercise their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,365,000
shares of our common stock), in each case after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions of approximately $7.0 million (or approximately
$8.1 million if the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option
to purchase additional shares of our common stock) and estimated offering
expenses of approximately $1.1 million payable by us.

We intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in a targeted mix of
Agency RMBS collateralized by hybrid ARMs and fixed rate mortgage loans. 
Specifically, we intend to invest approximately 35% to 65% of the net proceeds
in Agency RMBS collateralized by hybrid ARMs and the remaining net proceeds 
in Agency RMBS collateralized by fixed rate mortgage loans. We then expect to
borrow against the Agency RMBS that we purchase with the net proceeds of this
offering through repurchase agreements and use the proceeds of the borrowings
to acquire additional Agency RMBS in accordance with a similar targeted
allocation. We reserve the right to change our targeted allocation depending
on prevailing market conditions, including, among others, the pricing and
supply of Agency RMBS, the performance of our portfolio and the availability
and terms of financing.

Until attractive investments can be identified, we may temporarily invest a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering in interest-bearing, short 
term, marketable investments, including government securities, certificates
of deposit, money market accounts or interest bearing bank deposits that are
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT and to maintain our
Investment Company Act exemption. These temporary investments are expected to
provide a lower net return than we hope to achieve from our targeted
investments in Agency RMBS."

approximately $183 million (or approximately $211 million if the underwriters 
fully exercise their over allotment option), in each case at the initial 
public offering price of $20.00 per Share and after deducting the underwriting 
discount of approximately $12,500,000 (or approximately $14,375,000 if the 
underwriters fully exercise their over allotment option), and estimated 
offering expenses, of approximately $4.7 million that were not paid with the 
advance from HRPT to us of approximately $6 million and are payable by us. 

We are obligated under our credit facility to use the net proceeds from this 
offering to repay amounts outstanding under such facility until all amounts 
outstanding thereunder at the time of this offering are repaid, except, at our 
election, up to $13.3 million. Promptly following completion of this offering 
and the use of the net proceeds therefrom to repay amounts outstanding under 
our credit facility, we will borrow approximately $9 million under our credit 
facility. We will use approximately $6 million of such amount to satisfy our 
obligation to reimburse HRPT for the funds previously advanced to us by HRPT 
and will retain approximately $3 million of such amount for working capital 
purposes. Accordingly, the use of proceeds from this offering to repay amounts 
outstanding under our credit facility and the subsequent borrowing under such 
credit facility will result in a ""net"" reduction in the amount outstanding 
under our credit facility of approximately $174 million. If the underwriters 
fully exercise their over allotment option at the initial closing, the ""net"" 
reduction in the amount outstanding under our credit facility will be 
approximately $202 million. 

As of June 2, 2009, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under our credit
facility was $250 million, and such loan carries a per annum interest rate, 
currently 5.25%, which rate is calculated at a floating rate based upon LIBOR, 
subject to a floor, or another specified index plus a spread or margin which 
will vary depending upon our leverage. Such loan is required to be repaid, 
together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in full by April 24, 2012. 
Upon completion of this offering, our senior secured credit facility will be 
converted into a $250 million secured revolving credit facility.
