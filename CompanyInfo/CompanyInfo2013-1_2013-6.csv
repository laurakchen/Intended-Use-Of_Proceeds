common stock in this offering will be approximately $62.0 million, based on 
the initial public offering price of $8.00 per share, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses 
payable by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, 
create a public market for our common stock, facilitate our future access 
to the public equity markets and increase our visibility in our markets. We 
intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to develop and 
advance our product candidates through clinical trials, as well as for 
working capital and general corporate purposes. 

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on: the 
type, number, costs, and results of the product candidate development 
programs which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future; 
the scope, progress, expansion, costs, and results of our clinical trials; 
the amounts and timing of any contingent payments from Sanofi; competitive 
and technological developments; and the rate of growth, if any, of our 
business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility 
in applying the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be 
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of 
these net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade securities. The goal with respect to the investment of 
these net proceeds will be capital preservation and liquidity so that 
these funds are readily available to fund our operations; however, we 
cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable 
return."

million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily for the 
acquisition of land, and for development, home construction and other related 
purposes. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering 
in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term, 
interest-bearing investment grade securities, money market accounts, 
certificates of deposit and direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government. 

We will not receive any of the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our 
common stock in this offering by the selling stockholder, including the net 
proceeds received if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional shares."

$45.3 million ($52.3 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full), after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. We expect to use the net proceeds of this
offering to buy farms and farm-related properties, such as coolers, processing
plants, packing buildings and distribution centers, for lease to tenants and, to
a lesser extent, make loans secured by agricultural real estate and to make
payments to our Adviser and our Administrator pursuant to our agreements with
them. As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have commitments to purchase
any properties. We will invest the net proceeds in accordance with our
investment objectives and policies. 

We estimate that it will take approximately 12 months for us to substantially
invest the net proceeds of this offering, depending on the availability of
appropriate opportunities and market conditions. Pending such investment, we
will primarily invest the net proceeds in securities that are not REIT-qualified
investments, as well as REIT-qualified investments such as money market
instruments, short-term repurchase agreements or other cash equivalents. The
non-REIT-qualified investments are expected to provide a current return that
will be greater than the REIT-qualified investments. We may also temporarily
invest in securities that qualify as “real estate assets” under the REIT
provisions of the Code, such as mortgage-backed securities. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to achieve our targeted investment pace.

A tabular presentation of our estimated use of the proceeds to us from this
offering, assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, is
set forth below:

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $27.8 million, based
on the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. If
the representative of the underwriters exercises its over-allotment option in
full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$32.4 million, based on the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share,
and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses
payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for clinical development of
SL-401 and SL-701 and other general corporate purposes:

º SL-401. We plan to complete a pivotal Phase 2b single-arm trial of
  SL-401 in patients with BPDCN. We plan to use approximately
  $1.5 million to complete the BPDCN trial. We also plan to advance
  SL-401 into a registration-directed randomized Phase 2b clinical trial
  to treat adult AML patients as a third-line treatment. We plan to use
  approximately $7 million to initiate and advance the AML trial to an
  interim analysis at 60 and 90 patients.

º SL-701. We plan to advance SL-701 into a Phase 2b clinical trial to
  treat pediatric patients with malignant glioma. We also plan to
  initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial of SL-701 in adult second-line GBM.
  We plan to use approximately $1 million, together with funding we are
  seeking to obtain from the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, for the
  pediatric trial, to complete these trials.

º The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and
results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter
into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

The net proceeds from this offering and our existing financial resources will
not be sufficient to enable us to complete our planned registration-directed
randomized Phase 2b clinical trial of SL-401 in third-line AML in its entirety,
unless the trial is stopped early at an interim analysis at 90 or fewer
patients. We expect to need to raise additional capital in order to complete
this clinical trial, but the timing and extent of the additional capital needed
to do so will depend on the interim analysis timing and results. We believe that
our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the
net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our operations and
our capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

$202.2 million (or $233.3 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering together with available
cash, as necessary, to redeem approximately $191.6 million aggregate principal
amount and accumulated interest of our 13.0% senior notes and to use any
remaining net proceeds for working capital and for general corporate purposes.
Our 13.0% senior notes were issued by Bright Horizons Capital Corp. in the
aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million in connection with our going
private transaction in 2008 and mature on November 28, 2018. These notes bear
interest at a rate of 13.0% per annum, and interest payments on or before
May 28, 2013 may be paid in kind. As of September 30, 2012, there was $81.6
million of interest added to principal under the notes. Under the terms of the
indenture relating to the notes, we may redeem the notes at a price equal to
106.500% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest."

and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

• $5.2 million upon the closing of this offering to pay dividends on the 
outstanding shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock that 
will convert into common stock; 

• approximately $16.9 million to hire additional sales and marketing personnel 
and to support costs associated with increased sales and marketing activities; 

• approximately $12.0 million for capital expenditures, including components 
of the Vantera system and other improvements to our laboratory 
infrastructure; 

• approximately $3.6 million to fund our research and development programs, 
including the expansion of our diagnostic test menu based on the Vantera 
system; and 

• the balance for other general corporate purposes, including general and 
administrative expenses, working capital and the potential repayment of 
indebtedness. 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to 
acquire, invest in or license complementary products, technologies or 
businesses, but we currently have no agreements or commitments with respect 
to any potential acquisition, investment or license. We may allocate funds 
from other sources to fund some or all of these activities.

offering of approximately $414.4 million, after deducting the underwriting
discount and other estimated expenses of approximately $32.7 million. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ordinary shares in
full, the net proceeds to us will be approximately $477.6 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive to (i) prepay an aggregate
total of $55.6 million under our Cash Sweep Credit Facilities that becomes
payable upon an initial public offering consisting of $21.3 million on our
€624.0 million Norwegian Pearl and Norwegian Gem Revolving Credit Facility,
$14.7 million on our €308.1 million Pride of Hawai’i loan, $8.0 million on our
$334.1 million Norwegian Jewel loan, $10.1 million on our €258.0 million Pride
of America loan, and $1.5 million on our €40.0 million Pride of America
commercial loan, (ii) pay Genting HK $79.7 million, together with accrued
interest, that becomes payable pursuant to the Norwegian Sky Agreement upon an
initial public offering and (iii) pay expenses associated with this offering.

We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds that we receive (i) to redeem
up to $122.5 million aggregate principal amount of our $350.0 million Senior
Notes, plus redemption premiums of up to $11.6 million for such senior notes,
(ii) to repay up to $115.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under
our $750.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) for
general corporate purposes to the extent not otherwise applied to debt
repayment. As of September 30, 2012 we did not have an outstanding balance under
our $750.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Subsequently, there
is an outstanding balance under this facility.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use of the
net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business
conditions and other than repayment of our Cash Sweep Credit Facilities, payment
to Genting HK and payment of expenses associated with this offering, as
described above, no specific allocation of the net proceeds has yet been
determined. Our determination of whether to use all or a portion of the net
proceeds to redeem a portion of our $350.0 million Senior Notes will depend on
interest rates and the prices at which our $350.0 million Senior Notes are being
purchased and sold in the market (including relative to the redemption price for
such notes) at or following the consummation of this offering. In addition, the
first optional redemption date under our $450.0 million Senior Secured Notes is
November 15, 2013, and we may call a portion of such notes for redemption at
that time. Our determination of whether to redeem a portion of our $450.0
million Senior Secured Notes will depend on interest rates and the prices at
which our $450.0 million Senior Secured Notes are being purchased and sold in
the market (including relative to the redemption price for such notes) at such
time.

Any net proceeds used to redeem or repay our indebtedness would be first
contributed by the Company to NCL Corporation Ltd. so that NCL Corporation Ltd.
may effect such redemption or repayment. Affiliates of certain of the
underwriters in this offering currently hold or may in the future hold a portion
of the notes that may be redeemed and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the
net proceeds from this offering as a result of the redemption of the notes.
Pending the application of the net proceeds of this offering as described above,
all or a portion of the net proceeds of this offering may be invested by us in
short-term interest-bearing investments.

As of September 30, 2012, there was (i) $350.0 million (which does not include
the unamortized premium of $5.6 million) aggregate principal amount outstanding
of our $350.0 million Senior Notes, which bear interest at a rate of 9.50% per
annum and mature on November 15, 2018 and (ii) $450.0 million (which does not
include the original issue discount of $3.6 million) aggregate principal amount
outstanding of our $450.0 million Senior Secured Notes, which bear interest at a
rate of 11.75% per annum and mature on November 15, 2016. We issued our $250.0
million Senior Notes in November 2010 and our $100.0 million Senior Notes in
February 2012. The net proceeds from the offering of our $350.0 million Senior
Notes were used to repay $147.0 million of certain of our secured term loans,
$198.0 million of our $750.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
and $0.3 million of our capital lease obligations.

As of September 30, 2012, there was $1,104.7 million aggregate principal amount
outstanding under our Cash Sweep Credit Facilities.

A portion of the principal amount of the borrowings under our (i) $334.1 million
Norwegian Jewel loan bear interest at a rate of 6.3575% per annum as of December
31, 2009, and at a rate of 6.8575% per annum thereafter; (ii) €40.0 million
Pride of America commercial loan bear interest at a rate of 6.845% per annum as
of December 31, 2009, and 7.345% per annum thereafter; (iii) €258.0 million
Pride of America loan bear interest at a rate of 5.965% per annum as of December
31, 2009, and 6.465% per annum thereafter; and (iv) €308.1 million Pride of
Hawai’i loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 1.0% as of
December 31, 2009, and LIBOR plus 1.5% thereafter. The interest rate per annum
applied to the remaining portion of the principal amount of our $334.1 million
Norwegian Jewel loan, €40.0 million Pride of America commercial loan, €258.0
million Pride of America loan, and €308.1 million Pride of Hawai’i loan was
LIBOR plus 2.25% as of December 31, 2009; and has been LIBOR plus 2.75%
thereafter. A portion of the borrowings under our €624.0 million Norwegian Pearl
and Norwegian Gem Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to (i) LIBOR plus (ii) an applicable margin, the maximum of which was
1.49% as of December 31, 2009; is 1.99% from January 2010 until October 2013,
and will be 2.20% thereafter. The maximum applicable margin to be applied to the
other portion of the outstanding principal amount adds 6% to the figures for
each of the aforementioned periods (i.e., 7.49%, 7.99% and 8.20%, respectively).
The applicable margin will decrease by 0.1625% if total funded debt to EBITDA
ratio, as calculated pursuant to the loan agreement, is between 4.0 and 5.0, and
will further decrease by an additional 0.125% if total funded debt to EBITDA
ratio, as calculated pursuant to the loan agreement, is less than 4.0.

The principal amount of borrowings under our $750.0 million Senior Secured
Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.00% per annum.

million Pride of America commercial loan and our €258.0 million Pride of America
loan mature on June 6, 2017; our €308.1 million Pride of Hawai’i loan matures on
April 19, 2018; the commitments under Tranche A and Tranche B of our €624.0
million Norwegian Pearl and Norwegian Gem Revolving Credit Facility expire on
November 28, 2018 and October 1, 2019, respectively; and our $750.0 million
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility matures on October 28, 2015.

As of September 30, 2012, there was $209.3 (which does not include a $3.5
million fair value discount) million outstanding pursuant to the Norwegian Sky
Agreement, which amount is to be repaid over seven equal semi-annual payments
beginning June 2013 and has a weighted-average interest rate of 1.52% through
maturity."

partnership will subsequently use the proceeds received from us to fund future
acquisitions of real estate, development of real estate, recurring real estate
expenditures and other non-real estate capital expenditures and general working
capital. Pending application of cash proceeds, we will invest the net proceeds

offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and offering 
expenses. We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $146.4 million 
from our offering of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
concurrently with the closing of this offering. We intend to use approximately 
$23.4 million of the proceeds received to make a distribution to our sponsor 
which will in effect reimburse our sponsor for expenditures made by our 
sponsor during the two-year period prior to this offering for the expansion 
and improvement of Haverhill and Middletown; for federal income tax purposes,
our sponsor is treated as having been the party that made such expenditures 
with respect to Haverhill and Middletown. We also intend to use approximately 
$225.0 million to repay term loan debt bearing a floating rate of interest 
based on LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum and maturing in June 2018 assumed from our 
sponsor and approximately $2.4 million to pay expenses related to our new 
revolving credit facility. As partial consideration for the interest in our 
operating subsidiaries conveyed to us by our sponsor, we will retain $128.7 
million of the net proceeds of this offering and will pay from such retained 
proceeds, 100% (i.e., not merely our 65% proportionate share) of the following 
requirements of our operating subsidiaries: (a) $67.0 million for identified 
environmental capital expenditures, (b) approximately $12.4 million to pay 
sales discounts related to tax credits owed to our customers and (c) $49.3 
million to replenish our working capital. 

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our sponsor’s term 
loan and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the proceeds from this 
offering in the form of repayment of the debt assumed by us. 

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units 
in full, the additional net proceeds to us would be approximately $35.9 
million (and the total net proceeds to us from this offering would be 
approximately $269.1 million). The net proceeds from any exercise of such 
option will be paid as a special distribution to our sponsor. If the 
underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional common units,
we will issue 2,025,000 common units to our sponsor upon the expiration of the 
option for no additional consideration. Accordingly, the exercise of the 
underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of common units

of 24,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions, offering expenses and structuring fees
payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering in the
following manner:

    •   $255.0 million to repurchase the 10.875% senior secured notes due 2017     
        issued by Coffeyville Resources (the “Second Lien Notes”) and pay          
        associated accrued interest;                                               

    •   $160.0 million to prefund certain maintenance and environmental capital    
        expenditures through 2014;                                                 

    •   $55.0 million to fund the turnaround expenses of our Wynnewood refinery in 
        the fourth quarter of 2012; and                                            

    •   $99.0 million for general purposes.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, Coffeyville Resources, on behalf of
CVR Refining Holdings, will, if necessary, contribute to us an amount of cash
such that we will have approximately $340 million of cash on hand at the closing
of this offering, including the proceeds of this offering (other than the $255.0
million used to repurchase the Second Lien Notes). If such amount of cash on
hand at the closing of this offering exceeds $340 million, we will distribute
the excess to Coffeyville Resources.

The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional common units (approximately $85.1 million if exercised in full) will
be used to make a distribution to CVR Refining Holdings. If the underwriters do
not exercise their option to purchase additional common units, we will issue
3,600,000 common units to CVR Refining Holdings at the expiration of the option
period. If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, the number of units purchased by the underwriters
pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the remainder, if
any, will be issued to CVR Refining Holdings. Accordingly, the exercise of the 
underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of units outstanding."

We will use the net proceeds from this offering (excluding the net proceeds 
from any exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional common 
units) to repay $180.7 million of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving 
credit facility. We will incur indebtedness under our revolving credit facility
to fund capital expenditures and for working capital needs. We have incurred 
indebtedness from time to time under our revolving credit facility to fund 
capital expenditures and for working capital purposes. On December 15, 2011 we 
used borrowings under the facility to purchase the compression units previously
leased from Caterpillar for $43 million. On June 1, 2012, we amended our 
revolving credit facility to increase the overall commitments under the 
facility from $500 million to $600 million and entered into our amended and 
restated credit facility, which will become effective only upon the closing of 
this offering, to, among other things, permit the offering-related 
transactions. At September 30, 2012, the interest rate on amounts borrowed 
under the revolving credit facility was 3.0%. Affiliates of each of the 
underwriters participating in this offering are lenders under our revolving 
credit facility and will receive a substantial portion of the proceeds from 
this offering pursuant to the repayment of a portion of the borrowings 
thereunder.

common stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $74.7
million, based on the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, and
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares from us is exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive additional
net proceeds of $14.1 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets. We plan to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts,
certificates of deposit, commercial paper or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government. We currently intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this
offering primarily for working capital and also for general corporate purposes.
We may also use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering
for acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. We
have not entered into any agreements or commitments with respect to any specific
acquisitions and have no understandings or agreements with respect to any such
acquisition or investment at this time. We cannot specify with certainty the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received by us from this offering.
Accordingly, our management team will have broad discretion in using the net
proceeds to be received by us from this offering."

approximately $40.7 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment 
option in full). Our Manager will pay all of our offering expenses and the 
other costs of the offering, including underwriting discounts and commissions. 
We will not reimburse our Manager for its payment of these offering expenses 
and costs. 

We intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering of our common stock in 
(i) pass-through Agency RMBS backed by hybrid ARMs, ARMs and fixed-rate 
mortgage loans and (ii) structured Agency RMBS. Specifically, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

• Approximately 50% to 70% in pass-through Agency RMBS. Of the 50% to 70% of 
  the net proceeds allocated to pass-through Agency RMBS, the net proceeds will 
  be further allocated as follows: 

• approximately 0% to 50% in pass-through Agency RMBS backed by fixed-rate 
  mortgage loans; 

• approximately 0% to 50% in pass-through Agency RMBS backed by ARMs; and 

• approximately 0% to 50% in pass-through Agency RMBS backed by hybrid ARMs. 

• The remaining 30% to 50% of the proceeds will be allocated to structured 
  Agency RMBS. 

We expect to fully invest the net proceeds of this offering in Agency RMBS 
within approximately three months of closing the offering and, for our 
pass-through Agency RMBS portfolio and a certain portion of our structured 
Agency RMBS portfolio, to implement our leveraging strategy within 
approximately three additional months. We then expect to borrow against the 
pass-through Agency RMBS and a portion of our structured Agency RMBS that we 
purchase with the proceeds of this offering through repurchase agreements and 
use the net proceeds of the borrowings to acquire additional pass-through 
Agency RMBS and structured Agency RMBS in accordance with a similar targeted 
allocation. We reserve the right to change our targeted allocation depending 
on prevailing market conditions, including, among others, the pricing and 
supply of Agency RMBS and structured Agency RMBS, the performance of our 
portfolio and the availability and terms of financing. 

Until these assets can be identified and obtained, we may temporarily invest 
the balance of the proceeds of this offering in interest-bearing short-term 
investment grade securities or money market accounts consistent with our 
intention to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, or we may hold 
cash. These investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we 
hope to achieve from our intended investments."

funds necessary to expand our advance commission structure. Any remaining net
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including potential
acquisitions that are complementary to our business or that enable us to enter

allocated 50% to 60% to whole loans, 30% to 40% to non-agency RMBS, 5% to 10% to
MSRs, other real-estate related and financial assets and cash, and 0% to 5% to
agency RMBS. Until appropriate investments can be identified, our Advisor may
invest the net proceeds from this offering in our target asset classes in
different allocations than indicated above, and/or interest-bearing, short-term
investments, including money market accounts and/or funds, that are consistent
with our intention to qualify as a REIT and maintain our exemption from
registration under the 1940 Act, or may elect to pay-down outstanding repurchase
agreements. These initial investments, if any, are expected to provide a lower
net return than we will seek to achieve from investments in non-Agency RMBS,
Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans and our other target assets. In
addition, we will use the net proceeds from this offering to redeem 133 shares
of our 12.5% Series A Cumulative Non-Voting Preferred Stock outstanding for an
aggregate redemption price of $146,300.

Prior to the time we have fully used the proceeds of this offering to acquire 
non-Agency RMBS, Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans and our other target 
assets, we may fund our quarterly distributions out of such proceeds."

offering will be approximately $82.4 million (or $90.5 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses of 
approximately $7.6 million (or approximately $8.2 million if the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option in full). We will not receive any of the 
proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholder,
although we will bear the costs, other than underwriting discounts and 
commissions, associated with the sale of these shares. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to invest in further 
improving the efficiency and capacity of our machines and expanding the number 
of materials from which we can make products, to increase the number and 
locations of our PSCs and for working capital and other general corporate 
purposes. We will also use approximately $9.8 million of the net proceeds 
to repay a revolving line of credit that we have with RFP (the “Rockwell Line 
of Credit”) for working capital. S. Kent Rockwell, our Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer, is the beneficiary of the S. Kent Rockwell Revocable Trust, 
which is the indirect, sole stockholder of RFP. While no limit is specified, 
borrowings are subject to RFP’s approval. Borrowings under the Rockwell Line 
of Credit bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum and are repayable, in 
whole or part, upon demand of RFP. As of January 23, 2013, we had aggregate 
borrowings and interest of approximately $9.8 million outstanding under the 
Rockwell Line of Credit. Additionally, we intend to use up to approximately 
$3.0 million to acquire the assets and assume certain liabilities of TMF and 
Lone Star, our variable interest entities. 

In the event that any net proceeds are not immediately applied, we may 
temporarily hold them as cash, deposit them in banks or invest them in cash 
equivalents or securities."

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,
we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately 
$262.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We expect to use $25.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to repay 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the remainder for general 
corporate purposes, but we have not allocated the remainder of the proceeds for 
any specific purpose at this time. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

As of December 31, 2012, the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit
facility was $25.0 million, with an interest rate of 1.96% per annum. Our
revolving credit facility matures on July 13, 2016. Affiliates of Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, three of the underwriters in this offering, are lenders under
our revolving credit facility and therefore will receive a portion of the net
proceeds of this offering.

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds
in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
investment-grade and interest-bearing instruments."

Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Goldman, Sachs & Co., or certain of 
their affiliates, are holders of our 9.25% Senior Notes due 2015 and as a 
result will receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering.

We intend to use the remaining net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to 
repay $119.0 million of the Tranche B Non-Extended Term Loans. As of December 
30, 2012, there was $243.3 million of the Tranche B Non-Extended Term Loans 
outstanding. The Tranche B Non-Extended Term Loans mature on April 2, 2014. 
Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P., or certain of its affiliates, are lenders 
under our Tranche B Non-Extended Term Loans due 2014 and, as a result, will 
receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering.

Borrowings under the Tranche B Non-Extended Term Loans had a weighted average 
interest rate of 2.74% for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2012. Borrowings 
under the Tranche B Non-Extended Term Loans bear interest, at our option, at a 
rate equal to a margin over either (a) a base rate determined by reference to 
the highest of (1) the administrative agent’s prime lending rate, (2) the 
federal funds effective rate plus ½ of 1% and (3) the LIBOR rate that would be
payable on such day for a LIBOR rate loan with a one-month interest period plus
1% or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the BBA LIBOR rate for the 
interest period relevant to such borrowing. The margin for the Tranche B 
Non-Extended Term Loans is based on a total leverage based grid and is 
currently 1.50%, in the case of base rate loans, and 2.50%, in the case of 
LIBOR rate loans.

We will pay the fees and expenses related to this offering (other than 
underwriting discounts and commissions) and the use of proceeds therefrom 
(including the payment of accrued and unpaid interest) with cash generated from
operations. 

In connection with this offering, we intend to terminate the Advisory Agreement
in accordance with its terms. Upon completion of this offering, pursuant to and
in connection with the terms of the Advisory Agreement, we will pay a

Partners L.L.C., an affiliate of Blackstone and of Blackstone Advisory Partners
L.P., with available cash on hand."

Our Manager will pay directly to the underwriters the underwriting discount of

option to purchase additional shares, approximately $2.8 million). No 
underwriting discount will be paid on the 1,666,667 shares purchased by XL

concurrent private placement in interest-bearing short-term investments,

investments in Agency and Non-Agency RMBS. Although we anticipate that we will 
be able to identify a sufficient amount of investments in Agency and Non-Agency 
RMBS within approximately one to three months after the closing of this 
offering, depending on the availability of appropriate investment opportunities 
and subject to market prevailing conditions, there can be no assurance that we

    $89,811, or $101,460 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, on 
    the sale of the sponsors’ shares. These commissions will be deferred until 
    the closing of our initial business combination. At our option, we may pay 
    these commissions in cash or in shares of our Class A Common Stock (an 
    aggregate of 8,553 shares, or 9,663 shares if the over-allotment is 
    exercised in full, based on a price of $10.50 per share). We have granted 
    EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. registration rights with respect to such shares.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant 
    at $1,113,750 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest 
    income earned on the amounts held in the trust account (net of taxes payable 
    on such interest income) will be available to us to pay our working capital 
    requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be 
    approximately $320,000 over a 24-month period assuming an interest rate of 
    approximately 0.10% per year. 

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business 
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of 
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated 
    expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates 
    for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess 
    working capital. 

(5) We have engaged EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners, 
    L.P. to serve as our financial advisers in connection with our initial 
    business combination. If we consummate an initial business combination, we 
    will pay to such firms an aggregate cash advisory fee equal to 4% of the 
    gross proceeds of this offering.
 
Our sponsors have committed that they will purchase the sponsors’ shares (for an
aggregate purchase price of $14,148,750) from us on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Our sponsors also have
agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters, they
will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per share (up to a maximum of 183,525
shares of Class A Common Stock) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
that is necessary to maintain in the trust account an amount equal to $10.50 per
share sold to the public in this offering. These shares will be purchased in a
private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of shares
resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. All of the proceeds we
receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.

$160,650,000, or $184,747,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the sponsors’ shares will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at UBS Financial Services Inc.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. The funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United
States government treasury bills having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that will be released to us to pay our tax obligations and for our
working capital requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination
or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not
completed a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held
in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete our initial business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Berkshire Capital, an affiliate of Messrs. Cameron, Foote and
Forth, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services
including office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is
being agreed to by Berkshire Capital for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Messrs. Cameron Foote and Forth with compensation in lieu of a salary.
We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in Denver, Colorado and
other Berkshire Capital office locations, that the fee charged by Berkshire
Capital is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated
person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders.
Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s and consulting fees or other similar compensation) will be paid to our
sponsors, Advisory Board members, members of our management team or any of our
or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). Such individuals will, however, receive 
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, 
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business 
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices or other locations of 
prospective target businesses to examine their operations. We cannot estimate 
the amount of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that will be reimbursed to our 
sponsors, officers, directors, Advisory Board members or their affiliates 
because such amount will depend on a number of factors including the number of 
potential target businesses we identify and diligence, the breadth of due 
diligence we conduct on target businesses, the extent of travel and other 
expenses incurred in the diligence process and the length of time it takes to 
consummate an initial business combination with any potential target business. 
Solely by way of example, Highbury reimbursed its officers, directors and 
initial stockholders approximately $85,000 for expenses incurred in connection 
with the consummation of its initial business combination. However, the amount 
of expenses reimbursed by Highbury is not necessarily indicative of the expenses 
our sponsors, officers, directors, Advisory Board members and their affiliates 
will incur in connection with our initial business combination because the 
number of potential targets identified and diligenced, the breadth of due 
diligence, the extent of travel and other expenses and the time required to 
consummate our initial business combination may be different for us than it was 
for Highbury. Since the role of present management after our initial business 
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if 
any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us outside of the trust account to fund
our working capital requirements in searching for our initial business
combination will be approximately $1,113,750. In addition, all of the interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable) will be
released to us. The interest earned on the funds held in the trust account will
be used to pay our tax obligations and fund our working capital requirements in
searching for our initial business combination. We intend to use the after-tax
interest income for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to
assist us with our search for a target business and for director and officer
liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the
event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsors, Advisory
Board members, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available to use from the trust account is insufficient as a result of
the current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team or our
sponsors, but such members of our management team or our sponsors are not under
any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to
EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. equal to 4% of the
gross proceeds of this offering for acting as our investment bankers. To the
extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to
effect our initial business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account
which are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such
working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or
expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for
marketing, research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our officers, directors and certain of our 
sponsors have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation 
(currently anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and have agreed not to seek 
repayment of such expenses. 

As of the date of this prospectus, certain of our sponsors have loaned to us an
aggregate of $200,000 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA
filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion
of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans are payable without interest
on the earlier of (i) November 29, 2013, (ii) the date on which we consummate
our initial public offering or (iii) the date on which we determine to not
proceed with our initial public offering. The loans will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes interest earned on funds held in the trust
account released to us) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our sponsors, officers and directors may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds or invest in us, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at our
discretion, the notes may be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock at a
price of $10.00 per share. If we do not complete our initial business
combination, the loans will be forgiven.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only (1) upon our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have
not completed an initial business combination within the required time period or
(2) if that public stockholder elects to convert shares of Class A Common Stock
in connection with a stockholder vote. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

We intend to contribute the net proceeds to us from this offering to our
operating partnership in exchange for OP Units of our operating partnership. Our
operating partnership intends to use those net proceeds, together with proceeds
of $75.0 million under our New Term Loan, to repay certain indebtedness, to pay

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $67.4 million,
at the initial public offering price of $7.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

cash resources, as follows:

• approximately $50.0 million to fund our planned pivotal Phase 3 program for 
  eravacycline for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and 
  complicated urinary tract infections; and 

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
 
This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the status of and results from clinical trials of eravacycline and
whether regulatory authorities require us to perform additional clinical trials
of eravacycline in order to obtain marketing approvals. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net
proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of net proceeds.

We believe that our available funds following this offering will be sufficient
to enable us to obtain top-line data from both of our planned Phase 3 clinical
trials of eravacycline. We expect that these funds will not be sufficient to
enable us to seek marketing approval for eravacycline or commercially launch
eravacycline. It is also possible that we will not achieve the progress that we
expect with respect to eravacycline because the actual costs and timing of
clinical development activities are difficult to predict and are subject to
substantial risks and delays. We have no external sources of funds other than
our subcontracts with, and subaward from, CUBRC under awards from BARDA and
NIAID. We expect that we will need to obtain additional funding in order to
commercialize eravacycline.

To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock,
convertible securities or other equity securities, the ownership interests of
our existing stockholders may be materially diluted and the terms of these
securities could include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely
affect the rights of our existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available,
would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements
that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific
actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or
declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our
business. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms,
we could be forced to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the
development or commercialization of eravacycline or other product candidates,
seek collaborators at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on
terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available, and relinquish
or license, potentially on unfavorable terms, our rights to eravacycline or
other product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or
commercialize ourselves.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government

circumstances where a reallocation of funds is necessary. The amount and timing
of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including fluctuations in
corporate hiring, economic conditions and availability of opportunities.
Accordingly, we may change the allocation of use of these proceeds as a result
of contingencies.

We intend to use approximately 15% of the net proceeds of this offering for
sales and marketing (which includes approximately 5% for additional payroll for
additional employees in our direct sales team), 25% of the net proceeds for
product development, 40% of the net proceeds for strategic acquisitions and
reserve the remaining 20% of the net proceeds for future growth opportunities

strategic acquisitions and for general working capital. Although from time to
time, we may meet with and identify acquisition targets, we currently have no
agreements or commitments with respect to material acquisitions or investments
in other companies. Management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of

approximately $151.6 million, or approximately $175.0 million if the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, based
on the initial public offering price of $12.50 per share, and, after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions, and estimated expenses of this
offering. We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to our operating
partnership, which will subsequently use the net proceeds as follows:

• $110.0 million of net proceeds of this offering to complete eight       
  financing transactions within 45 days of the completion of this         
  offering. We may fund $7.0 million of these financings through a        
  securitization which would reduce the net proceeds we would use for     
  these financings. The financings consist of six newly originated        
  transactions and two other transactions that we originally financed     
  through issuances of secured notes. We plan to retire these notes in    
  order to allow us to retain a larger portion of project economics. The  
  notes we will retire relate to a sustainable infrastructure project that
  includes the funding for construction of fuel facilities at a U.S.      
  Marine Corp base to reduce energy consumption at the base. The financing
  of this transaction was broken into two separate note issuances and     
  phases of construction. The notes relating to phase one were issued in  
  July 2012, bear interest at 4.24% and mature in January 2018. The notes 
  relating to phase two were issued in March 2013, bear interest at 3.45% 
  and mature in August 2017. An affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
  & Smith Incorporated, one of the underwriters in this offering,         
  currently holds these notes and will therefore receive proceeds from    
  this offering being used for the refinancing.                           

• $4.2 million to repay our existing credit facility and related interest 
  rate cap and swap with Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate of one of the
  underwriters in this offering. The existing credit facility bears       
  interest at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 2.75%. We have
  fixed the interest rate at 4.90% through the purchase of an amortizing  
  interest rate swap from Bank of America, N.A. Both the credit facility  
  and the swap have a maturity date of September 30, 2015.                

The net proceeds remaining after the uses described above, which, assuming we
fund $7.0 million of financings through a securitization, are estimated to be
$44.4 million, or approximately $67.8 million if the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional shares is exercised in full, will be used to acquire
additional assets and for general corporate and working capital purposes.

Pending application of cash proceeds, we will invest such portion of the net
proceeds in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing
securities which are consistent with our intention to qualify for taxation as a
REIT."

13,407,632 shares of Class A common stock in this offering will be approximately
$158.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

    We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering for new
store growth and other general corporate purposes, after (i) paying accrued but
unpaid dividends on our Series A preferred stock totaling approximately
$19.1 million (averaging $444.55 per share of Series A preferred stock),
(ii) paying accrued but unpaid dividends on our Series B preferred stock
totaling approximately $57.7 million ($900.96 per share of Series B preferred
stock), (iii) paying $9.2 million to an affiliate of Sterling Investment
Partners in connection with the termination of our management agreement with
such affiliate and (iv) paying contractual initial public offering bonuses to
certain members of our management totaling approximately $8.1 million.

    Pursuant to an agreement between us and the preferred stockholders, the
number of shares of Class B common stock that we issue in exchange for our
preferred stock (including accrued dividends thereon that are not being paid in
cash with a portion of the proceeds of this offering) was determined based on an
assumed initial public offering price of $11.00 per share and assumed that
$65.0 million of accrued dividends would be paid in cash with the proceeds of
this offering, and the number of shares of Class B common stock to be issued in
the Exchange would not change if we decreased or increased the amount of accrued
dividends we pay in cash with the net proceeds of this offering. Because the
price per share to the public is greater than $11.00 per share and the amount of
dividends paid in cash with the proceeds of this offering increased, we will
recognize a dividend of approximately $42.8 million, representing the additional
cash proceeds used to pay dividends of approximately $11.8 million plus an
amount equal to the number of shares of Class B common stock we issued
multiplied by the difference between the price per share to the public and the
$11.00 price we used to calculate the number of shares of Class B common stock
to be issued by us in the Exchange. The amount of this dividend will be
subtracted from net income to arrive at income available to common stockholders
in the calculation of net income (loss) per share.

    The accrued dividends of $9,652,348 on the Series A preferred stock that are
not paid in cash and the liquidation preference of the Series A preferred stock
of $55,975,400 will be satisfied through the issuance of 6,233,871 shares of
Class B common stock in connection with this offering (of which 33,576 shares
will automatically convert into 33,576 shares of Class A common stock at the
closing of this offering). We received $43,058,000 in the aggregate, or $1,000
per share, upon the issuance of the Series A preferred stock. The accrued
dividends of $29,084,352 on the Series B preferred stock that are not paid in
cash and the liquidation preference of the Series B preferred stock of
$64,016,980 will be satisfied through the issuance of 9,270,425 shares of
Class B common stock in connection with this offering. We received $51,278,000
in the aggregate, or $1,000 per share, upon the issuance of the Series B
preferred stock. In addition, we issued Series B preferred stock having a value
of $12,738,980 to the sellers in connection with our acquisition of the four
then existing Fairway stores in January 2007.

    We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by the
selling stockholders."

selling stockholders of shares in this offering.

We intend to use the net cash proceeds from this offering to redeem 
approximately $91.0 million principal amount of the outstanding notes pursuant 
to the “equity claw” redemption feature of the notes, and to pay the redemption 
premiums and accrued interest thereon, and pay a portion of the approximately 
$16.4 million fee required to terminate the consulting agreements with Apollo

The notes, which are co-issued by EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC Finance Corp., were 
issued on September 30, 2010 in the aggregate principal amount of $220.0 
million and on May 7, 2012 in the aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million. 
The proceeds of the additional notes issued on May 7, 2012 were used to fund a 
portion of the $269.8 million special dividend paid on May 9, 2012 that is

the indenture dated as of September 30, 2012 and mature on October 1, 2018. The 
notes bear interest at a rate of 11.0% per annum. As of December 31, 2012, the 
principal outstanding balance of the notes was $250.5 million. Under the terms 
of the indenture relating to the notes, we may use the cash proceeds from this 
offering to redeem up to $91.0 million principal amount of the notes at a 
redemption price equal to 111.0% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued 
and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption of the notes will be 
in accordance with the terms of the indenture. On March 29, 2013, EVERTEC, LLC 
and EVERTEC Finance Corp. issued a redemption notice (which specified that the 
redemption date for the notes will be on April 29, 2013 so long as this 
offering is completed) and that the redemption of the notes using the net cash 
proceeds from this offering will occur following this offering.

Popular, which is a selling stockholder in this offering and an affiliate of 
one of the underwriters, holds approximately $35.0 million principal amount of 
the notes, which will be repaid with the proceeds of this offering as described 
above.

If we complete the debt refinancing as described in “Description of Certain 
Indebtedness—Refinancing of Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Notes,” we 
intend to redeem the remaining principal amounts outstanding under the notes 
and repay the existing senior secured facilities with a portion of the proceeds 
from such refinancing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter 
into the new senior secured credit facilities and consummate the debt 
refinancing on the terms described in this prospectus or at all."

   •   approximately $45.0 million to fund our Phase 3 development of CMX001,     
       including internal salaries and external costs related to completion of our
       Phase 3 clinical trial, SUPPRESS, and costs associated with initial NDA    
       preparatory work; and                                                      


   •   the remainder to fund other working capital purposes, including general    
       operating expenses and regular debt service payments under our loan and    
       security agreement with SVB and MidCap.                                    


We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire,
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets. However
we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the ongoing status and results of SUPPRESS. Furthermore, we
anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding for the further
development of CMX001 for other indications, and for the development of any of
our other product candidates.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs,
the amount and timing of additional revenues, if any, received from our
collaboration and licensing agreement with Merck, whether we are able to enter
into future licensing arrangements, and whether we are able to extend our
agreement with BARDA. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in
the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our
judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. In
addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or
preclinical activities (including SUPPRESS) if the net proceeds from this
offering and the other sources of cash are less than expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of 
the U.S. government."

of 7,450,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and structuring fees and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. We will use approximately $121.9 million of the
net proceeds from this offering to: 

. repay approximately $34.8 million of borrowings under the $160 million senior
  secured loan facility; 

. repay approximately $9.6 million of borrowings under the $19 million junior 
  secured loan facility; 

. repay approximately $52.1 million of borrowings under the $120 million senior
  secured loan facility, or the Bodil Facility; 

. repay all of our borrowings outstanding (approximately $22.4 million) under 
  the $27.3 million junior secured loan facility, or the Windsor Conversion 
  Facility; and

. to pre-fund approximately $3.0 million of our one-time entrance tax into the 
  Norwegian tonnage tax regime. 

We will use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $16.5 million for general partnership purposes. The $160 million
senior secured loan facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of
3.0% and matures in two tranches in March 2016 and August 2016. At December 31,
2012, the three-month LIBOR plus applicable spread on the $160 million senior
secured loan facility was 3.312%. The $19 million junior secured loan facility
bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 4.5% and matures in two
tranches in March 2016 and August 2016. At December 31, 2012, the three-month
LIBOR plus applicable spread on the junior secured loan facility was 4.812%. The
Bodil Facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.6%
to 3.0% and matures in February 2016. At December 31, 2012, the three-month
LIBOR plus applicable spread on the Bodil Facility was 2.394%. The Windsor
Conversion Facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 3.75% and
matures in May 2015. At December 31, 2012, the three-month LIBOR plus applicable
spread on the Windsor Conversion Facility was 4.061%.

We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,117,500
additional common units. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, we will use the net proceeds (approximately $21.9
million, if exercised in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions) to make a cash distribution to KNOT. If the underwriters do not
exercise their option to purchase any additional common units, we will issue
1,117,500 common units to KNOT at the expiration of the option period. If and to
the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common
units, the number of units purchased by the underwriters pursuant to such
exercise will be issued to the public and the remainder, if any, will be issued
to KNOT. Accordingly, the exercise of the underwriters’ option will not affect
the total number of units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the
minimum quarterly distribution on all units."

common stock by us in this offering will be approximately $590.9 million after
deducting $37.7 million of underwriting discounts and commissions. If the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $679.5 million.

TMHC will use $204.3 million of the net proceeds of this offering to acquire New
TMM Units from New TMM (at a price equal to the price paid by the underwriters
for shares of our Class A common stock in this offering). New TMM will
contribute such net proceeds to its subsidiaries. New TMM’s subsidiaries intend
to use such proceeds to redeem $189.6 million aggregate principal amount of our
senior notes (at a purchase price equal to 103.875% of their principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest of $7.3 million through the date of redemption,
assuming a redemption date of April 12, 2013). TMHC intends to use the remaining
approximately $386.6 million of the proceeds from this offering, together with
$7.3 million of cash on hand to purchase New TMM Units (at a price equal to the
price paid by the underwriters for shares of our Class A common stock in this
offering) held by the TPG and Oaktree holding vehicles, JH and certain members
of our management. We expect that the purchase of the New TMM Units from certain
members of our management will be consummated at closing of this offering and
the purchase of New TMM Units from the TPG and Oaktree holding vehicles and JH
will be consummated promptly following this offering, but in no event prior to
April 15, 2013. Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any disclosures set
forth herein relating to our post-offering capital structure, our post-offering
shareholders (and their holdings) or similar matters assume the successful
completion of these purchases from management, the TPG and Oaktree holding
vehicles and JH. To the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised, the additional net proceeds will be used to purchase additional New
TMM Units from the TPG and Oaktree holding vehicles (at a price equal to the
price paid by the underwriters for shares of our Class A common stock in this
offering). We will use cash on hand to pay the estimated $10.0 million of
expenses in connection with this offering.

Following this offering, in accordance with our growth strategy, we intend to 
opportunistically raise up to $500.0 million of debt capital, subject to 
market and other conditions. We intend to use proceeds from such debt financing 
for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Prior to the application of the proceeds described above, TMHC, New TMM and 
TMM and its subsidiaries may hold any net proceeds in cash or invest them in 
short-term securities or investments."

the sale of shares of common stock offered in this offering, or approximately
$4.0 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses. Of the estimated offering expenses, we already paid
approximately $1.4 million and therefore will have approximately $1.4 million of
additional net proceeds from this offering available to us.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds of the offering as follows:

. $2.0 million to fund our initial contribution to our joint venture with Mayo 
  (assuming we negotiate an extension of the Mayo agreement); and 

. the balance to fund ongoing operations and expansion of the business, 
  including but not limited to further research and development, and hiring 
  additional sales and marketing personnel and support increased sales and 
  marketing activities. 

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plan and business conditions. As of the date 
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering. For 
example, if we identify opportunities that we believe are in the best interests
of our stockholders, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
to acquire, invest in or license complementary products, technologies or 
businesses although we have no current commitments, understandings or agreements
to do so. We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds,
and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the 
proceeds of this offering. The actual amounts and timing of our actual 
expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the success of our efforts 
to market MatBA®-CLL, MatBA®-SLL and MatBA®-DLCBL, to obtain regulatory 
approval to sell MatBA®-CLL, MatBA®-SLL and MatBA®-DLCBL outside our clinical 
laboratory, the timing and progress of our discovery, research and development 
activities for the tests in our pipeline, the success of our efforts to increase
sales of our laboratory services, the success of our efforts to expand our 
international sales, our ability to continue to reduce manufacturing costs by 
leveraging operations in low cost countries, changes in regulatory requirements 
for LDTs, and other unforeseen regulatory or compliance costs. The costs and 
timing of test discovery and development activities, particularly conducting 
clinical validation studies and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval, are 
highly uncertain, subject to substantial risks and can often change. Depending 
on the outcome of these activities, our plans and priorities may change and we 
may apply the net proceeds of this offering differently than we currently 
anticipate. For example, if our joint venture with Mayo does not close, we will 
not be required to make an initial $2.0 million capital contribution, or if once
formed the joint venture fails to achieve certain operational milestones, we may 
not be required to make additional capital contributions. 

As of December 31, 2012, an aggregate of $3.0 million in principal remained
outstanding under the DAM credit facility. Effective January 1, 2012, the DAM
debt bears interest at an annual rate of 10.0%, payable in equal monthly
installments. On February 13, 2013, DAM agreed to convert $1.0 million of the
outstanding principal due to DAM to common stock at the initial offering price
per share upon consummation of this offering. The DAM debt is due on August 15,
2013.

As of December 31, 2012, we had an aggregate of $6.0 million outstanding
pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 21, 2011, as amended and restated
as of February 13, 2012 with John Pappajohn, a member of our board of directors
and a stockholder, Dr. Pecora (indirectly through an investment company), a
member of our board of directors, and NNJCA Capital, LLC, a limited liability
company of which Dr. Pecora is a member. The $6.0 million loan bears an annual
interest rate equal to the prime rate plus 6.25% (9.50% at December 31, 2012)
and matures in twelve months, with an option at our election, if there has been
no event of default, to extend the loan term for an additional six months. The
term loan is due on August 15, 2013 (except as with respect to amounts due to 
Mr. Pappajohn, as described below). On February 13, 2013, NNJCA agreed to 
convert $500,000 of the outstanding principal due to it to common stock at the 
initial offering price per share upon consummation of this offering. Mr. 
Pappajohn will convert $2.0 million of the indebtedness due to him, and on 
February 13, 2013 he agreed to convert the remaining $2.0 million due to his 
spouse pursuant to the December 2011 Credit Agreement, to common stock at the 
initial offering price per share upon consummation of this offering. We 
requested the conversion discussed in this and the preceding paragraph to 
assist the Company in meeting Nasdaq’s initial listing standard for 
stockholders’ equity and in response to market feedback regarding retaining 
capital in the Company after this offering (although we subsequently have 
determined that we are not eligible to list on Nasdaq at this time). We used a 
portion of the net proceeds from this financing to pay approximately $1.4 
million in expenses incurred in connection with our initial public offering."

enhancing our capital ratios to permit growth initiatives and future strategic
acquisitions and for general working capital and other corporate purposes. We
have no present agreement or plan concerning any specific acquisition or similar
transaction. Our management will retain broad discretion to allocate the net
proceeds of this offering. The precise amounts and timing of our use of the

a secondary purpose of the offering, to use approximately $25.4 million of the
net proceeds to retire some of our indebtedness. We intend to repay in full all
$12.3 million of our senior secured indebtedness, including $6.3 million in
senior secured indebtedness that we incurred in March 2012 to provide funds to
complete our acquisition of I Bank Holding Company. We also intend to repay all
of our subordinated debentures that are available for prepayment (excluding
junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred

$79.8 million.

As of March 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $85.0 million. We 
currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, 
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $7.0 million to fund the costs of Phase 1 clinical development 
  of EPZ-5676;

. if we exercise our opt-in right to co-develop, co-commercialize and share 
  profits in the United States for EPZ-6438, approximately $8.0 million to fund 
  a portion of our share of U.S. development costs for this product candidate;

. approximately $30.0 million to fund research and development to build our 
  product platform and advance our pipeline of preclinical product candidates; 
  and

. the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the 
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of 
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, 
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from 
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with 
third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a 
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the 
net proceeds from this offering.
 
Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete Phase 1 clinical development of EPZ-5676 
and, if we exercise our opt-in right as to EPZ-6438, to pay a portion of our 
share of the development costs of that program.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government 
securities."

$27.2 million (based on the exchange rate reported by the Bank of Israel on May
30. 2013) aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures. The interest
rate on our convertible debentures is variable, and is indexed to the rate borne
by the Israeli Government Bonds — Series 817, plus a margin of 6.10%. As of
March 31, 2013, the interest rate on our convertible debentures was 8.10%. The

other uses described above. We are unable to quantify the approximate amount of

    repurchase a portion of our 8.25% Senior Secured Notes, including to pay a 
    call premium of approximately $2.5 million. We will also use a portion of

any material acquisition of or investment in any technologies, products or
companies.

full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. 

As of March 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of 
approximately $124.6 million. We currently estimate that we will use the net 
proceeds from this offering, together with our cash, cash equivalents and 
investments, as follows: 

. approximately $135.0 million to fund our ongoing clinical program for 
  Betrixaban; 

. approximately $28.0 million to fund our continued development of PRT4445; 

. approximately $15.0 million to fund a Phase 1/2 study in hematologic cancers 
  for PRT2070; and 

. the balance to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general 
  corporate purposes, which may include the acquisition or licensing of other 
  products, businesses or technologies. 

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash,
cash equivalents and investments represents our intentions based upon our
current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development and commercialization efforts and the status of and
results from clinical studies, as well as any collaborations that we may enter
into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current
understandings, agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or
licenses of any products, businesses or technologies.

cash, cash equivalents and investments described above, we expect that such
funds will be sufficient to enable us to complete our ongoing Phase 3 clinical
study of Betrixaban, our Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies of PRT4445 and a
Phase 1/2 study in hematologic cancers for PRT2070. However, it is possible that
we will not achieve the progress that we expect because the actual costs and
timing of drug development, particularly clinical studies, are difficult to
predict, subject to substantial risks and delays and often vary depending on the
particular indication and development strategy. We do not expect that the net
proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents and
investments will be sufficient to enable us to fund substantial development of
our other product candidates.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private

months. In particular, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering and
the concurrent private placement intended for clinical development of
quizartinib and our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest
thereon, will be sufficient to fund such development through receipt of topline
data from our planned Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with

acquisitions or investments planned, one or more of these may involve companies
or technologies in the areas of intellectual property analysis and
machine-driven translation, which we believe are growth sectors of interest to
us. Our management will have significant discretion in applying the remaining
net proceeds from this offering. Pending specific application of our net
proceeds, we plan to invest our net proceeds in government securities and other
short-term, investment-grade, marketable securities."

$149.9 million at the initial public offering price of $25.00 per share and

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for growth capital,
including the acquisition of land currently under contract or non-binding
letters of intent, and for general corporate purposes.

Prior to application of the proceeds described above, we may hold any net
proceeds in cash or invest them in short-term securities or investments.

"TALLGRASS ENERGY PARTNERS, LP",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tallgrass-energy-partners-lp-903118-72115,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tallgrass-energy-partners-lp-903118-72115,424B4,5/14/2013,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=9293066,"We intend to use the estimated net proceeds of approximately $259.5 million from
this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, the structuring fee and
offering expenses payable by us of approximately $21.0 million, to retire
approximately $259.5 million of the indebtedness assumed from Tallgrass
Development.

At the closing of this offering, we intend to enter into a new $500 million
revolving credit facility, and to borrow approximately $231.1 million, the
proceeds of which will be used to:

• retire the remaining approximately $140.5 million of indebtedness assumed  
  from Tallgrass Development;                                                

• pay approximately $5.2 million in revolving credit facility origination    
  fees; and                                                                  

• pay $85.5 million to Tallgrass Development as reimbursement for a portion  
  of capital expenditures made by Tallgrass Development to purchase the      
  contributed assets, which Tallgrass Development acquired together with the 
  Retained Assets for $1.8 billion.                                          

The indebtedness assumed from Tallgrass Development was used by Tallgrass
Development to acquire certain assets from Kinder Morgan, including the assets
being contributed to us in connection with this offering, in November 2012.
Certain of the underwriters are lenders under the senior secured term loan under
which the assumed debt was initially borrowed and, in that respect, will
indirectly receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. The 
indebtedness assumed from Tallgrass Development constitutes a portion of 
the senior secured term loan, referred to in this prospectus as the
Term Loan, outstanding under Tallgrass Development’s senior secured revolving
credit and term loan facilities. The Term Loan bears interest, at Tallgrass
Development’s option, at either (a) an alternate base rate, which is a rate
equal to the sum of (x) the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the U.S.
federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (iii) 2.25% and (iv) a one-month reserve adjusted
Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%, plus (y) 3.00% or (b) a reserve adjusted Eurodollar
rate, which is a rate equal to the sum of (x) the greater of (i) 1.25% and (ii)
the Eurodollar rate in effect for the applicable interest period, adjusted for
any statutory reserves, plus (y) 4.00%. The Term Loan matures on November 13,
2018 and amortizes in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% beginning on March
31, 2013 through September 30, 2018, with the remaining amount of principal and
interest due on November 13, 2018.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the
remainder of the 1,957,500 additional common units, if any, will be issued to
Tallgrass Development. Any such units issued to Tallgrass Development will be
issued for no additional consideration. If the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional common units in full, the additional net proceeds
would be approximately $39.5 million. The net proceeds from any exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units will be distributed to
Tallgrass Development."

underwriters elect to exercise in full their purchase option, based on the 
initial public offering price of $24.00 per share, and after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us generated by this offering to support 
our organic growth and for other general corporate purposes. We believe that 
these net proceeds can be deployed to support our organic growth without 
significantly diluting our earnings per share. Although we may, from time to 
time in the ordinary course of our business, evaluate potential acquisition 
opportunities that we believe are complementary to our business and provide 
attractive risk-adjusted returns, we do not have any immediate plans, 
arrangements or understandings relating to any material acquisition."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid  
    from the funds we received from Leland Investments described below. These   
    funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.  

(2) We have agreed to pay the underwriters deferred commissions in an amount    
    equal to $0.40 per unit, or approximately $7.2 million in the aggregate, or 
    approximately $8.3 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is    
    exercised in full, from our trust account upon closing of our initial       
    business combination, as described in this prospectus. The deferred         
    commissions will be released to the underwriters only on completion of an   
    initial business combination, as described in this prospectus.              

(3) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    sponsor’s warrants.                                                         

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $1,000,000 
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income earned
    on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on 
    such interest income), up to an additional $1.75 million, subject to 
    proportionate adjustment in the event the size of the offering changes as 
    a result of the underwriters’ exercise of any portion of the over-allotment 
    option or we otherwise decide to make such a change prior to the 
    effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms 
    a part, will be available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. 
    We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately 
    $360,000 assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.1% per year.                                                                        

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these  
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may   
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in   
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not  
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than           
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.    

Our sponsor and officers and directors have committed that they and/or their
designees will purchase the sponsor’s warrants (for an aggregate purchase price
of $5,200,000) from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the
consummation of this offering. Our sponsor and officers and directors have also
agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in
full or in part, they will purchase from us at a price of $1.00 per sponsor’s
warrant (up to a maximum of 540,000 sponsor’s warrants) additional sponsor’s
warrants in an amount that is necessary to maintain in the trust account an
amount equal to $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering. These
additional sponsor’s warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will
occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of
the over-allotment option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account described below.

$180,000,000, or $207,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the sponsor’s warrants,
including the deferred commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay
our income or other tax obligations and (ii) interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital
requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our redemption of 100% of
the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in
the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Venturehouse Group, LLC, an affiliate of Mark D. Ein, of a
monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being
agreed to by Venturehouse Group, LLC for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Mr. Ein with compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the D.C. area, that the fee charged by
Venturehouse Group, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our
initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month fee and the repayment of
the $150,000 loan from another affiliate of Mr. Ein, no compensation of any kind
(including finder’s and consulting fees or other similar compensation) will be
paid to our sponsor, officers, directors or any of our or their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective 
target businesses to examine their operations. Our board of directors will 
review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, 
officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested 
director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit on the 
amount of such expenses reimbursable by us to such individuals; provided, 
however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not 
deposited in the trust account and the interest income of up to $1.75 million 
(subject to adjustment as described herein) earned on the amounts held in the 
trust account, net of income and other tax obligations, such expenses would not 
be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. 
Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, 
will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$1,000,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
(after payment of taxes owed on such interest income), up to an additional $1.75
million, subject to proportionate adjustment in the event the size of the
offering changes as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of any portion of the
over-allotment option or we otherwise decide to make such a change prior to the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a
part, may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in
searching for a business combination. We intend to use the after-tax interest
earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist
us with our search for a target business and for director and officer liability
insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsor, officers and directors in
connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
up to $1.75 million, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these
funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may
reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories. If our
estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a
business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the
amount of interest available to use from the trust account is less than $1.75
million as a result of the current low interest rate environment, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option or the size of this offering is increased, the maximum
amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust account will
proportionately increase (for example, if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full, the size of the offering will increase by 15%, and
the maximum amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust account
will increase to approximately $2.01 million). In addition, if the size of this
offering is decreased, the maximum amount of interest income we may withdraw
from the trust account will proportionately decrease. We will use any
proportionate increase in interest income to cover our working capital expenses.
While we currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be
and while they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the
offering, we believe that any additional interest income released to us would
facilitate our ability to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater
number of potential acquisition targets.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our executive officers have agreed to pay the
funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no
more than $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, Leland Investments Inc., an entity controlled
by Mark D. Ein, has advanced to us an aggregate of $150,000 which was used to
pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items
above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and
audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the
notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The
warrants would be identical to the sponsor’s warrants. If we do not complete a
business combination, the loans will be forgiven.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period or (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares in connection with a business combination which
we consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

be approximately $71,900,000, or $83,060,000 if the underwriters fully exercise
their option to purchase additional units, based upon an initial public offering
price of $10.00 per unit, and after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately $63.0 million for our capital contributions relating to the  
  construction of the initial phase of our planned facility in Sarnia,       
  Ontario with an expected capacity of 30,000 metric tons, which amount may  
  be reduced to $45.5 million based on the outcome of our discussions with   
  Canadian government agencies for approximately CAD $25.0 million in        
  additional low-interest loans; and                                         

• the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which
  will also include expenses and costs associated with being a public company
  as well as certain interest and principal payments as they come due under  
  our government loans and our proposed credit facility with HTGC.           

Completion of the initial phase of our planned facility in Sarnia is expected to
cost approximately $125.0 million, which we plan to fund through capital
contributions of $63.0 million and $27.0 million from us and from Mitsui,
respectively, and an additional CAD $35.0 million in low-interest loans and
governmental grants that have been committed, subject to our meeting certain
milestones, by various governmental authorities in Canada. As discussed above,
we are also in discussions with Canadian government agencies for approximately
CAD $25.0 million in additional low-interest loans, which would reduce our and
Mitsui’s capital contributions to $45.5 million and $19.5 million respectively.

Based on our estimated capital requirements, we expect that the initial phase of
our planned facility in Sarnia, as well as our working capital requirements
through the mechanical completion of that facility, will be fully funded with a
portion of the net proceeds of this offering, together with various governmental
grants and loans that we anticipate receiving as well as loans from other
sources, equity from our partner Mitsui and cash on hand. We may require
additional financing to fund the planned expansion of the Sarnia facility and to
fund the construction of additional facilities.

We intend to enter into a proposed credit facility subsequent to the closing of
this offering with HTGC pursuant to which HTGC is expected to make available to
us term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million. The
proposed $25.0 million credit facility provides for a mandatory initial advance
at closing of the credit facility of $5.0 million, with interest-only payments
for six months. Interest-only payments will continue for 12 months upon the
beginning of capital contributions from our partner Mitsui. The proposed credit
facility is expected to bear a floating rate per annum interest based on the
prime rate plus 6.75% and contains an upfront facility fee of 2.5% and an end of
term (based on commitment) charge of 11.5%. We will be required to draw down
additional term loan advances of at least $15.0 million on or before December
31, 2013 subject to the initial phase of our planned facility in Sarnia being
fully funded in HTGC’s sole discretion. We will be required to repay the
aggregate principal balance of the loan that is outstanding 36 months after the
closing of the credit facility in monthly installments starting 30 months after
the closing of the credit facility or 24 months after the closing of the credit
facility if the interest-only period is extended. The entire term loan principal
balance and all accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable 36 months
after the closing of the credit facility. At our option, we may prepay all or
any part of the outstanding advances subject to a prepayment charge. 

In addition, the amount of what, and timing of when, we actually spend for these
purposes may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors,
including our future revenue and cash generated by operations and the other
factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this prospectus.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in applying the net
proceeds of this offering. We cannot guarantee the specific amount of the net
proceeds that will be used to construct our planned facilities or be used for
other general corporate purposes. Pending specific application of our net
proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high quality, investment
grade, short-term fixed income instruments which include corporate, financial
institution, federal agency or U.S. government obligations."

offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the
structuring fee, but before paying offering expenses. Our estimate assumes no
exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units.

We will use the net proceeds from this offering (excluding the net proceeds

•  contribute $34.6 million to SSS to repay $34.6 million of SSS's existing 
   debt;

• pay $8.9 million of cash-based compensation awards to senior management at 
  SSS, AEC and Direct Fuels; and

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, improve brand awareness, create a public market for our common

to use the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering for working
capital and other general corporate purposes, including the expansion of our
sales organization, overseas expansion, primarily through channel partners, and
further development and expansion of our solutions. We may also use a portion of
the net proceeds that we receive to acquire or invest in complementary
businesses, products, services, technologies or other assets. We have not
entered into any agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisitions or
investments at this time.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds
that we will receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad
discretion in using these proceeds. Furthermore, the amount and timing of our
actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the cash used in
or generated by our operations, the status of our development, the level of our
sales and marketing activities, the pace of our international expansion plans,
and our investments and acquisitions. Pending the use of proceeds from this
offering as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive
in this offering in short-term and intermediate-term interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade investments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. We cannot predict whether the
invested proceeds will yield a favorable return."

offering to our operating partnership, and we expect to cause our operating 
partnership to use these net proceeds to acquire, restore, lease and manage 
single-family homes as rental properties, to provide short-term private 
mortgage financing secured by interests in single-family homes, repay amounts 
outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility and for general 
business purposes. As of April 26, 2013, we had approximately $61.6 million

these funds to finance our acquisition and restoration activities. As of March 
31, 2013, amounts outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit

shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $489.8 million,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
shareholders, including if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares.

We intend to use (i) approximately $306.0 million of the net proceeds to pay all
amounts outstanding under the $300.0 million term loan, or the Holdings Term
Loan, obtained by Quintiles Holdings in February 2012, including related fees
and expenses, (ii) approximately $50.0 million of the net proceeds to repay
indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, (iii) $25.0 million to
pay a one-time fee to terminate our management agreement with Dr. Gillings and
our Sponsors, and (iv) any remaining amounts for general corporate purposes,
including strategic growth opportunities. We expect that our strategic growth
opportunities may include the acquisitions of businesses that would broaden our
service lines or deepen our scientific, therapeutic or technical expertise.

The Holdings Term Loan accrues cash interest at the rate of 7.50% per year and
we are required to pay interest entirely in cash unless certain conditions are
satisfied, in which case we are entitled to pay all or a portion of the interest
for such interest period by increasing the principal amount of the Holdings Term
Loan, such increase being referred to as paid-in-kind interest, or PIK Interest.
PIK Interest on the Holdings Term Loan accrues at the rate of 8.25% per year. No
principal payments are due until maturity on February 26, 2017. Voluntary
prepayments are permitted, in whole or in part, subject to minimum prepayment
requirements and a prepayment premium equal to (1) 2% of the prepaid amount
($6.0 million if the $300.0 million outstanding amount is prepaid in full), if
the prepayment is made on or prior to the third anniversary of the closing date,
and (2) 1% of the prepaid amount, if the prepayment is made after the third
anniversary of the closing date but on or prior to the fourth anniversary of the
closing date. We used the proceeds from the Holdings Term Loan, together with
cash on hand, to (1) pay a dividend to our shareholders totaling approximately
$326.1 million, (2) pay a bonus to certain option holders totaling approximately
$8.9 million and (3) pay related expenses.

The senior secured credit facilities, which include the $175.0 million Term Loan
B-1, or the Term Loan B-1, obtained by Quintiles Transnational on October 22,
2012, and the $1.975 billion Term Loan B-2, or the Term Loan B-2, obtained by
Quintiles Transnational on December 20, 2012, bear a variable rate of interest
of the greater of LIBOR or 1.25% plus 3.25%, and the interest rate was 4.5% at
December 31, 2012. After March 31, 2013, the Term Loan B-2 will bear a variable
rate of interest of the greater of LIBOR or 1.25% plus an applicable margin of
3.00% - 3.25% based on Quintiles Transnational’s total company leverage ratio,
as defined in the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit
facilities, which relates to the consolidated total company debt and
consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the credit agreement) of both Quintiles
Holdings and Quintiles Transnational, and following a qualified IPO, as defined
in the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities, that
results in gross proceeds of at least $500.0 million, the applicable margin for
the Term Loan B-2 will be 2.75% - 3.25% based on Quintiles Transnational’s total
company leverage ratio. The Term Loan B-1 and the Term Loan B-2 require
Quintiles Transnational to make annual amortization payments of $21.75 million
(payable in aggregate quarterly installments of $5.4375 million) with the
balance due at maturity on June 8, 2018. We used the proceeds from the Term Loan
B-1, together with cash on hand, to (1) pay a dividend to our shareholders
totaling approximately $241.7 million, (2) pay a bonus to certain option holders
totaling approximately $2.4 million and (3) pay related fees and expenses. We
used the proceeds from the Term Loan B-2, together with cash on hand, to repay
the remaining outstanding balance on the then-existing $2.0 billion Term Loan B,
or the Term Loan B, obtained by Quintiles Transnational on June 8, 2011.

Under certain interpretations of the SEC, dividends declared in the year
preceding an initial public offering are deemed to be in contemplation of the
offering with the intention of repayment out of the offering proceeds to the
extent that dividends exceeded earnings during such period. Accordingly, we have
provided pro forma earnings per share information for 2012 that gives pro forma
effect to the assumed issuance of a number of shares whose proceeds are deemed
to be necessary to pay previous year’s dividends in excess of 2012 earnings
($390.3 million)."

. approximately $14 million to fund the external development costs to 
  substantial completion of the Phase 2 portion of our accelerated design, 
  randomized Phase 2/3 study of RPC1063 in patients with RMS;

. approximately $14 million to fund the external development costs to 
  substantial completion of the randomized Phase 2 study of RPC1063 in patients 
  with UC;

. approximately $24 million to fund the external development costs for 
  initiation of the Phase 3 portion of our accelerated design, randomized Phase 
  2/3 study of RPC1063 in patients with RMS;

. approximately $11 million to fund the external development costs for the 
  initiation and a majority of our randomized Phase 2 study of RPC4046 in 
  patients with EoE; and 

. the remainder for internal development costs, in-house research activities, 
  working capital and general corporate purposes, including regular debt 
  service payments under our credit and security agreement with MidCap.

In addition to the net proceeds from this offering, we expect to use our 
existing cash and cash equivalents as well as our access to funds through the 
credit and security agreement we entered into with MidCap in April 2013 
(assuming we do not default under such facility or otherwise become ineligible 
to draw-down funds) for the foregoing purposes.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe 
that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash 
equivalents, together with interest thereon, and our access to funds through 
the credit and security agreement we entered into with MidCap in April 2013 
(assuming we do not default under such facility or otherwise become ineligible 
to draw-down funds), will be sufficient to fund our operations into the second 
half of 2014 and, thus, through the expected availability of top-line Phase 2 
results for RPC1063 in RMS as well as in UC. However, the expected net proceeds 
from this offering will not be sufficient to complete advanced clinical 
development of any of our product candidates, such as the Phase 3 portion of 
our accelerated design, randomized Phase 2/3 study of RPC1063 in patients with 
RMS, or, if applicable, to prepare for commercializing any product candidate 
which receives approval. Accordingly, we will continue to require substantial 
additional capital beyond the expected proceeds of this offering to continue 
our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. Because 
successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to 
estimate the actual funds we will require to complete research and development 
and commercialize our products under development.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts 
and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the 
ongoing status of and results from clinical trials and other studies, as well 
as any strategic collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for 
our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. We cannot specify with 
certainty the uses for the net proceeds to be received by us from this offering 
and our management team will have broad discretion in using the net proceeds to 
be received by us from this offering. Pending the use of proceeds from this 
offering as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in short- and 
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the US 
government."

approximately $31.0 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in
this offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create an active public market for our common stock
and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to
use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $11.0 million to $13.0 million to fund the establishment of a 
  second dronabinol manufacturing facility, including the purchase of related 
  equipment; 

• approximately $11.4 million to repay all of the outstanding principal and 
  accrued interest under our revolving credit facility with Bank of America; 

• approximately $2.7 million to support the submission of our planned NDA for 
  Dronabinol Oral Solution; and 

• the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes, 
  including further development of our family of dronabinol product candidates 
  and our sublingual spray product candidates.

As of March 31, 2013, there was an aggregate of $11.4 million of principal
outstanding under our revolving credit facility with Bank of America, which
consists of short-term borrowings we have used for working capital. Amounts
outstanding under our revolving line of credit bear interest at our election at
either (a) LIBOR plus 1.0% (1.20% as of March 31, 2013) or (b) British Bankers
Association LIBOR Daily Floating Rate plus 1.0%. The outstanding amounts under
the facility are currently scheduled to mature on February 15, 2014.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in complementary businesses or products; however, we have no current commitments
or obligations to do so. Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds
from this offering in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government. We believe that the net proceeds from this
offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest
thereon, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12
months.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the commercial success of Subsys and Dronabinol SG Capsule,
whether and when we are able to obtain regulatory approval for and commercially
launch Dronabinol Oral Solution, the timing and progress of our plans to build a
second dronabinol manufacturing facility, the size of our sales force, our
decisions to conduct, and the progress of, our preclinical and clinical trials
and other development and commercialization efforts, as well as the amount of
cash used in our operations. Therefore, the amount actually spent for the
purposes described above may vary significantly. We also may find it necessary
or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds."

    We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as follows:

        • approximately $12.0 million to fund new Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical
          trials of multiple product candidates;

        • approximately $9.0 million to expand our Sativex manufacturing
          capabilities by purchasing new extraction and purification, vial

          have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any such
          acquisitions.

on numerous factors. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion over the uses of
the net proceeds in this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment

concurrent private placement will be approximately $148.8 million (or 
approximately $168.1 million if the underwriters fully exercise their 
over-allotment option), based on the initial public offering and concurrent 
private placement price of $20.00 per share and after deducting the offering 
expenses which have been paid or are payable by us and excluding the 
underwriting discounts and commissions payable by our Manager or its affiliates
on the shares sold in this offering. 

We intend to deploy the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement as follows: 

. approximately 55% to 65% in Agency RMBS backed by 30-year fixed rate 
  mortgages; 

. approximately 15% to 25% in Agency RMBS backed by 15-year fixed rate 
  mortgages; 

. approximately 0% to 10% in Agency RMBS backed by Hybrid/ARM mortgages; and 

. approximately 10% to 20% in non-Agency RMBS backed by Subprime/Alt-A/Prime 
  mortgages and in our other targeted assets 

We expect to deploy at least 80% of the net proceeds of this offering and the
concurrent private placement in Agency RMBS backed by 30-year and 15-year fixed
rate mortgages. Taking into account our targeted leverage ratios and the
targeted allocation of our equity capital described above, we estimate that,
during the six month period following the completion of this offering, our
assets will be allocated 0-10% to non-Agency RMBS and 90-100% to Agency RMBS.

Our asset acquisition decisions will be based on market conditions and other
factors that our Manager deems relevant at the applicable time. Based on our
expectation that the Agency RMBS market will continue to provide attractive
opportunities, we expect that our equity capital will primarily be deployed in
Agency RMBS investments for the foreseeable future. However, we cannot assure
you that we will not change the allocation of our equity capital over time. We
reserve the right to change the way we allocate our capital at any time and from
time to time, depending on prevailing market conditions, including, among other
things, the pricing and supply of Agency RMBS, the performance of our portfolio
and the availability and terms of financing and our assessment of actual or
potential governmental policy changes or interventions. Capital allocated to a
particular class of Agency RMBS may reflect the actual usage of cash, such as in
connection with the payment of the purchase price for such assets or in
connection with the posting of collateral with third parties in connection with
the financing of such assets, or may represent deemed allocations of capital
pursuant to internal liquidity guidelines in connection with the financing or
maintenance of such assets. We expect to borrow against our Agency RMBS and
non-Agency RMBS securities through repurchase agreements and use the proceeds of
the borrowings to acquire additional assets. Over time, we expect to deploy or
redeploy a portion of our capital into targeted assets that may include MSRs and
other mortgage- and real estate-related assets. We may also use the net proceeds
of this offering and the concurrent private placement for general corporate
purposes.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering and
the concurrent private placement in readily marketable, interest-bearing,
short-term investment grade securities or money market accounts that are
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. Such temporary investments
are expected to provide a lower net return than we anticipate achieving from our
targeted investments.

While we intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering
and the concurrent private placement to acquire Agency RMBS as described above,
we will have significant flexibility, subject to our investment guidelines, to
acquire assets other than Agency RMBS with which you may not agree or for
purposes that are different in range or focus than those described above and
elsewhere in this prospectus.

Although we do not intend to use any of the net proceeds from this offering and
the concurrent private placement to fund distributions to our shareholders, to
the extent we use these net proceeds to fund distributions, these payments may
be treated as a return of capital to our shareholders.

Our initial investors have agreed to fund the remaining portion of their capital
commitments to us, which equal approximately $21.0 million of additional capital
in the aggregate, through a private placement of 1,050,000 common shares at the
public offering price of $20.00 per share concurrent with the completion of this
offering."

maturity date of August 1, 2017 and had an outstanding balance of approximately
$100.3 million as of April 2, 2013. As of April 2, 2013, the balance outstanding

over-allotment option, we estimate that the net proceeds from the offering will
be approximately $81,021,000.

As of March 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of €36.1 million. We
currently expect that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, together
with our cash and cash equivalents on hand, as follows:

. approximately € 61 million to fund our current DMD development portfolio for 
  which we bear expenses (PRO045, PRO053, PRO052 and PRO055), PROSPECT and 
  DMD-support projects, including our DMD natural history study; 

. approximately € 8 million to fund non-DMD projects, including DM1 and HD; and 

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs,
the amount and timing of additional revenues, if any, received from our
collaboration with GSK and whether we enter into future collaborations. As a
result, management will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might decide
to postpone or not pursue other clinical trials or preclinical activities if the
net proceeds from this offering and our other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next 24 months. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available
capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations and certificates of
deposit."

underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full), at
the initial public offering price of $6.00 per share and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the development of our
commercial infrastructure and other general corporate and working capital
purposes, including the potential in-licensing and initial development of
additional product candidates. We believe that our current cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, together with amounts available under
our credit facility, are sufficient to fund each of our current product
candidates through development. However, we expect to need to raise additional
funds for the commercialization of these product candidates. Pending use of the
proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities or
certificates of deposit.

We have not determined the amounts we plan to spend in any of the areas listed
above or the timing of these expenditures. As a result, our management will have
broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds to us from this offering, and
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of the proceeds from this offering. We reserve the right to change
the use of these proceeds as a result of certain contingencies such as
competitive developments, the results of our commercialization efforts,
acquisition and investment opportunities and other factors."

additional shares, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions in
connection with this offering we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately
$917 million. We expect to have estimated offering expenses payable by us of
approximately $32 million.

Assuming that the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase
additional shares, we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to
(i) redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire approximately $633 million
of the outstanding January 2013 Senior Subordinated Notes and to pay accrued and
unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date, (ii) redeem, repurchase or
otherwise acquire or retire $185 million of the outstanding October 2012 Senior

and (iii) pay related fees and expenses, including the payment to the Equity
Sponsors of a transaction fee of approximately $10 million and an aggregate fee
to terminate the consulting agreements of approximately $18 million in
connection with the consummation of this offering.

Alternatively, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares such that we receive sufficient net proceeds from the offering to permit 
us to redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire all $950 million of the
outstanding January 2013 Senior Subordinated Notes, we intend to instead use

Subordinated Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to up to 100% of the
January 2013 Senior Subordinated Notes with funds in an equal aggregate amount
not exceeding the aggregate proceeds of any one or more qualified public
offering, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest. The January 2013 Senior Subordinated Notes
mature on January 15, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 10.50% per annum. HDS
issued the January 2013 Senior Subordinated Notes at par on January 16, 2013,

price equal to 103.375% of the principal amount thereof and pay (together with
$36 million of cash on hand) accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the

The terms of the indenture governing the October 2012 Senior Notes provide
that at any time and from time to time prior to October 15, 2015, HDS may at its
option redeem October 2012 Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal
to up to 35% of original aggregate principal amount of the October 2012 Senior
Notes with funds in an equal aggregate amount not exceeding the aggregate
proceeds of any one or more equity offerings, at a redemption price equal to
111.50% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The
October 2012 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of

thereon through the redemption date.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets, 
as well as to obtain additional capital. We intend to use the net proceeds from
this offering for general corporate purposes. In addition, we may use a portion
of the proceeds from this offering for acquisitions of complementary businesses,
technologies or other assets, although we do not currently have any plans for 
any acquisitions. We may allocate funds from other sources to fund some or all
of these activities.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with 
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the 
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly, 
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds 
of this offering.

The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our 
business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and     
    audit fees, have been paid from the funds we received from Charles F. Fistel
    and Anthony Minnuto described below. These funds will be repaid out of the  
    proceeds of this offering available to us.                                  

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    sponsors’ shares.                                                           

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at
    $405,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest or  
    other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment 
    of taxes owed on such interest income) will be available to us to pay for   
    our working capital requirements. We estimate the interest or income earned 
    on the trust account will be approximately $82,764 (or $95,178 if the 
    over-allotment option is exercised) over a 18-month period assuming an 
    interest rate of approximately 0.10% per year.                                          

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial        
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business    
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of         
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated 
    expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates   
    for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess    
    working capital.                                                            

Our sponsors have committed that they and/or their designees will purchase the
sponsors’ shares (for an aggregate purchase price of $5,074,000) from us on a
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.
Anthony Minnuto, one of our sponsors, also has agreed that if the over-allotment
option is exercised by the underwriters, he will purchase from us at a price of
$8.00 per share the number of shares of our common stock (up to a maximum of
79,200 shares of our common stock) that is necessary to maintain in the trust
account an amount equal to $8.36 per share sold to the public in this offering.
These shares will be purchased in a private placement that will occur
simultaneously with the purchase of shares resulting from the exercise of the
over-allotment option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will
be placed in the trust account described below.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the sponsors’ shares, $8.36
per share sold to the public in this offering (regardless of whether or not the
over-allotment option is exercised in full or in part) will be placed in a trust
account in the United States at UBS Financial Services Inc., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
funds held in the trust account will be invested only in United States
government treasury bills having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to (1) interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations
and (2) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us for our working capital requirements, the proceeds will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our
initial business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public
shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time
period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

In addition, we have agreed to pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee of $1,848,000
upon consummation of a business combination for acting as our investment banker
on a non-exclusive basis to assist us in structuring and negotiating a business
combination (but not for purposes of identifying a target business).

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees or other
similar compensation) will be paid to our sponsors, members of our management
team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, facilities or similar locations of prospective target businesses to
examine their operations. Since the role of present management after our initial
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $405,000. In addition, interest or income earned on the funds held
in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest or other
income) may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in
searching for our initial business combination. We intend to use the after-tax
interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to
consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for director
and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve
in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring
and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsors, officers
and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest or income earned on the funds held in the
trust account, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds.
In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some
of such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available to use from the trust account is insufficient as a result of
the current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the fee equal to $1,848,000
payable to EarlyBirdCapital upon consummation of the business combination for
acting as our investment banker on a non-exclusive basis to assist us in
structuring and negotiating a business combination (but not for purposes of
identifying a target business). To the extent that our capital stock is used in
whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination,
the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a
business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our officers have agreed to pay the
out-of-pocket expenses necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, Charles F. Fistel and Anthony Minnuto have
loaned to us an aggregate of $170,000, or such greater amount as may be
necessary, to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee,
the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The loans are payable without interest on the
earlier of (i) the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or
(ii) the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial public
offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that our initial
business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary,
in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering, our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, the notes may be
converted into shares of common stock at a price of $8.00 per share. If we do
not complete our initial business combination, the loans will be forgiven.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (1) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period or (2) if that public
stockholder elects to convert shares of common stock in connection with a 
stockholder vote. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any 
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $63.1 million based upon the
initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment option to purchase additional shares
in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $72.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations and continued development of ETC-1002, to establish a
public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the
public capital markets.

We estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $29.0 million to fund development costs associated with
  clinical studies and related operations of our Phase 2b program of
  ETC-1002 and for costs associated with our end of Phase 2 meeting with
  the FDA;

• approximately $12.0 million to fund development costs associated with
  non-clinical studies and related activities for ETC-1002; and

• the remainder for general corporate purposes, including internal
  development costs, working capital, general administrative costs and
  the prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual property.

We do not currently have commitments for pre-clinical activities related to
ESP41091 or 4WF and we do not currently expect to use any of the net proceeds
from this offering for these purposes; however, to the extent available after
funding the development of ETC-1002 through our end of Phase 2 meeting with the
FDA and not otherwise allocated to initiate our intended Phase 3 clinical
program of ETC-1002 or required for general corporate purposes, we may elect to
undertake IND-enabling studies of 4WF or ESP41091, which we estimate would cost
approximately $9.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively.

We expect to announce top-line results from our latest currently anticipated
Phase 2b clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2014 and to have our end of
Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2015. Based upon our
currently anticipated Phase 2 clinical trials, we believe we will have
sufficient resources to initiate our intended Phase 3 clinical program of
ETC-1002 in a statin intolerant population, although we will need to raise
additional capital to complete it.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of
the particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our research and
development efforts, the progress of our clinical trials, our operating costs
and capital expenditures and the other factors. Accordingly, we will retain the
discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering among the identified 
uses described above, and we reserve the right to change the allocation of the
net proceeds among the uses described above.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high quality,
investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government, or hold them as cash."

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

. approximately $20 million to commercialize Prosigna after obtaining regulatory
  authorization, including establishing a dedicated oncology sales force; 

. approximately $10 million to expand the clinical utility of Prosigna and to 
  develop other potential diagnostic product opportunities;

estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$131.7 million.

As of May 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
$39.7 million. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with our cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

.  approximately $52 million to fund the clinical development of and seek
   marketing approval for ataluren for the treatment of nmDMD;

.  approximately $28 million to fund the clinical development of and seek
   marketing approval for ataluren for the treatment of nmCF;
 
.  approximately $12 million to fund pre-approval commercial efforts for 
   ataluren;

.  approximately $11 million to fund research and development of ataluren for
   additional indications and for our earlier stage programs; and

.  the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products,
businesses or technologies.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to complete the confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial of
ataluren for the treatment of nmDMD and initiate a confirmatory Phase 3 clinical
trial of ataluren for the treatment of nmCF. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect. This estimate assumes, among other
things, that we do not receive conditional approval to market ataluren for nmDMD
or nmCF prior to completing a Phase 3 clinical trial for the applicable
indication and, as a result, that we do not incur significant related
commercialization expenses prior to such time.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government

The net proceeds from this offering will be used by Truett-Hurst, Inc. to 
purchase newly-issued LLC Units from the LLC. In connection with the waiver we 
received from Bank of the West in March 2013, we intend to cause the LLC to use 
25% to 35% of the proceeds to pay down amounts owed on our credit facility.

whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return for us.
 
Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public
market for our Class A common stock, increase our visibility in the marketplace

amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary
gene therapy businesses, technologies, products or assets. Due to the many
variables inherent to the development of gene therapy products at this time,
such as the timing of patient enrollment and evolving regulatory requirements,
we cannot currently predict the stage of development we expect the net proceeds
of this offering to achieve for our clinical studies and product candidates.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the results of our research and development efforts, the
timing and success of preclinical studies, our ongoing clinical studies or

submissions. As a result, our management will have broad discretion over the use

three months ended March 31, 2013 to finance our operations and the PlanSwift
acquisition and becomes payable upon completion of this offering. We currently
intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds to finance our growth, working
capital, and other general corporate purposes, although we have not yet
determined with certainty the manner in which we will allocate the remainder of
the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we believe that opportunities
may exist from time to time to expand our current business through acquisitions
of, or investments in, complementary companies, products or technologies. we 
have no currentagreements, commitments or understandings for any specific 
acquisitions or investments at this time. However, we may use a portion of the 
net proceeds for these purposes in the future.

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the
proceeds in short-term interest-bearing, investment-grade securities,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States
government, or hold as cash."
"LIGHTINTHEBOX HOLDING CO., LTD.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/lightinthebox-holding-co-ltd-904530-72287,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/lightinthebox-holding-co-ltd-904530-72287,424B4,6/6/2013,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=9341338,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of 
approximately $70.1 million, or approximately $71.8 million if the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs from us in full, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the 
selling shareholders.  

We plan to use net proceeds of this offering to finance the operations of our 
business, including the following: 

•  approximately $15 million for investments in fulfillment and technology 
   infrastructure;  

•  approximately $15 million for expansion of product offerings and categories;  

•  approximately $15 million for customer acquisition and brand building; and  

•  approximately $1.1 million for payment of interest accrued for our 
   convertible notes issued in March 2012. 

We will use the remaining portion of the net proceeds we receive from this
offering for general corporate purposes. If the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional ADSs in full, we intend to apply the additional
net proceeds in the same manner and in the same proportions as described above.

The foregoing represents our intentions as of the date of this prospectus
with respect of the use and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering
based upon our present plans and business conditions, but our management will
have significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of the
offering. The occurrence of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may
result in application of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as
described in this prospectus.

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not
immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds
in short-term, interest bearing, debt instruments or bank deposits.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we, as an offshore holding
company, are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our
PRC subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to other entities
only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiary or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to
fund their capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely
basis, if at all."
RCS CAPITAL CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/rcs-capital-corp-900520-71870,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/rcs-capital-corp-900520-71870,424B4,6/6/2013,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=9340050,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common
stock by us in this offering will be approximately $44.6 million, or
approximately $51.6 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, based on the initial public
offering price of $20.00 per share, in each case after deducting the
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to expand our lines of 
business, which consist of our wholesale broker-dealer, our investment banking 
and capital markets business, our transaction management service provider and 
our transfer agency business. Because our wholesale broker-dealer has an 
operating history and our other business lines have a limited or no operating 
history, we expect a substantial portion of the proceeds to be allocated to 
the expansion of our newer lines of business, consisting of our investment 
banking and capital markets business, our transaction management service 
provider and our transfer agency business. However, we intend to use a portion 
of such allocation to fund the continued growth of our wholesale broker-dealer.
We expect approximately 85% of the net proceeds from this offering to be 
allocated to such business expansion, unless we identify complementary 
businesses which we would then intend to acquire. We expect to allocate the 
remaining approximately 15% of the net proceeds from this offering for general 
corporate purposes. While we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this 
offering to acquire complementary businesses, at this time we cannot reasonably
anticipate the percentage of net proceeds that we would allocate to such 
acquisitions. Our board of directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, 
will ensure that the net proceeds are allocated in a manner that, in its 
business judgment, will be in the best interest of all our stockholders. Except
with respect to the dividends, we do not anticipate making, and do not 
anticipate that our operating subsidiaries will make, dividends or 
distributions in the foreseeable future. Although we explore possibilities for 
potential acquisition candidates from time to time, currently we do not have 
any plans to acquire any company or business. 

As discussed above, we expect that approximately 85% of the net proceeds from
this offering will be allocated among our operating subsidiaries to fund their
growth and expansion and approximately 15% will remain with us for working
capital purposes, unless we identify a complementary business to acquire. If we
do identify such a complementary business, we expect that the appropriate
proceeds will be held with us until such time as the prospective acquisition
requires their expenditure."
