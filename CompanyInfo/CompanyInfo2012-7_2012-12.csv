proceeds from all equity offerings, including this offering, to repay 
outstanding indebtedness under the facility. As of July 25, 2012, the 
balance outstanding under our credit facility was $61.5 million. Our credit 
facility matures in July 2016 and bears interest at an amount between LIBOR

not currently discussing any such potential acquisition or investment with any 
third party. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for repayment of our
existing indebtedness. The amount and timing of these expenditures will vary 
depending on a number of factors, including competitive and technological 
developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business.

received by us from this offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our 
senior secured credit facility. 

On May 24, 2011, we entered into our senior secured credit facility, which 
bears interest at a variable rate based on prime, federal funds or LIBOR plus 
an applicable margin based on our total leverage ratio. Our interest rate at 
March 25, 2012 was 8.5%. The senior secured credit facility matures on May 
24, 2016 or sooner upon the occurrence of an event of default. 

We used the following amounts of the net proceeds from our senior secured 
credit facility as follows: 

. approximately $20.8 million to repay all outstanding loans and accrued 
and unpaid interest, servicing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit 
fees under our credit facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, Inc.; 

. approximately $10.1 million to repay the outstanding principal, interest 
and expenses under our credit facility with HBK Investments L.P.; 

. approximately $1.6 million to pay the expenses of the lenders; and 

. approximately $20.0 million to pay a dividend of $19.0 million to our 
common and preferred stockholders and other special cash bonus payments to 
certain members of management. 

On March 21, 2012, we entered into a credit facility amendment to increase 
the available amount under the facility from $67.5 million to $92.5 million. 
In connection with the amendment, we borrowed an additional $25.0 million 
under the term A loan facility of our senior secured credit facility. We 
used the net proceeds from the amendment and the additional borrowings under 
the term A loan facility as follows: 

. approximately $22.4 million to repurchase shares of our common stock, series 
A preferred stock, series B preferred stock, and series X preferred stock on 
April 6, 2012; 

. approximately $2.0 million to pay the termination fee to terminate the 
advisory agreement with our Sponsor; and 

. approximately $0.6 million to pay transaction costs related to the credit 
facility amendment and the stock repurchase. 

Additionally, we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
by $2.3 million to fund new restaurant capital expenditures. On March 28 and 
May 11, 2012, we also borrowed $2.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, 
under our delayed draw term B loan. Our interest rate at May 15, 2012 was 
8.5% under our delayed draw term B loan. We used these borrowings to fund 
new restaurant capital expenditures and to repay $1.5 million outstanding 
under our revolving credit facility. 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including the status of our expansion efforts, sales and marketing 
activities and competition. Accordingly, our management will have broad 
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be 
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the

(1)  Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their 
shares in connection with our successful consummation of our initial business 
combination.  

(2)  In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the 
proceeds of an aggregate of approximately $100,000 in loans and advances from 
our sponsors, as described in this prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon 
consummation of this offering out of the $350,000 of offering proceeds that 
has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than 
underwriting commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than 
set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing 
working capital expenses.  

(3)  Our counsel has agreed to defer legal fees for services provided in 
connection with the offering in the amount of $115,000. Such deferred legal 
fees will be payable by us only upon the successful completion of our initial 
business transaction. In the event we do not consummate our initial business 
transaction the deferred legal fee will not be paid. Accordingly, the deferred 
legal fee is not reflected as a cost of this offering in the above “Estimated 
Offering Expenses”.  

(4)  Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq 
and terminating on the consummation of our initial business combination (or 
our earlier liquidation), we have agreed to pay Infinity-C.S.V.C. Management 
Ltd, an affiliate of our sponsors, an aggregate of $10,000 per month for 
office space, administrative services and secretarial support.  

(4)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business 
combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. 
In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject 
to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with 
legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, 
our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of 
consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not 
anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations 
among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to 
the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of 
expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount of interest 
available to us from the trust account may be less than $100,000 as a result 
of the current or future interest rate environment.  

A total of $40,000,000 ($46,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option 
is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of 
the insider warrants described in this prospectus, will be placed in a trust 
account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and 
will be invested only in any of (i) U.S. treasuries having a maturity of 180
days or less, (ii) any open ended investment company that holds itself out 
as a registered money market fund, which invests in U.S. treasuries, or 
(iii) any open ended investment company that holds itself out as a money 
market fund, which invests in U.S. treasuries selected by the Company 
meeting the conditions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of Rule 2a-7 
promulgated under the Investment Company Act. Except for the interest income 
that may be released to us to pay any taxes and to fund our working capital 
requirements, as discussed below, none of the funds held in trust will be 
released from the trust account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation 
of our initial business combination within 18 (or 21) months and (ii) a 
redemption to public shareholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the 
event we do not consummate our initial business combination within the 
applicable period. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to 
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our 
initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid 
for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from 
the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection 
with our business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust 
account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate 
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired 
businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness 
incurred in consummating the initial business combination, to fund the 
purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income 
that may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be 
sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. 
This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due 
diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest, 
we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances 
of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and 
signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the 
terms of our initial business combination. However, if our estimate of the 
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial 
business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, 
or the amount of interest available to use from the trust account is less 
than $100,000 as a result of the current interest rate environment, we may 
be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost 
of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such 
additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of 
our management team, but such members of our management team are not under 
any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. 

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq and 
terminating on the consummation of our initial business combination (or our 
earlier liquidation), we have agreed to pay Infinity-C.S.V.C. Management Ltd, 
an affiliate of our sponsors, an aggregate of $10,000 per month for office 
space, administrative services and secretarial support. This arrangement is 
being agreed to by Infinity-C.S.V.C. Management Ltd for our benefit and is 
not intended to provide our sponsors compensation in lieu of salary or other 
remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we 
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our 
initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these 
monthly fees. 

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsors have loaned and advanced to 
us a total of approximately $100,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses 
of this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are 
due at the earlier of September 30, 2012 or the closing of this offering. The 
loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $350,000 of 
offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering 
expenses. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsors or an affiliate of our 
sponsors or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering 
proceeds held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. 
Up to $500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post 
business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option 
of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the sponsor warrants. The 
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been 
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

Unlike many blank check companies, we are permitted to pay our sponsors, 
officers, directors or their affiliates up to $400,000 in finder’s fees, 
consulting fees or other compensation for the introduction to us of a target 
business (with which we ultimately consummate our initial business 
combination) or in connection with services such person (or persons) may 
render for us in connection with the consummation of our initial business 
combination. Any such fee or other compensation paid will be disclosed in 
our tender offer documents if we proceed with our initial business 
combination under the tender offer rules or in our proxy solicitation 
documents if we proceed with our business combination pursuant to the 
proxy rules. 

If we are no longer a FPI and seek shareholder approval of our initial 
business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with 
our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, we may enter 
into privately negotiated transactions to purchase public shares from 
shareholders following consummation of the initial business combination 
with proceeds released to us from the trust account immediately following 
consummation of the initial business combination. Our sponsors, directors, 
officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately 
negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of 
our initial business combination. Neither our directors, officers, advisors 
nor their affiliates will make any such purchases when we or they are in 
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the 
seller. Although we do not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase 
price (over the trust value) for such public shares, in the event we do, the 
payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of those shareholders 
not receiving any such premium. In addition, the payment of a premium by us 
after the consummation of our initial business combination may not be in the 
best interest of the remaining shareholders who do not redeem their shares. 
Such shareholders may experience a reduction in book value per share compared 
to the value received by shareholders that have their shares purchased by us 
at a premium. Nevertheless, because any payment of a premium by us will be 
made only from proceeds released to us from the trust account following 
completion of a business combination, no such payments will reduce the per 
share amounts available in the trust account for redemption in connection 
with the business combination. Except for the limitations described above 
on use of trust proceeds released to us prior to consummating our initial 
business combination, there is no limit on the amount of shares that could
be acquired by us or our affiliates, or the price we or they may pay, if we 
hold a shareholder vote. 

Our sponsors have indicated they may purchase: (i) if we are no longer a 
FPI and we hold a shareholder meeting and conduct redemptions pursuant to 
proxy rules, up to $10,000,000 worth of shares in open market transactions
as described herein; provided, however, to the extent our sponsors do not 
purchase $10,000,000 worth of shares in the open market, our sponsors have 
the option to purchase the difference in a private placement of ordinary 
shares occurring simultaneously with the closing of business combination 
or (ii) if we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, up 
to $10,000,000 worth of shares (at our offering price of $8.00 per share) 
in a private placement occurring simultaneously with the closing of the 
business combination. These purchases will be made only when the sponsors 
are not in possession of any material non-public information and will 
otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M which may 
prohibit purchases under certain circumstances. The price per share at 
which such purchases will be made will not be more than the per-share amount 
held in the trust account (less taxes payable) as reported in the preliminary 
proxy statement. These purchases may commence two business days after we file 
a preliminary proxy statement relating to our initial business combination and 
end on the business day immediately preceding the record date for the meeting 
of shareholders at which such initial business combination is to be approved 
or at such time the purchases reach the maximum set by our sponsors, not to 
exceed $10,000,000 in total. Our sponsors will not have any discretion or 
influence over these purchases other than the decision as to whether to 
undertake any purchases at all. Our sponsors have agreed to vote any ordinary 
shares purchased in the open market in favor of our initial business 
combination, representing a maximum of approximately 25% of the public 
shares entitled to vote on the business combination. Unless our initial 
business combination is approved by our shareholders, our sponsors have 
agreed not to resell these shares. However, our sponsors will be entitled to 
participate in any liquidating distributions with respect to the shares 
purchased in the open market in the event we do not consummate an initial 
business combination. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause 
our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the 
redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of 
our initial business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with 
the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and instead 
may search for an alternate business combination. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such 
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described 
herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to 
consummate our initial business combination within 18 (or 21) months, subject 
to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations 
(including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of 
the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public 
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust 
account. 

Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with 
respect to any founder shares and public shares in connection with the 
consummation of our initial business combination. Our officers and directors 
have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any public 
shares purchased during or after the offering in connection with the 
consummation of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial 
shareholders have agreed to waive their right to liquidating distributions 
with respect to their founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial 
business combination within 18 (or 21) months from the closing of this
offering. However, if our sponsors, or any of our officers, directors or 
affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be 
entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public 
shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 
the required time period."

approximately $80.8 million based on the initial public offering price of 
$26.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions 
and estimated offering expenses incurred by us. If the underwriters’ option to 
purchase additional shares in this offering from us is exercised in full, our 
estimated net proceeds will be approximately $93.5 million, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. 

While we do not have any current specific plans for the net proceeds resulting 
from this offering, we expect to use the net proceeds for working capital and 
other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the proceeds to 
expand our current business through acquisitions or investments in other 
strategic businesses, products or technologies. We have no commitments with 
respect to any such acquisitions or investments at this time. We will have 
broad discretion in the way we use the net proceeds, which will afford us 
significant flexibility to pursue our business strategies. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to raise additional working capital, 
create a public market for our Class A common stock for the benefit of our 
current stockholders, allow us easier and quicker access to the public markets 
should we need more capital in the future, increase the profile and prestige of
our company with existing and possible future travelers, vendors and strategic 
partners and make our stock more valuable and attractive to our employees and 
potential employees for compensation purposes. 

We intend to invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-
bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or 
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government, pending their use as described 
above."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $62.3 
million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to 
purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this
offering will be approximately $71.8 million. 

As of March 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25.3 
million. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with our cash and cash equivalents, as follows: 

   •   approximately $13 million to complete the clinical development of and 
       seek marketing approval in the United States and the European Union for 
       dalbavancin for the treatment of patients with abSSSI; 

   •   approximately $20 million to fund commercial activities for dalbavancin 
       in the United States and Western Europe, if it is approved for the 
       treatment of patients with abSSSI; 

   •   approximately $15 million to fund the scale up of the manufacturing of 
       dalbavancin in preparation for commercial launch; 

   •   approximately $10 million to pursue the development of dalbavancin in 
       additional indications; and 

   •   the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, 
       which may include the in-licensing or acquisition of other products or 
       technologies. 
 
This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash 
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our 
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from 
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with 
third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a 
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the 
net proceeds from this offering. We have no current understandings, agreements 
or commitments for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products, 
businesses or technologies. 

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our 
existing cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete the clinical development of, to seek 
marketing approval in the United States and the European Union for, and, if 
approved for the treatment of patients with abSSSI, to commercially launch 
dalbavancin in the United States and Western Europe. We have based this 
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our 
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. This estimate 
assumes, among other things, that, at our sole discretion pursuant to the terms
of our agreement with Pfizer, we elect to defer for a period of up to five 
years payment of the $25 million milestone that we will become obligated to pay
upon the first commercial sale of dalbavancin by delivering to Pfizer a 
promissory note for such amount. Interest on the outstanding principal amount 
of the promissory note will accrue at a rate of 10% per annum, compounded 
annually. 

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government 
securities."

stock in this offering of approximately $72.0 million based upon the initial 
public offering price of $17.00 per share and after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We 
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by 
the selling shareholders, which includes certain of our officers, directors 
and affiliates, including any shares sold by the selling shareholders in 
connection with the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase 
additional shares. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay at least $50.0 
million of outstanding indebtedness under our new term loan facility which 
was incurred in connection with the Financing Transactions. 

We intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, 
including working capital. 

On May 16, 2012, we entered into our $100.0 million term loan facility with
a syndicate of lenders which bears interest, at our option, at an alternate 
base rate which is the greater of (i) the administrative agent’s prime rate 
in effect on such day and (ii) the federal funds effective rate in effect on 
such day plus 0.50% with a 2.00% floor, plus a margin of 3.25%, or a 
LIBOR-based rate with a 1.00% floor plus a margin of 4.25%; provided, that 
if no initial public offering occurs prior to May 16, 2013 and our 
consolidated net leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the applicable 
margin for the alternate base rate shall be 4.75% and for the LIBOR-based 
rate shall be 5.75%. At July 17, 2012 our interest rate was 5.25% and our 
outstanding balance was $100.0 million. The term loan facility matures on 
the earlier of (i) May 16, 2015 and (ii) the date on which such facility 
is accelerated following the occurrence of an event of default; provided, 
that if no initial public offering occurs prior to May 16, 2013, the term 
loan facility shall mature on the earlier of (i) May 16, 2014 and (ii) the 
date on which such facility is accelerated following the occurrence of an 
event of default. 

We used the amounts of the net proceeds from our term loan facility of $98.0 
million and cash on hand to pay a special dividend of approximately $37.0 
million to holders of our common stock and approximately $62.5 million to 
holders of our Series A 8% convertible preferred stock. Advent and LLR 
Partners, our principal shareholders, received distributions in respect 
of this dividend in the amounts of approximately $62.2 million and $9.5 
million, respectively. In addition, certain of our current executive 
officers and directors received distributions in respect of this dividend 
as follows: Messrs. Bull, Ryan, Sargent, Schlessinger and Vellios received 
approximately $193,000, $322,000, $529,000, $5.6 million and $5.6 million,

proceeds sufficient for the bank to have at least 10% tangible capital upon 
completion of the offering. In no event will less than 50% of the net proceeds
be transferred to 1st Security Bank of Washington in exchange for its shares.

stock of 1st Security Bank of Washington will be added to the bank’s general 
funds for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds 1st Security Bank of 
Washington receives from FS Bancorp are initially intended to be invested into 
short-term liquid investments. In addition, a majority of the net proceeds 
retained by FS Bancorp, excluding the amount needed to fund the loan to the 
employee stock ownership plan, is expected to be deposited with 1st Security 
Bank of Washington as deposits, providing additional funds for reinvestment in 
earning assets.

offering, nor have they allocated a specific portion of the proceeds to any 
particular use. 
  
FS Bancorp intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to make a loan directly
to the employee stock ownership plan to enable it to purchase up to 8% of the 
aggregate shares of common stock sold in the offering; or, alternatively, 
subject to regulatory approval, in the open market after the conversion. Based
upon the sale of 2,082,500 and 2,817,500 shares of common stock in the offering
at the minimum and maximum of the estimated offering range, respectively, the 
loan to the FS Bancorp employee stock ownership plan would be $1.7 million and 
$2.3 million, respectively.  
  
Within one year after completion of the offering, FS Bancorp intends to adopt 
an equity incentive plan, subject to shareholder approval, and use a portion of
its proceeds to fund the purchase of shares in the open market for the plan, 
subject to prior written non-objection from the Washington Department of 
Financial Institutions. The equity incentive plan intends to purchase in the 
open market 4% of the aggregate shares sold in the offering, or $833,000 and 
$1.1 million at the minimum and maximum of the estimated offering range, 
respectively. 
  
The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion may be more 
or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of 
shares to be issued in the conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in the 
estimated pro forma market value of 1st Security Bank of Washington. Payments 
for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at 1st 
Security Bank of Washington will not result in the receipt of new funds for 
investment by 1st Security Bank of Washington but will result in a reduction 
of 1st Security Bank of Washington’s interest expense and liabilities as funds 
are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or other deposit accounts."

FS Bancorp will purchase all of the capital stock of 1st Security Bank of 
Washington to be issued in the offering in exchange for an amount of net 
proceeds sufficient for the bank to have at least 10% tangible capital upon 
completion of the offering. In no event will less than 50% of the net proceeds
be transferred to 1st Security Bank of Washington in exchange for its shares.
The portion of the net proceeds used by FS Bancorp to purchase the capital 
stock of 1st Security Bank of Washington will be added to the bank’s general 
funds for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds 1st Security Bank of 
Washington receives from FS Bancorp are initially intended to be invested into 
short-term liquid investments. In addition, a majority of the net proceeds 
retained by FS Bancorp, excluding the amount needed to fund the loan to the 
employee stock ownership plan, is expected to be deposited with 1st Security 
Bank of Washington as deposits, providing additional funds for reinvestment in 
earning assets.

termination of our Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of Parthenon

this offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will 
be approximately $79.2 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the 
sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. In connection 
with our initial public offering, eight employees are exercising options 
and selling a total of 159,220 shares issued upon exercise of these options. 
All of the options that are being exercised would otherwise expire during 
the 180-day lock-up period, when the holders would not be able to sell the 
shares, and therefore these holders are exercising these options and we are 
allowing them to sell these shares in our initial public offering. 

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes. While we have not allocated 
the net proceeds of this offering to specified general corporate purposes, 
we may utilize such proceeds by allocating them amongst the following 
categories: finance our growth; develop new products; assert and defend our 
intellectual property rights; and fund capital expenditures. In addition, 
we may choose to repay our loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank or expand 
our current business through acquisitions of other businesses, products, or 
technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any 
specific acquisitions at this time. Our loan facility with Silicon Valley 
Bank provides us with a revolving line of credit and also an equipment line. 
The revolving line of credit has a maturity date of December 30, 2014, and 
carries an annual interest rate equal to the prime rate plus 0.50%, subject 
to an interest rate floor of 3.75% and an interest rate ceiling of 7.50%. 
The equipment line is available until December 31, 2012 and has a maturity 
date of 36 months from the date of each draw. The equipment line carries an 
annual interest rate equal to 4.75%. 

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts 
we actually expend in these areas may vary significantly from our current 
intentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including future sales 
growth, success of our engineering efforts, cash generated from future 
operations, if any, and actual expenses to operate our business. As of the 
date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the 
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of 
this offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in 
the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the 
judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds 
of this offering. 

Pending use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds 
in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term, 
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our
business, although we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the cash used in or generated by our operations, the status
of our development, and the level of our product development and our marketing

management will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from
this offering. Pending the above uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from
this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities, such
as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and

      funds we received from Laurence S. Levy and Edward Levy described below. 
      These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available
      to us.  

 (2)  We have agreed to pay the underwriters deferred commissions in an amount 
      equal to approximately $0.28 per share, or $2,062,500 in the aggregate 
      (or approximately $2,371,875 in the aggregate if the over-allotment 
      option is exercised in full), from our trust account upon closing of our 
      initial business combination, as described in this prospectus. The amount
      of any aggregate deferred commissions paid to the underwriters will be 
      reduced by the amount of any deferred commission earned on shares which 
      have been converted, tendered or repurchased prior to or in connection 
      with the completion of our initial business combination. The deferred 
      commissions will be released to the underwriters only on completion of 
      our initial business combination, as described in this prospectus.  

 (3)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of

 (4)  The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant

      interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after 
      payment of taxes owed on such interest income) will be available to us to
      pay for our working capital requirements. We estimate the interest earned
      on the trust account will be approximately $375,000 over a 21-month 
      period assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.27% per year.  

 (5)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
      all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
      example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our 
      current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our 
      initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of that 
      business combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
      of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
      allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
      estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from 
      our excess working capital.  

Our sponsors have committed that they and/or their designees will purchase the 
sponsors’ shares (for an aggregate purchase price of $6,937,500) from us on a 
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. 
All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust
account described below. 

$78,750,000, or $89,746,875 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, 
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the sponsors’ shares, 
including the deferred commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the 
United States at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, maintained by Continental Stock 
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in the
trust account will be invested only in United States government treasury bills 
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an 
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (1)
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to 
us to pay our income or other tax obligations and (2) interest earned on the 
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working 
capital requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account 
until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our 
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a 
business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the 
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target 
business with which we complete our initial business combination. Any amounts 
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to 
finance operations of the target business. 

The payment to ProChannel Management LLC, an affiliate of Laurence S. Levy, of 
a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including 
office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being 
agreed to by ProChannel Management LLC for our benefit and is not intended to 
provide Laurence S. Levy with compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, 
based on rents and fees for similar services in New York City, that the fee 
charged by ProChannel Management LLC is at least as favorable as we could have 
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon 
completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no 
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees or other 
similar compensation) will be paid to our sponsors, members of our management 
team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us 
prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business 
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such 
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred 
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying 
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable 
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from 
the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to 
examine their operations. Since the role of present management after our 
initial business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business 
combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net 
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working 
capital requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be 
approximately $1,000,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be 
released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for our 
initial business combination. We intend to use the after-tax interest earned 
for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with
our search for a target business and for director and officer liability 
insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due 
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating 
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsors, officers and directors in 
connection with activities on our behalf as described below. 

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust 
account, along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these 
funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may 
reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories. If our 
estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our
initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so,
or the amount of interest available to use from the trust account is 
insufficient as a result of the current low interest rate environment, we may 
be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of 
which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such 
additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our 
management team, but such members of our management team are not under any 
obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. 

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, 
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is 
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business 
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to 
consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and
will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working 
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital 
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the 
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, 
research and development of existing or new products. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay 
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust 
account. If such funds are insufficient, our officers have agreed to pay the 
funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no 
more than $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. 

As of the date of this prospectus, Laurence S. Levy and Edward Levy have loaned
to us an aggregate of $100,000 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of 
this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, 
FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans are payable without
interest on the earlier of (i) April 27, 2013, (ii) the date on which we 
consummate our initial public offering or (iii) the date on which we determine 
to not proceed with our initial public offering. The loans will be repaid out 
of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering 
expenses. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the 
trust account) to operate for the next 21 months, assuming that our initial 
business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if 
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the 
consummation of this offering, our sponsors, officers and directors may, but 
are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in 
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would 
be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon 
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the 
lender’s discretion, the notes may be converted into shares of common stock at 
a price of $10.00 per share. If we do not complete our initial business 
combination, the loans will be forgiven. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to 
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (1) our 
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a 
business combination in the required time period or (2) if that public 
stockholder elects to convert shares of common stock in connection with a 
stockholder vote or sells such shares to us in a tender offer. In no other 
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind 
to or in the trust account."

be approximately $71.8 million, based on the initial public offering price of 
$12.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, our net proceeds would be approximately $84.5 
million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale
of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital and 
increase our financial flexibility, improve our visibility in the marketplace, 
create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to
the public equity markets. 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering 
for capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes,
which may include hiring additional personnel and investing in sales and 
marketing and research and development. In addition, we expect to spend 
approximately $20.0 million through December 31, 2013 for capital expenditures,
primarily related to infrastructure to support the anticipated growth in our 
business. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds that we receive from 
this offering to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, 
or other assets. We have not entered into any agreements or commitments with 
respect to any acquisitions or investments at this time. 

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds
that we receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion 
in using these proceeds. Furthermore, the amount and timing of our actual 
expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the cash used in or 
generated by our operations, the status of our development, the level of our 
sales and marketing activities, and our technology investments and 
acquisitions. Our management also has discretion over many of these factors. 
Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to 
invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term and 
intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade investments, 
certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government. We cannot predict whether the invested proceeds will yield a 
favorable return."

deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and a structuring fee, but 
before paying offering expenses, from the issuance and sale of common units 
offered by this prospectus. We will use the net proceeds from this 
offering to: 

. repay $140.0 million outstanding under our amended and restated revolving 
  credit facility; 

. make a cash distribution to Summit Investments of $88.0 million in order to 
  reimburse Summit Investments for certain capital expenditures it incurred 
  with respect to assets it contributed to us; and 

. pay estimated offering expenses of $6.3 million. 

As of September 13, 2012, we had $344.2 million of indebtedness outstanding 
under our revolving credit facility, with a weighted average interest rate 
of 2.76%. The amended and restated revolving credit facility matures on 
May 26, 2016, and borrowings bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal 
to either LIBOR, plus the applicable margins ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%, or 
at a base rate, plus the applicable margins ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%. 
Borrowings made under our amended and restated revolving credit facility 
within the last twelve months were used primarily to make distributions to 
our sponsors and fund capital expenditures. 

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units, 
we will use the net proceeds from that exercise to redeem from Summit 
Investments the number of common units issued upon such exercise. 

The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and 
perform services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business. 
Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our amended and 
restated revolving credit facility and will, in that respect, receive a 
portion of the proceeds from this offering through the repayment of 
borrowings outstanding under our amended and restated revolving credit 
facility."

 (1)  As of March 15, 2012, $85,000 of the offering expenses have been paid 
      from the proceeds of the loan described below, and $25,000 remains in our
      bank account. In addition, as of March 15, 2012, management has not 
      incurred any reimbursable offering expenses that will be reimbursed by us
      following completion of this offering for items such as travel, 
      translation cost, and administrative expenses. The offering expenses will
      be funded from the proceeds of this offering including the pre-paid 
      portions. Accordingly, the $85,000 borrowed from Aqua Investments Corp., 
      our sponsor, being used to pre-pay our offering expenses will be repaid 
      without interest from the proceeds of this offering.  

 (2)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the sale of the 
      placement units. For purposes of presentation, the current portion of 
      underwriting discounts and commissions are reflected as the amount 
      payable to the underwriters upon consummation of the offering. An 
      additional $1,250,000, or $1,437,500 if the over-allotment option is 
      exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in the trust account 
      following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the 
      underwriters only if and when we consummate an acquisition transaction.  

 (3)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
      all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.  

 (4)  If an acquisition transaction is consummated, we will owe Loeb & Loeb LLP
      $75,000 at the closing of the acquisition transaction. We shall pay this 
      fee from our expense budget, interest we earn on the trust or potentially
      from other capital we may raise, but not from proceeds held in trust.  

 (5)  The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant
      at $250,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. For purposes of 
      presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total 
      amount of net proceeds available to us. In the event that our operating 
      expenses exceed the working capital available to us from net proceeds not
      held in trust account and interest earned on monies held in the trust 
      account (any amounts in the trust account in excess of $10.30 per public 
      share), our founders may fund any working capital requirements through 
      loans to be paid back upon the consummation of an acquisition 
      transaction.

 (6)  Seacrest Shipping Co. Ltd. has agreed to defer the payment of the $7,500 
      monthly fee after 4 months until an acquisition transaction is completed.
 
In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our founders and their
designees have committed to purchase the placement units from us for an 
aggregate purchase price of $3,377,500 (or $3,790,000 if the over-allotment 
option is exercised in full). These purchases will take place on a private 
placement basis immediately prior to the consummation of this offering. We will
not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the 
placement units. All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be 
placed in the trust account described below. 

A total of approximately $51,500,000 (or approximately $59,225,000 if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds 
from this offering and the sale of the placement units described in this 
prospectus, including $1,250,000 (or $1,437,500 if the underwriters’ over-
allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts and 
commissions, will be placed in a trust account at Barclays in London with 
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company as trustee. We expect that the trust 
assets will be held in an account located outside of the United States. Net 
proceeds of this offering in the amount of $250,000 will not be held in the 
trust account. 

Except as described below and for any amounts paid to redeeming stockholders in
connection with our initial acquisition transaction, the proceeds held in the 
trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of 
the consummation of an acquisition transaction or our liquidation. All amounts 
held in the trust account that are not: 

 •  distributed to stockholders who exercise redemption rights;  

 •  released to us for working capital purposes and general corporate 
    requirements (any amount in the trust account in excess of $10.30 per 
    public share);  

 •  released to us to pay taxes; or  

 •  payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting discounts and 
    commissions, 

will be released to us upon consummation of our initial acquisition 
transaction. 

Our initial acquisition transaction will be with one or more acquisition 
targets that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the 
trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of 
$1,250,000, or $1,437,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, and taxes payable) at the time of such acquisition 
transaction, subject to: 

 •  no more than 90% of the public stockholders (or such lower percentage as a 
    target business may require) electing to exercise their redemption rights; 
    and  

 •  such deferred underwriting discounts and commissions having been paid to 
    the underwriters.  

Our initial acquisition transaction must be with one or more acquisition 
targets whose fair market value, individually or collectively, is equal to at 
least 80% of the balance held in our trust account (excluding deferred 
underwriting discounts and commissions of $1,250,000, or $1,437,500 if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, and taxes payable) at
the time of such acquisition. The fair market value of the acquisition target 
will be determined by our board of directors based upon an analysis conducted 
by them (which may include an analysis of actual and potential sales, 
earnings, cash flow and/or book value). We anticipate structuring an 
acquisition transaction to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of 
the acquisition target. We may, however, structure an acquisition transaction 
to acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business, 
but will not acquire less than a controlling interest and will in all instances
be the controlling stockholder of the acquisition target. The key factors that 
we will rely on in determining controlling stockholder status would be our 
acquisition of more than 50% of the voting rights of the acquisition target and
control of the majority of any governing body of the acquisition target. We 
will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even though
we will own at least a majority interest in the target, our stockholders prior 
to the acquisition transaction may collectively own a minority interest in the 
post-acquisition transaction company depending on valuations ascribed to the 
target and us in the acquisition transaction. For example, we could pursue a 
transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange 
for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. As a result of the 
issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately 
prior to our initial acquisition transaction could own less than a majority of 
our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial acquisition transaction. 

Upon release of funds from the trust account, and after payment of the 
redemption price to any stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and 
the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to the underwriters, the 
remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion 
of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial 
acquisition transaction occurs. If the initial acquisition transaction is paid 
for using equity or debt securities or additional funds from a private offering
of debt or equity securities or borrowings, we may apply the cash released to 
us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for 
maintenance or expansion of operations of the acquired business or businesses, 
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating our initial acquisition transaction, to fund the purchase of other
companies, or for working capital. 

Aqua Investments Corp., our sponsor, has loaned us $85,650, which amount was 
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering. The loan will be 
payable without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loan will be
repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. 

We have agreed to pay to Seacrest Shipping Co. Ltd. a total of $7,500 per month
for office space, administrative services and secretarial support for a period 
commencing on the date of this prospectus and ending on the earlier of our 
consummation of an acquisition transaction or our liquidation. Seacrest 
Shipping Co. Ltd. is the agent of Remi Maritime Corp., an affiliate of our 
founders. This arrangement was agreed to by Seacrest Shipping Co. Ltd. and our 
founders for our benefit and is not intended to provide our founders 
compensation in lieu of a management fee or other remuneration because it is 
anticipated that the expenses to be paid by Seacrest Shipping Co. Ltd. will 
approximate the monthly reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least 
as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Seacrest 
Shipping Co. Ltd. has agreed that after 4 months the monthly fee will begin to 
accrue and will only be payable thereafter upon completion of an acquisition 
transaction. Upon consummation of an acquisition transaction or our 
liquidation, we will cease paying or accruing these monthly fees. 

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income 
that may be released to us (all amounts in the trust fund account in excess of 
$10.30 per public share) and will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses 
to which such proceeds are allocated for up to 21 months. Our estimates are 
based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken only after we 
have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement 
that addresses the terms of an acquisition transaction. However, if our 
estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating 
an acquisition transaction is lower than the actual amount necessary to do so, 
or in the event the amounts not held in the trust account is insufficient to 
pay our costs and expenses, we may be required to raise additional capital, the
amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable, through 
loans or additional investments from our founders or our officers and 
directors. None of our founders, officers or directors is under any obligation 
to advance funds to, or invest in, us. 

The net proceeds from this offering and the private placement of the placement 
units that are not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will 
be invested only in United States government treasury bills having a maturity 
of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under 
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest 
solely in U.S. treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment 
company under the Investment Company Act. 

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, and any share options issued to our officers, directors, 
employees, and/or consultants, we will not pay fees of any kind (including 
finder’s and consulting fees) to any of our officers, and directors, or any of 
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with 
the consummation of the acquisition transaction. However, our officers, and 
directors and their respective affiliates will receive reimbursement for any 
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with 
identifying, investigating and consummating a potential acquisition transaction
with one of more acquisition targets. There are no limitations on the amount of
expenses for which they can seek reimbursement, provided such expenses were 
incurred for our benefit. Additionally, we may engage market research firms 
and/or third-party consultants. Our board of directors will have the 
responsibility of reviewing and approving all expense reimbursements made to 
our founders, officers or directors, and their respective affiliates, with any 
interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. To 
the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in 
the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us 
unless we consummate an acquisition transaction. These expenses would be a 
liability of the post-combination business and would be treated in a manner 
similar to any other account payable of the combined business. Our officers 
and directors may, as part of any such acquisition transaction, negotiate the 
repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the acquisition target’ 
owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our directors to view 
such potential acquisition transaction unfavorably and result in a conflict of 
interest. Although we currently expect that the members of our management team 
will become a part of the management team of the combined entity, since the 
actual role of each present member of management after an acquisition 
transaction is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after an acquisition 
transaction. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only in the event of (i) our liquidation if we fail to consummate our initial 
acquisition transaction within the allotted time, or (ii) if the public 
stockholder seeks to have us redeem such shares for cash in connection with an 
acquisition transaction that that was actually consummated. In no other 
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind 
in or to the funds in the trust account. 

Upon consummation of our initial acquisition transaction, the underwriters will
receive the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions held in the trust 
account. The underwriters will not receive the deferred underwriting discount 
with respect to those units as to which the component shares have been redeemed
for cash. If we do not complete an initial acquisition transaction and the 
trustee therefore distributes the balance in the trust account upon our 
liquidation, the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims 
to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any 
accrued interest thereon, in the trust account and (ii) that the trustee is 
authorized to distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, 
together with any accrued interest thereon, net of (i) interest earned on the 
trust account that may be released to us to pay any taxes we incur, and (ii) 
interest earned by the trust account that may be released to us from time to 
time to fund our working capital and general corporate requirements (any 
amounts in the trust account in excess of $10.30 per public share), to the 
public stockholders on a pro rata basis."

Fund’s investment objective as stated in this prospectus. Upon receipt, the 
Fund will use all of the net proceeds to invest in commodity futures 
contracts and options on commodity futures contracts, and cash equivalents, 
U.S. government securities and other short-term, high grade debt securities 
constituting collateral assets. The manager has sole authority to determine 
the percentage of assets that will be: 

. held on deposit with the commodity broker or other custodian, 

. used for other investments, and 

. held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves. 

The commodity subadvisor and the collateral subadvisor expect to deposit a 
portion of the Fund’s net assets with the commodity broker or other custodian 
as initial margin for investments. It is presently anticipated that the Fund 
will be able to invest substantially all of its net proceeds in accordance 
with its investment objective within approximately 30 business days after the 
completion of the offering. Pending such investment, it is anticipated that 
the proceeds will be invested in cash and obligations issued or guaranteed by 
the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities. 

The Fund uses only short-term securities to satisfy margin requirements. The 
manager expects that all entities that will hold or invest the Fund’s assets 
will be based in the U.S. and will be subject to U.S. regulations. 

Approximately 15% to 25% of the Fund’s net assets will initially be committed 
as margin for commodity futures contracts (approximately half of which will 
be initial margin and the other half of which will be held to meet variation 
margin). All of the margin will be held at BCI in an interest-bearing cash 
account or invested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government, its agencies or instrumentalities. The notional value of the 
Fund’s commodity futures contracts at the time of investment will not exceed 
100% of the liquidation value of the Fund’s assets. However, the percentage 
of assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than 15% to 
25% of the Fund’s assets. All interest income is used for the Fund’s benefit.

The clearing broker, government agency or any commodity exchange on which the 
Fund trades could increase margins applicable to the Fund to hold futures or 
options positions at any time."

sale of 17,300,000 common units offered by this prospectus, based on an 
initial public offering price of $22.00 per common unit, after deducting 
underwriting discounts, structuring fees and estimated offering expenses. We 
intend to use these proceeds as follows:  

. approximately $191.6 million will be contributed to Pipe Line Holdings, 
  which Pipe Line Holdings will retain on behalf of us and MPC to fund our 
  respective pro rata portions of certain estimated expansion capital 
  expenditures;   

. $148.3 million will be distributed to MPC, in partial consideration of its 
  contribution of assets to us and to reimburse MPC for certain capital 
  expenditures it incurred with respect to these assets;

. $10.0 million will be retained for general partnership purposes, including 
  to fund our working capital needs; and 
 
. $2.7 million will be used to pay revolving credit facility origination 
  fees. 

In connection with this offering, we have entered into a $500.0 million 
revolving credit facility. 

The net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to 
purchase additional common units will be used to redeem from MPC a number of 
common units equal to the number of common units issued upon exercise of the 
option at a price per common unit equal to the net proceeds per common unit 
in this offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts 
and the structuring fee. Accordingly, any exercise of the underwriters’ 
option will not affect the total number of units outstanding or the amount of 
cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all units."

offering price of $17.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discount, 
will be approximately $368 million. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us from 
this offering will be approximately $423 million. There can be no assurance 
as to whether or not the underwriters will exercise their over-allotment 
option. 

We will contribute $282 million of the net proceeds from this offering to WWF 
Operating Company and cause WWF Operating Company to use such proceeds, 
together with substantially all of the net proceeds of our initial borrowing 
under our senior secured credit facilities, to repay obligations under the 
intercompany notes owed to Dean Foods that are outstanding as of the 
completion of this offering. Dean Foods has advised us that it plans to use 
these funds to repay a portion of its indebtedness under its senior secured 
credit facility. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds of approximately 
$86 million from this offering, together with any net proceeds from the 
exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, to repay amounts 
outstanding under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit 
facilities. Transaction costs incurred in connection with this offering 
(other than the underwriting discount) will be paid by Dean Foods and do not 
impact the amount of net proceeds from this offering. These costs primarily 
include costs related to legal, accounting, and consulting services."

intend to use approximately $1,500,000 of the proceeds to purchase and 
install an evaporator at our Sombra plant that will allow us to recycle 
methanol that can be reused in the production process, to add additional 
storage tanks for feedstock and for biodiesel produced at the plant, and to 
upgrade part of our rail track system to provide greater flexibility in 
loading and unloading tank cars. 

Marketing and sales expenses. We intend to use approximately $300,000 in

computer-linked network of biodiesel producers and the sale of Denami 
processors to new network members and to support the marketing and sale of 
processors in Europe, Asia and North and South America. These expenses may 
include appearances at trade shows, advertising in trade publications and 
additional sales personnel. 

Working Capital. We intend to use $484,000 of the proceeds for capital 
expenditures and working capital required for general corporate purposes, 
including the potential addition of processors at our Sombra plant, 
increasing investments in marketing, and acquiring or constructing one or 
more additional processing facilities. Working capital may also be used to 
support new production facilities until they generate positive cash flow. If 
the representative exercises the over-allotment option, we intend to add the 
additional net proceeds of approximately $382,200 to our working capital. 

As of the date of this prospectus, except as set forth above, we cannot 
predict with certainty all of the uses for the proceeds of this offering. We 
will retain flexibility in the application of the net proceeds. The amounts 
actually expended for these purposes may vary significantly and will depend 
on a number of factors, including our rate of revenue growth, cash generated

CROSSAMERICA PARTNERS LP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/crossamerica-partners-lp-881757-69895,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/crossamerica-partners-lp-881757-69895,424B4,10/26/2012,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=8880814,"We expect the net proceeds from our sale of 6,000,000 common units in this 
offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts, the structuring fee and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $105.6 
million based on an assumed offering price of $20.00 per common unit. We base 
this amount on an assumed initial public offering price of $20.00 per common 
unit and no exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional common 
units. An increase or decrease in the initial public offering price of $1.00 
per common unit would cause the net proceeds from the offering, after 
deducting the underwriting discount, structuring fee and offering expenses 
payable by us, to increase or decrease by approximately $5.6 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering: 

. to repay $57.9 million of indebtedness outstanding under the new credit 
  facility, which will be drawn upon at the completion of this offering in 
  order to repay in full our existing credit agreement; 

. to repay in full $14.3 million aggregate principal amount in outstanding 
  mortgage notes; 

. to pay $13.0 million to entities owned by adult children of Warren S. 
  Kimber, Jr., a director of our general partner, as consideration for the 
  cancellation of mandatorily redeemable preferred equity of our predecessor 
  owned by these entities and to pay these entities for accrued but unpaid 
  dividends on the mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ($0.4 million as of 
  September 30, 2012); 

. to distribute an aggregate $20.0 million cash to the Topper Group and LGC as 
  reimbursement for certain capital expenditures made by the Topper Group and 
  LGC with respect to the assets they contributed, and/or consideration for 
  the purchase of all of the assets of one or more of the contributed 
  entities; and 

. to use for general partnership purposes, including working capital and 
  acquisitions. 

Immediately following the completion of this offering, we expect to have 
available undrawn borrowing capacity of approximately $83.1 million under the 
new credit facility based on an assumed offering price of $20.00 per common 
unit (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this 
prospectus). Borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and term 
loan were primarily made in connection with our working capital needs and to 
finance acquisitions. As of June 30, 2012, we had borrowings outstanding of
$164.5 million under our existing credit agreement, an aggregate of $14.3 
million under mortgage notes and $12.0 million of mandatorily redeemable 
preferred equity. Indebtedness under the existing revolving credit facility 
and term loan bore interest at an average rate of approximately 3.2%, the 
mortgage notes bore interest at a weighted average rate of 4.0% and dividends 
were paid on the mandatorily redeemable preferred equity at a rate of 12% 
during the six months ended June 30, 2012. The existing credit agreement will 
mature on December 30, 2015, but will be amended and restated in connection 
with the offering, pursuant to which the term loan will be terminated and the 
existing credit facility will be repaid in full using the proceeds from the 
new credit agreement, consisting of a three-year $200 million senior secured 
credit facility which may be increased to $275 million if certain conditions 
are met.

We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 900,000 
additional common units. If the underwriters do not exercise their option to 
purchase additional common units, we will issue 900,000 common units to the 
Topper Group at the expiration of the 30-day option period. If and to the 
extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common 
units, the number of units purchased by the underwriters pursuant to any 
exercise will be sold to the public, and the remainder, if any will be issued 
to the Topper Group at the expiration of the option period. The exercise of 
the underwriters' option will not affect the total number of units outstanding 
or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all 
units. To the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional units, an amount equal to the net proceeds from the issuance and 
sale of those common units will be distributed to the Topper Group. We expect 
that the net proceeds received from the exercise of the underwriters' option 
to purchase additional common units in full after deducting the underwriting 
discounts and the structuring fee will be $16.7 million based on an assumed 
offering price of $20.00 per common unit (the midpoint of the price range set 
forth on the cover page of this prospectus). 

Raymond James Bank, N.A., an affiliate of Raymond James & Associates, Inc., 
will be a lender under our new credit facility. A portion of the net proceeds 
from this offering will be used either to repay the borrowings extended under 
the new credit facility or to reduce the amounts the lenders will initially 
fund to repay the existing credit facility."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been prepaid from the proceeds of 
    an aggregate of $100,000 of loans from our management team, as described 
    in this prospectus. The loans will be repaid without interest upon the 
    closing of this offering out of the amount of offering proceeds that has 
    been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than 
    underwriting commissions. 

(2) The underwriting discount of 1.5% is payable at the closing of the 
    offering and the deferred corporate finance fee of 3.0% payable to The 
    PrinceRidge Group LLC is payable upon consummation of our initial business 
    combination and will be held in the trust account until consummation of 
    such business combination. No discounts or commissions will be paid with 
    respect to the purchase of the insider warrants. 

(3) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of that business 
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of 
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from 
    our excess working capital. 

A total of $41,400,000 ($47,310,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option 
is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of 
the insider warrants described in this prospectus, including $1,200,000 
($1,380,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) 
deferred corporate finance fee payable to The PrinceRidge Group LLC, will be 
placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company 
acting as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills 
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in registered money market funds 
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act 
and that invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for the interest income that
may be released to us to pay any taxes and to fund our working capital 
requirements, as discussed below, none of the funds held in trust will be 
released from the trust account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of 
our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this 
offering (or 18 months if we take advantage of the full 90-day extension), 
(ii) the redemption of shares held by public shareholders that seek to redeem 
their shares in connection with us taking advantage of the 90-day extension 
and (iii) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares in the 
event we do not consummate our initial business combination within this time 
period. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to 
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our 
initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for 
using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the 
trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with 
our business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust 
account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate 
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired 
businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred 
in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of 
other companies or for working capital. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income that 
may be released to fund our working capital requirements in addition to the 
loans discussed below, will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to 
which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that 
while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth 
due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business 
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth 
due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than 
the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to 
use from the trust account is less than $75,000 as a result of the current 
interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, 
the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, one or more of our initial 
shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not 
obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Each loan would be evidenced 
by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our 
initial business combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s 
discretion, up to $500,000 may be converted into warrants at a price of $0.75 
per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the insider warrants. The 
promissory notes will provide that if we do not complete a business 
combination, the amounts represented by such promissory notes will be 
forgiven. 

The payment to Collabrium Advisors LLP, an affiliate of Andrew Williams, our 
Chairman of the Board, and Eureka Company Limited, an affiliate of Koji Fusa, 
our Chief Executive Officer, of an aggregate monthly fee of $7,500 is for 
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and 
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Collabrium 
Advisors LLP and Eureka Company Limited for our benefit and is not intended to 
provide Messrs. Williams or Fusa compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, 
based on rents and fees for similar services in London and Tokyo, that the 
fee charged by Collabrium Advisors LLP and Eureka Company Limited is at least 
as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party. This 
arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business 
combination or the redemption of our public shares if we have not completed 
our initial business combination within the required time period. Other than 
the $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s, 
consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our initial 
shareholders, officers, directors or any of their affiliates prior to, or for 
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the 
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such 
as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence 
on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling 
to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target 
businesses to examiner their operations. 

As of the date of this prospectus, our management team has loaned and 
advanced to us a total of $100,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses 
of this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are 
due at the earlier of (i) April 15, 2013, (ii) the closing of this offering 
or (iii) the date on which we determine not to proceed with our initial 
public offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering 
out of the amount of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment 
of offering expenses. 

If we are no longer an FPI and seek shareholder approval of our initial 
business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our 
business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, we may enter into 
privately negotiated transactions to purchase public shares from shareholders 
following our consummation of our initial business combination with proceeds 
released to us from the trust account immediately following consummation of 
our initial business combination. Our initial shareholder, directors, 
officers, advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately 
negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our 
initial business combination. Neither we nor our directors, officers, 
advisors or their affiliates will make any such purchases when we or they are 
in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the 
seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange 
Act. Although we do not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase 
price (over the trust value) for such public shares, in the event we do, the 
payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of those shareholders 
not receiving any such premium because such shareholders may experience a 
reduction in book value per share compared to the value received by 
shareholders that have their shares purchased by us at a premium. 
Nevertheless, because any payment of a premium by us will be made only from 
proceeds released to us from the trust account following completion of a 
business combination, no such payments will reduce the per share amounts 
available in the trust account for redemption in connection with the business 
combination. There is no limit on the amount of shares that could be acquired 
by us after our initial business combination or by our affiliates prior to or 
after our initial business combination, or the price we or they may pay, if 
we hold a shareholder vote. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause 
our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the 
redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our 
initial business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the 
redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may 
search for an alternate business combination. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such 
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described 
herein, (ii) the redemption of public shares by holders that seek to have 
their shares redeemed in connection with our taking advantage of the 90-day 
extension or (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to 
consummate our initial business combination within 15 months following the 
closing of this offering (or 18 months if we have taken advantage of the 
90-day extension), subject to applicable law and as further described herein 
and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created 
by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances 
will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the 
trust account. 

Our initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive their 
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares in 
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. In 
addition, our initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed to 
waive their right to liquidating distributions with respect to the founder 
shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 15 
months from the closing of this offering (or 18 months if we take advantage 
of the full 90-day extension). However, if our initial shareholders, or any 
of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after 
this offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions 
with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial 
business combination within the required time period."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been prepaid from the proceeds of 
    an aggregate of $100,000 of loans from our management team, as described 
    in this prospectus. The loans will be repaid without interest upon the 
    closing of this offering out of the amount of offering proceeds that has 
    been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than 
    underwriting commissions. 

(2) The underwriting discount of 1.5% is payable at the closing of the 
    offering and the deferred corporate finance fee of 3.0% payable to The 
    PrinceRidge Group LLC is payable upon consummation of our initial business 
    combination and will be held in the trust account until consummation of 
    such business combination. No discounts or commissions will be paid with 
    respect to the purchase of the insider warrants. 

(3) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of that business 
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of 
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from 
    our excess working capital. 

A total of $41,400,000 ($47,310,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option 
is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of 
the insider warrants described in this prospectus, including $1,200,000 
($1,380,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) 
deferred corporate finance fee payable to The PrinceRidge Group LLC, will be 
placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company 
acting as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills 
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in registered money market funds 
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act 
and that invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for the interest income that
may be released to us to pay any taxes and to fund our working capital 
requirements, as discussed below, none of the funds held in trust will be 
released from the trust account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of 
our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this 
offering (or 18 months if we take advantage of the full 90-day extension), 
(ii) the redemption of shares held by public shareholders that seek to redeem 
their shares in connection with us taking advantage of the 90-day extension 
and (iii) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares in the 
event we do not consummate our initial business combination within this time 
period. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to 
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our 
initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for 
using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the 
trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with 
our business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust 
account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate 
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired 
businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred 
in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of 
other companies or for working capital. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income that 
may be released to fund our working capital requirements in addition to the 
loans discussed below, will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to 
which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that 
while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth 
due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business 
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth 
due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than 
the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to 
use from the trust account is less than $75,000 as a result of the current 
interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, 
the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, one or more of our initial 
shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not 
obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Each loan would be evidenced 
by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our 
initial business combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s 
discretion, up to $500,000 may be converted into warrants at a price of $0.75 
per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the insider warrants. The 
promissory notes will provide that if we do not complete a business 
combination, the amounts represented by such promissory notes will be 
forgiven. 

The payment to Collabrium Advisors LLP, an affiliate of Andrew Williams, our 
Chairman of the Board, and Eureka Company Limited, an affiliate of Koji Fusa, 
our Chief Executive Officer, of an aggregate monthly fee of $7,500 is for 
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and 
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Collabrium 
Advisors LLP and Eureka Company Limited for our benefit and is not intended to 
provide Messrs. Williams or Fusa compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, 
based on rents and fees for similar services in London and Tokyo, that the 
fee charged by Collabrium Advisors LLP and Eureka Company Limited is at least 
as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party. This 
arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business 
combination or the redemption of our public shares if we have not completed 
our initial business combination within the required time period. Other than 
the $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s, 
consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our initial 
shareholders, officers, directors or any of their affiliates prior to, or for 
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the 
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such 
as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence 
on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling 
to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target 
businesses to examiner their operations. 

As of the date of this prospectus, our management team has loaned and 
advanced to us a total of $100,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses 
of this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are 
due at the earlier of (i) April 15, 2013, (ii) the closing of this offering 
or (iii) the date on which we determine not to proceed with our initial 
public offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering 
out of the amount of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment 
of offering expenses. 

If we are no longer an FPI and seek shareholder approval of our initial 
business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our 
business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, we may enter into 
privately negotiated transactions to purchase public shares from shareholders 
following our consummation of our initial business combination with proceeds 
released to us from the trust account immediately following consummation of 
our initial business combination. Our initial shareholder, directors, 
officers, advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately 
negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our 
initial business combination. Neither we nor our directors, officers, 
advisors or their affiliates will make any such purchases when we or they are 
in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the 
seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange 
Act. Although we do not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase 
price (over the trust value) for such public shares, in the event we do, the 
payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of those shareholders 
not receiving any such premium because such shareholders may experience a 
reduction in book value per share compared to the value received by 
shareholders that have their shares purchased by us at a premium. 
Nevertheless, because any payment of a premium by us will be made only from 
proceeds released to us from the trust account following completion of a 
business combination, no such payments will reduce the per share amounts 
available in the trust account for redemption in connection with the business 
combination. There is no limit on the amount of shares that could be acquired 
by us after our initial business combination or by our affiliates prior to or 
after our initial business combination, or the price we or they may pay, if 
we hold a shareholder vote. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause 
our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the 
redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our 
initial business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the 
redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may 
search for an alternate business combination. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such 
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described 
herein, (ii) the redemption of public shares by holders that seek to have 
their shares redeemed in connection with our taking advantage of the 90-day 
extension or (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to 
consummate our initial business combination within 15 months following the 
closing of this offering (or 18 months if we have taken advantage of the 
90-day extension), subject to applicable law and as further described herein 
and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created 
by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances 
will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the 
trust account. 

Our initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive their 
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares in 
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. In 
addition, our initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed to 
waive their right to liquidating distributions with respect to the founder 
shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 15 
months from the closing of this offering (or 18 months if we take advantage 
of the full 90-day extension). However, if our initial shareholders, or any 
of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after 
this offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions 
with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial 
business combination within the required time period."

estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and structuring fees and 
paying estimated offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds from 
this offering as consideration for the acquisition of our interest in OPCO. 
In addition to the net proceeds from this offering, Seadrill will also 
receive the following: 

• 16,065,025 common units and 16,543,350 subordinated units; 

• the incentive distribution rights; and 

• the Seadrill Member interest. 

We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,312,500

that we are offering will be approximately $595.5 million, or approximately 
$685.3 million if the underwriters exercise in full their right to purchase 
additional shares to cover over-allotments, based on the initial public 
offering price of $28.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public 
market for our Class A common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds to us 
from our initial public offering for working capital and other general
corporate purposes. We have no specific planned uses of the proceeds; 
however, we may use a portion of the proceeds to fund the expansion of our 
business. In addition, as of January 31, 2012, we had commitments under 
operating and capital leases and contractual commitments of approximately 
$36.2 million. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for these purposes. 
The amount of proceeds we use for these purposes, if any, will depend on the 
level of cash generated from our operations. Additionally, we may choose to 
expand our current business through acquisitions of or investments in other 
complementary businesses, technologies, or other assets, using cash or shares 
of our Class A common stock. However, we currently have no agreements or 
commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or investments at this 
time. 

Pending other uses, we intend to invest the proceeds in interest-bearing, 
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed 
obligations of the U.S. government, or hold as cash. We cannot predict whether 
the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return. Our management will have 
broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive from our 
initial public offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our 
management regarding the application of the net proceeds."

offering are estimated to be approximately $204.6 million, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The 
net proceeds would be approximately $235.3 million if the underwriters’ 
option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full. Following the 
closing of this offering, we intend to use: 

. $100.0 million of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding borrowings 
  under our revolving credit facility; 

. approximately $63.6 million to repay the Gulfport transaction note; 

. $30.0 million to repay the outstanding borrowings under our subordinated 
  note with an affiliate of Wexford; and 

. approximately $8.4 million to settle the existing crude oil swaps. 

We intend to use the balance of the proceeds from this offering to fund a 
portion of our exploration and development activities and for general 
corporate purposes, which may include leasehold interest and property 
acquisitions, working capital and the post-closing cash adjustment payable to 
Gulfport under the terms of the Gulfport transaction. Upon repayment of the 
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, we will have 
$90.0 million of borrowing capacity under that facility to further fund our 
exploration and development activities and for general corporate purposes. 

All borrowings under our revolving credit facility are due and payable on 
October 15, 2014. As of September 30, 2012, $100.0 million was outstanding 
under our revolving credit facility and bore interest at a weighted average 
rate of 3.72% per annum. The amounts initially borrowed under our revolving 
credit facility were used to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness under 
our prior credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The Gulfport 
transaction note, which will be issued immediately prior to the effectiveness 
of the registration statement relating to this prospectus in connection with 
the Gulfport transaction, is due upon completion of this offering and does 
not bear interest unless it is not paid when due. 

All borrowings under our subordinated note are due and payable on January 31, 
2015 or the earlier completion of this offering. On May 14, 2012, we received 
an initial advance of $8.1 million under this note which provides for 
aggregate outstanding borrowings of up to $45.0 million. On September 30, 
2012, $30.0 million was outstanding under this note. The note bears interest 
at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.28% or 8% per annum, whichever is lower. Our 
borrowings under the subordinated note were used to fund our 2012 drilling

($1.213 billion if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional shares in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and the 
structuring fee, to purchase from LINN a number of LINN units equal to the 
number of shares sold in this offering. The per unit price we will pay for such
LINN units will be equal to the net proceeds we receive on a per share basis. 
LINN will pay our expenses incurred in connection with this offering. 

LINN intends to use the proceeds it receives from the sale of LINN units to 
repay debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility and pay estimated 
expenses of this offering.

In July 2012, LINN entered into an amendment to its revolving credit facility 
to increase the maximum commitment amount from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. As
of August 31, 2012, LINN had approximately $2.0 billion of indebtedness 
outstanding under its revolving credit facility, with a weighted average 
interest rate of 2.24%. The revolving credit facility matures in April 2017, 
and, at LINN’s election, borrowings bear interest at either the London 
Interbank Offered Rate, plus an applicable margin between 1.5% and 2.5% per 
annum (depending on the then-current level of borrowings under the revolving 
credit facility), or at a base rate, plus an applicable margin between 0.5% and
1.5% per annum (depending on the then-current level of borrowings under the 
revolving credit facility). Borrowings made under LINN’s revolving credit 
facility within the past twelve months were used primarily to finance LINN’s 
acquisition strategy.

stock in this offering will be approximately $68.3 million after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
payable by us. If the option to purchase additional shares is exercised in 
full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $78.7 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and 
to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to 
use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

 •  approximately $17.0 million to fund the continued clinical development 
    and other studies and work needed for the anticipated FDA and EMA filings 
    for OCA as a treatment for PBC, as detailed below; 
 
 •  approximately $19.0 million to fund the continuation of the long-term 
    safety extension portion of our POISE clinical trial and the Phase 3 
    clinical outcomes trial after the anticipated FDA and EMA filings;  
 •  approximately $10.0 million to fund certain pre-commercialization 
    activities of OCA for PBC;

 •  approximately $4.0 million to fund further preclinical development work 
    on INT-767 and, if warranted, Phase 1 clinical trials of INT-767; 
 
 •  approximately $5.0 million to fund the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical 
    trial for an additional indication for OCA, such as portal hypertension, 
    if warranted; and  

 •  the remainder for general corporate purposes, general and administrative 
    expenses, capital expenditures, working capital and prosecution and 
    maintenance of our intellectual property.

We believe that the remaining clinical development and other studies and 
work needed for anticipated FDA and EMA filings for the approval of OCA 
as a treatment for PBC will require approximately $40.0 million. We believe 
that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including $29.8 million of net 
proceeds received on August 9, 2012 upon the issuance of our Series 
C preferred stock, along with the net proceeds from this offering, together 
with interest on cash balances, will be sufficient to fund our operating 
expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2016 and fund the 
continued development of OCA through the following events:

 •  the completion of our Phase 3 POISE trial;  

 •  initiation of the long-term safety extension portion of the POISE trial 
    and continuation of the ongoing long-term safety extension portion of 
    the Phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial;  

 •  initiation of a Phase 3 clinical outcomes trial to confirm clinical 
    benefit of OCA in PBC;  

 •  two-year animal carcinogenicity studies in both rats and mice;  

 •  a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers to evaluate the effect 
    of OCA on the heart’s electrical cycle, known as the QT interval, and 
    additional Phase 1 clinical trials;  

 •  manufacturing of clinical drug supply and materials necessary for the 
    anticipated FDA and EMA filings;  

 •  the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial for an additional indication
    for OCA, such as portal hypertension, if warranted; and  

 •  the work required for assimilation, preparation and submission of the 
    anticipated FDA and EMA filings.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the ongoing status and results of the POISE trial. 
Furthermore, we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding 
for the further development of OCA for other indications and for the 
development of our other product candidates.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the 
date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the 
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion 
of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses 
set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual use of net proceeds 
will vary depending on numerous factors, including our ability to obtain 
additional financing, the relative success and cost of our research, 
preclinical and clinical development programs, the amount and timing of 
additional revenues, if any, received from our collaborations with DSP and 
Servier and whether we are able to enter into future collaborations. As a 
result, management will have broad discretion in the application of the net 
proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the 
application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might 
decide to postpone or not pursue other clinical trials or preclinical 
activities if the net proceeds from this offering and the other sources 
of cash are less than expected. 

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering 
in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, 
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or 
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

in full, based on the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, and 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and 
financial flexibility, improve our visibility in the marketplace and create a 
public market for our common stock. We currently intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working 
capital and capital expenditures. We anticipate capital expenditures of 
approximately $3 million for the second half of 2012 relating to the 
acquisition of additional servers and network connectivity hardware and 
software and other costs associated with scaling our operations, technology and
infrastructure to support our growth. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to repay all or a portion of the 
term loan facility that we entered into on September 21, 2012 to fund our 
working capital needs following the final cash distribution to the members of 
Shutterstock Images LLC prior to our Reorganization. We have outstanding 
borrowings of $12.0 million under the term loan facility and expect to have 
outstanding borrowings of $12.0 million under the term loan facility as of the 
effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a 
part. The term loan facility provides for interest on the term loan, at our 
option, at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal minus 0.75%, 
or a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin of 2.00% and matures on the earlier of (i) 
September 21, 2013 and (ii) the date on which such facility is accelerated 
following the occurrence of an event of default. We selected the one-month 
LIBOR-based rate and can select a new interest rate option after the month 
expires. 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in 
complementary companies, products or technologies, although we currently do not
have any acquisitions or investments planned. Based on our historical cash from
operations, as well as borrowings under our term loan facility, we do not 
expect that we will have to utilize any of the net proceeds to us from this 
offering to fund our operations during the next 12 months. Therefore, we will 
have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds received in this 
offering. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this 
offering in interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

stock in this offering will be approximately $1,023 million (or $1,177 million 
if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares 
of common stock from us), after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions and offering expenses. 

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive in this offering, along with 
readily available cash, (i) to prepay all of the outstanding $650 million 
principal amount of the Second Lien Loans, (ii) to repurchase or redeem 
approximately $64 million principal amount of outstanding 10.50% Senior Notes 
and $41 million principal amount of outstanding Senior Toggle Notes, (iii) to 
redeem approximately $207 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible 
Notes that are not held by the Significant Holders following the closing date of 
this offering at a redemption price equal to 90% of the principal amount 
thereof, or $186 million, (iv) to pay the $15 million cash portion of the 
Management Agreement Termination Fee which will be paid on January 15, 2013, (v) 
to pay the cash payment of approximately $105 million pursuant to the 
Significant Holder letter agreements (a portion of which will be attributable to 
accrued interest on the Convertible Notes), (vi) to pay the prepayment premiums 
and fees in connection with the repayment of the foregoing indebtedness and 
(vii) to pay interest of approximately $59 million, representing interest 
payable from April 15, 2012 through the anticipated prepayment date of the 
indebtedness that will be repaid. The Significant Holders will not receive the 
interest payment to be paid on the Convertible Notes on October 15, 2012. The 
amount of the cash payment to be paid to the Significant Holders is equal to the 
accrued and unpaid interest that the Significant Holders would have otherwise 
been entitled to receive with respect to the Convertible Notes held by them if 
they held such Convertible Notes through October 15, 2012, the next regularly 
scheduled interest payment date for the Convertible Notes. We expect that the 
prepayment of the Second Lien Loans and our issuance of redemption notices to 
holders of the 10.50% Senior Notes and the Senior Toggle Notes (which will 
specify that the redemption date will be on the 31st day following the date 
of such notice) will occur promptly following the closing of this offering. 
The prepayment, repurchase or redemption of the foregoing indebtedness will 
be in accordance with the respective agreements governing such indebtedness.

The Significant Holders have agreed to convert all of the Convertible Notes 
held by them into shares of common stock substantially concurrently with the 
closing of this offering. As of September 4, 2012, the Significant Holders 
held in the aggregate approximately $1.903 billion aggregate principal amount 
of Convertible Notes, which, once converted, will result in the issuance of 
an additional 82,131,954 shares of common stock promptly following the 
closing of this offering, including the shares of common stock issued 
pursuant to the Significant Holders letter agreements. We intend to issue a 
redemption notice to holders of approximately $207 million aggregate 
principal amount of Convertible Notes on the closing date of this offering, 
which will specify that the redemption date will be on the 31 st day following 
the date of such notice. 

To the extent that any Convertible Notes not owned by the Significant Holders 
are converted into common stock, the portion of the net proceeds of this 
offering that would have been used to pay the redemption price for such 
Convertible Notes would instead be applied to the repayment of our other 
indebtedness.

We expect delivery of the shares of common stock issued in this offering 
will be made against payment therefor with the underwriters of this offering 
on or about October 12, 2012, which is the second business day following the 
date hereof; however, we expect delivery of the shares of common stock issued 
in this offering will be made against payment therefor with purchasers in 
this offering on or about October 16, 2012, which is the fourth business day 
following the date hereof. 

The Second Lien Loans bear interest at a rate of 13.50% per year and mature 
on October 15, 2017. The 10.50% Senior Notes and the Senior Toggle Notes bear 
interest at rates of 10.50% and 11.00% per annum, respectively, and mature on 
April 15, 2014. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 11.00% per 
annum and mature on April 15, 2018.

certain affiliates of the underwriters hold a portion of the indebtedness being 
repaid with a portion of the proceeds of this offering as described above."

exercised their over-allotment option, we estimate that our net proceeds would 
be approximately $29.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions. 

The principal purposes for this offering are to increase our working capital, 
create a public market for our ordinary shares, facilitate our access to the 
public capital markets and increase our visibility in our markets. 

We intend to use our proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. In addition, we 
also may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses,
products or technologies. However, we are not currently contemplating any such 
acquisitions. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares by the 
selling shareholders. 

As of the date of this prospectus, however, we have not determined all of the 
anticipated uses for the proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we will 
actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amount and timing of actual 
expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, 
including the amount of cash generated from our operations, competitive and 
technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. 
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in applying the 
net proceeds of this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds as described 
above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us 
(including the consulting fee being paid to our consultant as described 
in ""Underwriting"") will be approximately $80 million (or approximately $92 
million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full). 

We intend to use $77 million of net proceeds to fund the purchase by Amira 
Mauritius of equity shares of Amira India pursuant to the share subscription 
agreement, which will occur contemporaneously with the completion of this 
offering, and to retain $3 million to fund future operating expenses of 
ANFI through 2015. 

Net proceeds of $77 million to be received by Amira India pursuant to the 
share subscription agreement are intended to be used as follows: 

• $25 million to partially fund the development of a new processing facility; 
and 

• $52 million to repay our term loan facilities and a portion of the 
indebtedness under our secured revolving credit facilities. 
  
Upon repayment of our term loan facilities and secured revolving credit 
facilities, we do not plan to immediately draw down on our credit 
facilities. 

The weighted average interest rates under our term loan facilities and 
outstanding secured revolving credit facilities for each of the years 
ended March 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and the three months ended June 30,

Our outstanding secured revolving credit facilities mature within one year. 
In the past year, we have used our revolving credit under such facilities to 
purchase paddy and other raw materials. Our term loan facilities have been 
utilized to finance the installation of plant and machinery at our processing 
facility. As of June 30, 2012, an aggregate of $109.2 million of debt under 
such facilities was outstanding. 

Other than the amounts to be used to partially fund the development of a new 
processing facility and repay our term loan facilities and outstanding 
secured revolving credit facilities, we have not yet determined the exact 
amount of the net proceeds to be used specifically for any of the foregoing 
purposes. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in 
applying the remaining net proceeds from this offering. We may find it 
necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering 
for other purposes. Pending their use, we intend to invest our net proceeds 
from this offering primarily in short term, investment grade,

offering, we are selling an aggregate of 250,000 shares of common stock at 
$20.00 per share in a private placement to an entity controlled by Messrs.

by SBBC and we will not reimburse SBBC for these costs. 

We plan to use all the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent

objectives and strategies described in this prospectus. Our focus will be on 
purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency mortgage-backed 
securities and other mortgage-related investments, subject to our investment 
guidelines and REIT qualification requirements. ARRM will make determinations 
as to the percentage of our target assets that will be invested in each of our 
target assets. These decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions and 
may change over time in response to opportunities available in different 
interest rate, economic and credit environments. Until appropriate assets can 
be identified, the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placement may be invested in interest-bearing short-term investments, including
funds that are consistent with our qualification as a REIT. These investments 
are expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from 
our target assets. We anticipate that we will be able to identify a sufficient 
amount of investments in agency mortgage-backed securities and non-agency 
mortgage-backed securities within approximately one to three months after the 
closing of the offering and the concurrent private placement. However, 
depending on the availability of appropriate investment opportunities and 
subject to prevailing market conditions, there can be no assurance that we 
will be able to identify a sufficient amount of investments within this 
timeframe."

     •   approximately US$15.0 million to expand our product development and       
         services offerings, including through the hiring of additional research   
         and development personnel and the further development of Mobile YY;       

     •   approximately US$15.0 million to expand our sales and marketing           
         activities, including the hiring of additional sales and marketing        
         personnel; and

         licensing opportunities.                                                  

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our
business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in
applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws
and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions, and only if we satisfy the applicable government
registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to meet these requirements on a timely basis, if at all.

"ALON USA PARTNERS, LP",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/alon-usa-partners-lp-888763-70662,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/alon-usa-partners-lp-888763-70662,424B4,11/21/2012,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=8931871,"We will receive net proceeds of approximately $146.8 million from the sale of
10,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to repay approximately
$146.8 million of principal and accrued interest relating to intercompany debt
payable by our subsidiaries to Alon Energy and its affiliates.

As of September 30, 2012, we had approximately $346.6 million in intercompany
debt payable to Alon Energy and certain of its subsidiaries with a January 2018
maturity and a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 8.0%. It is
expected that an additional $51.5 million of intercompany debt payable, which
has currently been eliminated in the Alon USA Partners, LP Predecessor combined
financial statements, will be transferred to Alon Energy or one of its
subsidiaries prior to closing. The transfer will cause the intercompany debt
payable to Alon Energy to increase from $346.6 million at September 30, 2012, to
approximately $398.1 million. This intercompany debt was incurred to satisfy
working capital requirements, fund acquisitions and for general corporate
purposes. We expect that the remaining balance of the intercompany debt will be
eliminated prior to closing or in connection with the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional common units, and we do not expect that we will incur any
significant additional intercompany debt following the closing of this offering.
In addition, we expect to have approximately $84.0 million and $250 million
outstanding under our amended and restated revolving credit facility and new
term loan facility following the closing of this offering, respectively. We do
not currently expect to draw significant amounts under our amended and restated
revolving credit facility following the closing of this offering other than in
the ordinary course to fund capital expenditures and our working capital needs.

The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional common units (approximately $22.3 million, if exercised in full) will
be distributed to Alon Energy as repayment of intercompany debt and in whole or
in part as reimbursement for certain pre-formation capital expenditures. If the
underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional common units,
we will issue 1,500,000 common units to Alon Energy at the expiration of the
option period as satisfaction of all remaining intercompany debt. If and to the
extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common
units, the number of units purchased by the underwriters pursuant to such
exercise will be issued to the public and the remainder, if any, will be issued
to Alon Energy as satisfaction of all remaining intercompany debt. Accordingly,
the exercise of the underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of
units outstanding or the amount of cash available to pay distributions on our
common units.

Certain of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the
future engage, in commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services
for us, Alon Energy and our respective affiliates from time to time in the
ordinary course of their business for which they have received customary fees
and reimbursement of expenses. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are
expected to be lenders under our new term loan facility. Certain of the
underwriters or their affiliates have performed or will perform commercial
banking, investment banking and advisory services for Alon Energy during the
180-day period prior to, or the 90-day period following, the date of this
prospectus, for which they have received or will receive customary fees and
reimbursement or expenses."

approximately $94.4 million, based upon the initial public offering price of 
$15.00 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional shares from the selling 
stockholders in this offering, there will be no change in the total proceeds to
us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the 
selling stockholders, although we will bear the costs, other than underwriting 
discounts and commissions, associated with those sales. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
common stock and thereby enable access to the public equity markets by our 
employees and stockholders, obtain additional capital and increase our 
visibility in the marketplace. As of the date of this prospectus we have no 
specific plans for the use of the net proceeds we receive from this offering. 
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and 
other general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities and 
products development. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the 
acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that 
complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements 
to enter into any acquisitions or investments. Pending these uses, we plan to 
invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing obligations, 
investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed 
obligations of the United States. The goal with respect to the investment of 
these net proceeds is capital preservation and liquidity so that such funds are
readily available to fund our operations. 

We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and 
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the 
application of the net proceeds of this offering."

offering will be $3,100,000, or $3,640,000 if the underwriters exercise their 
overallotment option in full, based on the initial public offering price of 
$5.00 per share, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions, underwriter non-accountable expense reimbursement fee, other 
underwriter expense reimbursement obligations and estimated offering expenses 
that we must pay. 

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the initial public offering price of $5.00 per 
share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by 
$720,000, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the 
cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working 
capital to fund anticipated operating expenses, establish a public market for 
our common stock and facilitate future access to the public capital markets. We
estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering for the following
purposes (set forth in order of use): 

 •  up to approximately $500,000 of these net proceeds to expand our cytology 
    and molecular diagnostics laboratory;  

 •  up to approximately $500,000 of these net proceeds to fund manufacture of 
    a number of MASCT System units needed to launch the MASCT System across the
    United States as our initial national roll-out of the product;  

 •  up to approximately $1,500,000 of these net proceeds to hire and train 
    sales and marketing personnel for initial regional marketing and subsequent
    national distribution;  

 •  up to approximately $1,000,000 of these net proceeds to develop and 
    commence manufacturing and commercialization of the FullCYTE Test;  

 •  up to approximately $1,000,000 of these net proceeds to develop and 
    commercialize the NextCYTE Test; and  

 •  the remaining net proceeds for the research and development of Intraductal 
    Treatment Programs, our diagnostic tools and for general working capital 
    purposes, including approximately $50,000 for patent maintenance fees and 
    application prosecution expenses related to the Acueity asset purchase.  

A portion of the net proceeds may be used to acquire or invest in complementary
businesses, technologies, services or products in the event that we identify 
opportunities for such acquisitions, or investments that we believe are in the 
best interests of our stockholders. We have no current plans, agreements or 
commitments with respect to any such acquisition or investment, and we are not 
currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to any such transaction. 

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds as described
above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of funds may be 
necessary. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon 
numerous factors, including the progress of our development and 
commercialization efforts, the development of our business opportunities and 
our operating costs and expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have 
significant flexibility in applying these net proceeds. An investor will not 
have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other information 
on which we base our decisions on how to use the proceeds. 

The costs and timing of commercialization of our products and development of 
business opportunities are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial risks 
and can often change. Accordingly, we may change the allocation of use of these
proceeds as a result of contingencies such as the uptake of our products in the
marketplace, competitive responses, and operating costs and expenditures. 

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering as described above or otherwise,
we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade securities."

discounts, the structuring fee and offering expenses, to be approximately 
$152.7 million. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering: 

. to fund an approximately $53.1 million cash distribution to Delek; 

. to retire the approximately $63.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under 
  our predecessor’s revolving credit facility; 

. to provide $35.0 million in working capital to replenish certain amounts 
  distributed by us to Delek, in the form of trade and other accounts 
  receivable, in connection with the closing of this offering; and 

. for other general partnership purposes. 


As of October 31, 2012, $63.0 million was outstanding under our predecessor’s 
revolving credit facility, with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.0%. 
Immediately prior to the closing of this offering, we expect outstanding 
indebtedness under such revolving credit facility to be approximately $63.0 
million. Indebtedness under such credit facility matures on December 19, 2013.

At the closing of this offering, we will enter into a new $175 million 
revolving credit facility, which will replace our predecessor’s revolving 
credit facility. We will borrow $90 million under the new revolving credit 
facility to fund an additional $90 million cash distribution to Delek. The 
cash distributions to Delek from the proceeds of this offering will be made in 
consideration of its contribution of assets to us and in part for 
reimbursement of capital expenditures associated with our assets. We are 
funding these distributions through a combination of net proceeds from this 
offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility in order to 
optimize our capital structure. 

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the 
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the 
remainder of the 1,200,000 additional common units, if any, will be issued to 
Delek at the expiration of the option period. Any such units issued to Delek 
will be issued for no additional consideration from Delek. If the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional common units in full, the 
additional net proceeds would be approximately $23.4 million. The net proceeds 
from any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common 
units will be distributed to Delek. The issuance of the common units, 
subordinated units and general partner units, incentive distribution rights 
and the cash distributions to Delek and our general partner are being made in 
consideration of Delek’s contribution to us of our initial assets and 
operations and in part for reimbursement of capital expenditures associated 
with our assets."

We intend to use approximately $90.1 million of the net proceeds from the 
sale of common stock by us in this offering to repay a portion of the 
outstanding amounts under the Restoration Hardware, Inc. revolving line of 
credit and term loan and $7.0 million of the net proceeds to pay management 
fees to affiliates of Catterton, Tower Three and Glenhill pursuant to the 
terms of the management services agreement that will terminate upon 
consummation of this offering. In addition, we intend to use $8.4 million 
of available cash to further reduce amounts outstanding under Restoration 
Hardware, Inc.’s revolving line of credit and term loan. 

The total outstanding amounts under the Restoration Hardware, Inc. 
revolving line of credit was $129.6 million as of July 28, 2012. The maturity 
date of the revolving line of credit is August 3, 2016. Borrowings under 
the revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate equal to either the 
bank’s reference rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate as published by 
Reuters, referred to as “LIBOR,” plus an applicable margin rate. 

The total outstanding amounts under the Restoration Hardware, Inc. term loan 
was $14.8 million, net of $0.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, 
as of July 28, 2012. The term loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 
5.0%. Restoration Hardware, Inc. is required to make quarterly payments of 
$1.25 million beginning October 2012 with the final payment in April 2015. 

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing 
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or 
guaranteed obligations of the United States government.

"SOUTHCROSS ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/southcross-energy-partners-lp-880060-69696,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/southcross-energy-partners-lp-880060-69696,424B4,11/2/2012,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=8892255,"We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $168.7 million, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, from the issuance and 
sale of common units offered by this prospectus. We will use the net proceeds 
from this offering to: 

• make a cash distribution to Holdings of $38.5 million, a portion of which 
will be used to reimburse Holdings for certain capital expenditures it 
incurred with respect to assets contributed to us; 

• repay $125.0 million of debt outstanding under our existing credit 
facility; 

• pay Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC an 
aggregate structuring fee of $0.7 million; and 

• pay estimated offering expenses of $4.5 million. 

Holdings may use a portion of the cash distribution it receives from us to 
redeem all or a portion of Holdings' outstanding redeemable preferred units. 

Immediately following the repayment of a portion of the outstanding balance 
under our existing credit facility with the net proceeds of this offering, 
we will terminate our existing credit facility, enter into a new credit 
facility and borrow approximately $150.0 million under that credit facility. 
We will use the proceeds from these borrowings to (i) make an ordinary course 
cash distribution of approximately $7.5 million to Holdings, (ii) repay the 
remaining balance of $140.0 million outstanding under our existing credit 
facility and (iii) pay fees and expenses of approximately $2.5 million 
relating to our new credit facility. 

As of September 30, 2012, we had approximately $253.2 million of indebtedness 
outstanding under our existing credit facility with a weighted average 
interest rate of 4.5%. The revolving credit facility matures on June 10,
2016, and borrowings bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the 
lesser of LIBOR, plus the applicable margins ranging from 2.25% to 4.25%, or 
at a base rate, plus applicable margins ranging from 1.25% to 3.25%. 
Borrowings made under our credit facility within the last twelve months were 
used primarily to fund capital expenditures. 

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units, 
we will use the net proceeds from that exercise to redeem from Holdings a 
number of common units equal to the number of common units issued upon such 
exercise, at a price per common unit equal to the proceeds per common unit 
in this offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts, 
commissions and structuring fees. 

The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and 
perform services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business. 
Affiliates of the underwriters are lenders under our existing credit facility 
and will, in that respect, receive a portion of the proceeds from this 
offering through the repayment of borrowings outstanding under our credit 
facility."

(1) The underwriters will receive an underwriting discount equal to 1.8% of the 
    gross proceeds from the sale of units in the firm commitment offering, and  
    1.75% of the gross proceeds from the sale of units pursuant to an exercise  
    of the over-allotment option.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the sale of the    
    placement warrants. Excludes the payment of $100 from the underwriters for  
    the unit purchase option, $2,720 from the underwriters for the underwriter  
    shares, and the proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.             

(3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.              

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at
    $555,000 in the event the over allotment options is exercised. We estimate  
    that the amount of interest we will earn on the trust account will be       
    negligible (between $6,500 for 18 months and $8,000 for 21 months at current
    interest rates), and will therefore not be a significant source of working  
    capital for us. For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to  
    us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us.            

(5) The amount available to us for expenses and working capital will be the same
    regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised. In the event  
    that our operating expenses exceed the working capital available to us from 
    net proceeds not held in trust account and interest earned on monies held in
    the trust account (any amounts in the trust account in excess of $10.40 per 
    share, or approximately $10.35 per share in the event the over-allotment    
    option is exercised in full), our founders may fund any working capital     
    requirements through loans to be paid back upon the consummation of an      
    acquisition transaction.

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our founders and their
designees have committed to purchase the placement warrants from us for an
aggregate purchase price of $3,375,000. These purchases will take place on a
private placement basis immediately prior to the consummation of this offering.
We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the
placement warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be
placed in the trust account described below.

A total of approximately $41,600,000 (or approximately $45,137,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the placement warrants described in this
prospectus will be placed in a trust account at J.P. Morgan with American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company as trustee. We expect that the trust assets will be
held in an account located outside of the United States. Net proceeds of this
offering in the amount of $555,000 will not be held in the trust account. We
believe the proceeds of this offering initially available to us outside of the
trust account, together with the interest income on the balance of the trust
account (any amounts in the trust account in excess of $10.40 per share, or
approximately $10.35 per share in the event the over-allotment option is
exercised in full) to be released to us from time to time for working capital
requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 21
months, assuming an acquisition transaction is not completed during that time.
The per unit amount in trust will be greater than approximately $10.35 in the
event the underwriters do not exercise the over-allotment option in full because
the underwriter’s discount is based on a percentage of the aggregate offering
price, while other offering costs and the proceeds from the sale of the
placement warrants are fixed regardless of whether the over-allotment option is
exercised.

Except for any amounts paid to redeeming shareholders in connection with our
initial acquisition transaction, the proceeds held in the trust account will not
be released from the trust account until (i) the consolidation of each class of
our ordinary shares into one class of ordinary shares after consummation of an
acquisition transaction or a post-acquisition tender offer, (ii) our liquidation
of the trust account in the event we do not consummate an acquisition
transaction prior to 18 months (or 21 months pursuant to the automatic period
extension) following the consummation of this offering or (iii) our liquidation
of the trust account in the event we do not commence a post-acquisition tender
offer within 30 days of consummation of the acquisition transaction or
consummate the post-acquisition tender offer within the earlier of 6 months of
consummating the acquisition transaction or 21 months of consummation of this
offering. All amounts held in the trust account that are not:

• distributed to shareholders who exercise redemption rights;

• released to us for working capital purposes and general corporate          
  requirements (any amount in the trust account in excess of $10.40 per      
  public share, or approximately $10.35 per share in the event the           
  over-allotment option is exercised in full);                               

• released to us to pay taxes; or

• a pro rata share of the trust account that may be released to us for each  
  callable Class A Share (excluding the founders’ shares) converted to a     
  Class C Share upon completion of an acquisition transaction; 

will be released to us upon the consolidation of each class of ordinary shares
into one class of ordinary shares after consummation of an initial acquisition
transaction or, post-acquisition tender offer, as the case may be.

The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete an acquisition transaction.
Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may
be used to finance operations of the target business.

Our initial acquisition transaction must be with one or more target businesses
whose fair market value, individually or collectively, is equal to at least 80%
of the balance held in our trust account (excluding taxes payable) at the time
of such acquisition. The fair market value of the target will be determined by
our board of directors based upon an analysis conducted by them (which may
include an analysis of actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or
book value). We anticipate structuring an acquisition transaction to acquire
100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business. We may, however,
structure an acquisition transaction to acquire less than 100% of such interests
or assets of the target business, but we will not acquire less than a
controlling interest and will in all instances be the controlling shareholder of
the target company. The key factors that we will rely on in determining
controlling shareholder status would be our acquisition of more than 50% of the
voting rights of the target company and control of the majority of any governing
body of the target company. Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of
Association require that we acquire a controlling interest in a target business
in connection with an acquisition transaction. We will not consider any
transaction that does not meet such criteria.

Upon release of funds from the trust account, and after payment of the
redemption price to any shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, the
remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion
of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial
acquisition transaction occurs. If the initial acquisition transaction is paid
for using equity or debt securities or additional funds from a private offering
of debt or equity securities or borrowings, we may apply the cash released to us
from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance
or expansion of operations of the acquired business or businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our
initial acquisition transaction, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for
working capital.

Intercarbo Holding AG, an entity controlled by one of our founders, Taras
Vazhnov, has loaned us a total of $402,155, which amount was used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above
related to the SEC registration fee, the FINRA filing fee and a portion of the
legal and audit fees and expenses. Of this amount, $180,155 is due promptly
after the consummation of this offering, $52,000 is due on the earlier of April
30, 2013 or the date of consummation of this offering, and $170,000 is due on
the earlier of July 16, 2013 or the date of consummation of this offering. These
loans do not bear any interest. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not placed in the trust account.

We have agreed to pay to CIS Acquisition Holding Co. Ltd. a total of $7,500 per
month for office space, administrative services and secretarial support for a
period commencing on the date of this prospectus and ending on the earlier of
our consummation of an acquisition transaction or our liquidation. Payment of
such fees shall begin to accrue immediately after this offering and shall be
paid at the time of an acquisition transaction, or in the event of our
liquidation, only out of interest earned on the trust account or assets not held
in trust, if any. CIS Acquisition Holding Co. Ltd. is an affiliate of Anatoly
Danilitskiy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Taras Vazhnov, our
director. This arrangement was agreed to by our Board of Directors for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Messrs. Danilitskiy or Vazhnov
compensation in lieu of a management fee or other remuneration because it is
anticipated that the expenses to be paid by CIS Acquisition Holding Co. Ltd.
will approximate the amount of accrued reimbursement. Upon consummation of an
acquisition transaction or our liquidation, we will cease to accrue these
monthly fees.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income
that may be released to us (all amounts in the trust account in excess of $10.40
per public share, or approximately $10.35 per share in the event the 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) and will be sufficient to
pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated for up to 21
months. Our estimates are based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be
undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other
preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an acquisition transaction.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating an acquisition transaction is lower than the actual amount necessary
to do so, or in the event the amounts not held in the trust account is
insufficient to pay our costs and expenses, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable, through loans or additional investments from our founders or
our officers and directors. None of our founders, officers or directors is under
any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

The net proceeds from this offering and the private placement of the placement
warrants that are not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will
be invested only in U.S. “government securities” (as such term is defined in the
Investment Company Act) and/or one or more money market funds, selected by us,
which invest principally in either short-term securities issued or guaranteed by
the United States having a rating in the highest investment category granted
thereby by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or
short-term municipal bonds issued by governmental entities located within the
United States, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act.

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, we will not pay fees of any kind (including finder’s and
consulting fees) to any of our officers, or directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the acquisition transaction. However, our officers and directors
and their respective affiliates will receive reimbursement for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with identifying,
investigating and consummating a potential acquisition transaction with one or
more target businesses. There are no limitations on the amount of expenses for
which they can seek reimbursement, provided such expenses were incurred for our
benefit. We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
monitored or performed by Anatoly Danilitskiy, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman, and Kyle Shostak, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and a
director. In addition to our management team, our special advisor, Alexey
Chuykin, and our regional mergers and acquisitions consultant, Alex Lyamport,
will advise and assist us from time to time in identifying a target business and
consummating an acquisition transaction. Additionally, we may engage market
research firms and/or third-party consultants. Our board of directors will have
the responsibility of reviewing and approving all expense reimbursements made to
our founders, officers or directors, and their respective affiliates, with any
interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. To
the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless
we consummate an acquisition transaction. These expenses would be a liability of
the post-combination business and would be treated in a manner similar to any
other account payable of the combined business. Our officers and directors may,
as part of any such acquisition transaction, negotiate the repayment of some or
all of any such expenses. If the target business’ owners do not agree to such
repayment, this could cause our directors to view such potential acquisition
transaction unfavorably and result in a conflict of interest. Although we
currently expect that the members of our management team will become a part of
the management team of the combined entity, since the actual role of each
present member of management after an acquisition transaction is uncertain, we
have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to
those persons after an acquisition transaction.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only (i) upon our automatic voluntary trust account liquidation if we fail to
consummate our initial acquisition transaction within the allotted time, (ii)
upon our liquidation of our trust account if we fail to commence or complete our
post-acquisition tender offer within the allotted time, or (iii) if the public
shareholder seeks to have us redeem their shares for cash in connection with an
acquisition transaction that was actually consummated. In no other circumstances

(1)    Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
       shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business           
       combination.                                                                 

(2)    In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been prepaid from the   
       proceeds of $205,000 of a loan from our sponsor and an affiliate of our      
       sponsor, as described in this prospectus. In the event that offering expenses
       are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for     
       post-closing working capital expenses.                                       

(3)    The underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $2.34 million of their   
       underwriting commissions (or approximately $2.7 million if the underwriters’ 
       overallotment option is exercised in full), which equals 3.125% of the gross 
       proceeds from the units offered to the public, until consummation of initial 
       business combination. Upon consummation of our initial business combination, 
       approximately $2.34 million, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred    
       commissions (or approximately $2.7 million if the underwriters’ overallotment
       option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds 
       held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and
       can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
       businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general 
       corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on            
       indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to
       fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital.                

(4)    All of the proceeds of the private placement and a portion of the net        
       proceeds of the offering (being $71,250,000 of the net proceeds from this    
       offering, including deferred underwriting commissions of approximately $2.34 
       million (or $82,190,625 of the net proceeds from this offering, including    
       deferred underwriting commissions of approximately $2.7 million, if the      
       underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full)), will be placed in 
       a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. located in the United States,
       maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. 

(5)    These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
       these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we  
       may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
       connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon
       the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we        
       identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific    
       regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due      
       diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our      
       staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of           
       consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not      
       anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
       fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
       fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
       category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount of 
       interest available to us from the trust account may be less than expected as 
       a result of the current interest rate environment. Based on the current      
       interest rate environment, we would expect approximately $100,000 (after     
       payment of taxes owed on such interest income) to be available to us from    
       interest earned on the funds held in the trust account; however, we can      
       provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an        
       interest rate of 0.17% per annum based upon current yields of securities in  
       which the trust account may be invested.                                     

(6)    Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
       initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision (a provision      
       designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions   
       with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) and  
       commitment fees for financing.                                               

A total of approximately $75.0 million (or approximately $85.9 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the aggregate net
proceeds from this offering and all of the private placement, including
approximately $2.34 million (or approximately $2.7 million if the underwriters’
overallotment option is exercised in full) of the deferred underwriting
discount, will be placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in United States
government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds investing solely in United States Treasuries and meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for any 
interest income released to us for working capital purposes or the payment of 
taxes or dissolution expenses, none of the funds held in the trust account will
be released, subject to the requirements of law, until the earlier of (i) the 
consummation of our initial business combination; (ii) the expiration or 
termination of any tender offer conducted by us in connection with a proposed 
business combination not otherwise withdrawn; (iii) the redemption of our 
public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 
21 months from the date of this prospectus, subject to applicable law; or (iv) 
otherwise upon our liquidation or in the event our board of directors resolves 
to liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a 
business combination prior to the expiration of the 21 month period (our board 
of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such 
expiration if it determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable 
within the remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or 
satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a 
business combination).

We may increase the initial amount held in the trust account from approximately
$10.00 per public share prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement
of which this prospectus forms a part. In such case, we expect that the increase
would be funded by an increase in the amount of the deferral by the underwriters
of the underwriting discount payable in connection with this offering, an
increase in the number of placement units to be purchased by our sponsor, Joseph
Wright or Cowen Overseas at $10.00 per unit and/or a reduction from $925,000 of
the amount initially available to us for working capital that is not held in the
trust account. Public stockholders would own a smaller percentage of our
outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis to the extent that our
sponsor, Joseph Wright or Cowen Overseas purchases additional placement units.
We do not intend to reduce the initial amount to be held in the trust account.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination, we
may apply the cash released from the trust account that is not applied to the
purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust plus interest income on the amount in
the trust account that may be released to fund working capital requirements will
be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are
allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary
due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest,
we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of
the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a
letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a
business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking
in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us. To the extent that the underwriters exercise their
overallotment option, the interest income we may withdraw from the trust account
will proportionately increase. In addition, if the size of this offering is
increased or decreased, it would result in a proportionate increase or decrease
in the amount of interest earned in the trust account. We will use any such
increase in interest income to cover our working capital expenses. While we
currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and while
they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, we
believe that any additional interest income earned and released to us would
facilitate our ability finance the exploration and consideration of a greater
number of potential acquisition targets.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq, we have
agreed to pay The Chart Group L.P., an affiliate of our sponsor, a total of
$10,000 per month for office space, administrative services and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by The Chart Group L.P. for our
benefit and is not intended to provide The Chart Group L.P. compensation in 
lieu of salary or other remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon 
consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will 
cease paying these monthly fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor and an affiliate of our sponsor
have loaned to us a total of $205,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses
of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at
the earlier of December 31, 2012 or the closing of this offering. The loan will
be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the proceeds of this
offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital
held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from
our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $750,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holders
(except that the placement warrants issued to Cowen Overseas, so long as held by
Cowen Overseas or any of its related persons under FINRA rules, will expire five
years from the effective date of the registration statement of which this
prospectus forms a part, or earlier upon our liquidation). The terms of such
loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no
written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, we may enter into privately negotiated transactions to
purchase public shares from stockholders following consummation of the initial
business combination with proceeds released to us from the trust account
immediately following consummation of the initial business combination. Our
initial stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates may also purchase
shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the
consummation of our initial business combination. Neither we nor our initial
stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will make any
such purchases when we or they are in possession of any material non-public
information not disclosed to the seller. Although we do not currently anticipate
paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, in the event we do,
the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of those stockholders
not receiving any such additional consideration. In addition, the payment of a
premium by us after the consummation of our initial business combination may not
be in the best interest of the remaining stockholders who do not redeem their
shares. Such stockholders will experience a reduction in book value per share
compared to the value received by stockholders that have their shares purchased
by us at a premium. Except for the limitations described above on use of trust
proceeds released to us prior to consummating our initial business combination,
there is no limit on the number of shares that could be acquired by us or our
affiliates, or the price we or they may pay, if we hold a stockholder vote.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the expiration or termination of any tender offer conducted by
us in connection with a proposed business combination not otherwise withdrawn;
(iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a
business combination within 21 months from the date of this prospectus, subject
to applicable law; or (iv) otherwise upon our liquidation or in the event our
board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue
the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of the 21
month period (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust
account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment,

13,250,000 shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately
$228.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses of approximately $16.6 million (or, if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, approximately
$263.4 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and offering expenses of approximately $18.5 million).

We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to the Operating
Partnership, which will use the net proceeds of this offering to purchase
additional single-family properties, to renovate such properties for rental to
tenants and for working capital. In addition, we plan to make cash payments to
Prior Provident Investors in connection with the Formation Transactions of
approximately $5.3 million. Pending application of any portion of the net
proceeds, we or the Operating Partnership will invest such funds in
interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing securities as is
consistent with our intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT. These
investments are expected to provide lower net return than what we will seek to
achieve from our target assets."

discounts and commissions, associated with the sale of these shares. The selling
stockholders include certain of our executive officers. 

We will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds in this offering.
As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds from this offering. We currently intend to use the net
proceeds to us from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes,
including working capital, sales and marketing activities, general and
administrative matters and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of
the net proceeds to expand our current business through acquisitions or
investments in other complementary strategic businesses, products or
technologies. We have no commitments with respect to any acquisitions at this
time.

We intend to invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government, pending their use as
described above.

Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public
market for our common stock and increase our visibility in the marketplace. A
public market for our common stock will facilitate future access to public
equity markets and enhance our ability to use our common stock as a means of
attracting and retaining key employees and as consideration for acquisitions."
