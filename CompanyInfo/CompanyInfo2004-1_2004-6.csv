common stock in this offering will be approximately $124.9 million, or 
approximately $144.0 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full. This estimate is based upon the initial public offering price 
of $21.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. We will also receive $10 million from our 
private sale of common stock to Pfizer. 

      We intend to use these net proceeds approximately as follows: 

   
   •   25% to fund our research and development activities;  
   
   •   30% to build our sales and marketing capabilities; and  
   
   •   45% for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, 
facilities expansion and potential acquisitions as described below.  


      Our potential use of net proceeds for acquisitions may include the 
acquisition or licensing of rights to potential new drugs, drug targets or drug 
delivery technologies. Although we periodically evaluate acquisition and 
licensing opportunities, we currently have no commitments or agreements with 
respect to any specific acquisition or license. 

      Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of 
this offering in short- to medium-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
securities."

from the sale by us of 2,250,000 ordinary shares in this offering, after 
deducting the underwriting discount and the estimated offering expenses. We 
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares by the selling 
shareholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate 
purposes, including: 

 •  to open sales and marketing offices in additional markets;  
 •  to expand our product and service offerings;  
 •  to increase our sales and marketing capabilities in our existing markets;  
 •  to penetrate new market segments; and  
 •  for working capital to support the growth of our business.  

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds for acquisitions of additional 
businesses and technologies or the establishment of joint ventures. We do not 
have any specific plans or commitments for any acquisitions or joint ventures 
at the present time. We cannot be certain that we will complete any acquisition 
or joint venture or, that if completed, any acquisition or joint venture will 
be successful. We have not allocated any specific amounts of the net proceeds 
for any of the purposes indicated above. 

Until we use the net proceeds of the offering, we will invest the funds 
primarily in short-term interest-bearing investments with interest and 
principal linked to the dollar, hedged to the dollar or linked to the Israeli 
consumer price index. We may also deposit the funds in dollar-linked or 
dollar-hedged bank accounts in Israel, Europe, the U.S. and Asia."

expect net proceeds from this offering of approximately $216.8 million and 
approximately $241.0 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised 
in full. 

       We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to our operating 
partnership in exchange for series A preferred units, the economic terms of 
which will be substantially similar to the series A preferred stock. Our 
operating partnership will subsequently use the net proceeds received from us 
to potentially acquire or develop additional properties and for general 
corporate purposes. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in 
full, we expect to use the additional net proceeds in the same manner. 

       Pending application of cash proceeds, we will invest the net proceeds in 
interest bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing securities which are 
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax

underwriting discounts and commissions, financial advisory fees and offering 
expenses payable by us. The net proceeds may vary because total expenses 
relating to the offering may be more or less than our estimates. 

       We are undertaking the offering to have the capital resources available 
to expand and diversify our business. The offering proceeds will increase our 
capital, permit us to reduce our outstanding indebtedness (which at September 30, 
2003 totaled $8.8 million) and provide funds for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes. We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds to 
repay approximately $7.5 million of indebtedness with maturity dates and

      We may use the net proceeds for capital expenditures to expand our 
operations and for strategic acquisitions of businesses, products or

definite acquisition or expansion plans, although we intend to actively pursue 
such opportunities. Pending such uses, the net proceeds may be invested in

with this offering, including all expenses of the selling stockholders which we 
have agreed to pay. 

        If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we

the sale of 3,625,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting 
underwriting discounts but before paying estimated offering expenses. 

        We intend to use the net proceeds of $79.5 million from this offering 
to: 

• repay $50.0 million in term loans, including $8.3 million of prepayment fees 
(which will also satisfy $4.0 million of accrued supplemental interest); 


• repay $4.5 million in subordinated debt; 


• repay $14.3 million of debt outstanding under our current revolving credit 
agreement; 


• pay $2.7 million to redeem 125,000 common units from K-Sea Transportation LLC 
at a price per common unit equal to the proceeds per common unit before 
expenses but after underwriting discounts and commissions; 


• pay $2.4 million of expenses associated with the offering and the related 
transactions; and 


• pay structuring fees of $0.4 million to Lehman Brothers Inc. and UBS 
Securities LLC for advisory services in connection with the evaluation, 
analysis and structuring of the partnership. 

        The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general partnership 
purposes, including the planned capital expenditures. 

        As of September 30, 2003, we had $45.7 million in outstanding term 
loans, including $4.0 million of accrued supplemental interest, with a weighted 
average interest rate of 8.4% per year and a weighted average maturity of 
3.2 years. The term loans were incurred to finance acquisitions. As of 
September 30, 2003, we had approximately $14.3 million of indebtedness 
outstanding under our current revolving credit agreement, which was used to 
finance construction in progress. This debt bears interest at the 30-day London 
Interbank Offered Rate plus 2.95% and is due and payable in June 2004. 

        If the over-allotment option is exercised, we will use the net proceeds 
to redeem from K-Sea Transportation LLC a number of common units equal to the 
number of common units issued upon exercise of that option at a price per 
common unit equal to the proceeds per common unit before expenses but after 
underwriting discounts and commissions."

offering will be approximately $96.0 million, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We 
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the selling 
shareholders. 

        The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional 
capital, establish a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our 
future access to the public capital markets. We will use a portion of the net 
proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand and the net after-tax 
proceeds from the $75.0 million antitrust settlement that we received on 
December 31, 2003, to pay down, redeem or otherwise retire outstanding 
indebtedness. Our senior credit agreement currently requires that we use 50% of 
the net proceeds from this offering to pay down debt outstanding under our 
senior credit facility. Based upon our initial public offering price of 
$30.00 per share, we would estimate paying down $48.0 million under this 
facility and repurchasing at least $29.0 million of our 7 3 / 8 % Senior 
Subordinated Notes due 2013. However, we have obtained approval for an 
amendment to our senior credit agreement to be effective upon the closing of 
our initial public offering which will allow us to use the net proceeds of this 
offering at our discretion to repurchase our 7 3 / 8 % Senior Subordinated 
Notes due 2013 or pay down debt outstanding under our senior credit facility. 
We already have the right to repurchase such notes at a price equal to 107.375%, 
plus accrued but unpaid interest, pursuant to the optional redemption 
provisions of the indenture governing the notes. As such, we may repurchase an 
additional amount of our 7 3 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and pay 
down less of the balance outstanding under our senior credit facility. If we 
pay down additional amounts of our 7 3 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 
over the $29.0 million reflected in the pro forma consolidated financial 
statements, we will incur an additional 7 3 / 8 % premium for every dollar that 
we pay down. Our ability to optionally redeem our 7 3 / 8 % Senior Subordinated 
Notes due 2013 at the 7 3 / 8 % premium is limited under our indenture 
governing such notes and therefore, we may only repurchase up to $71.75 million. 
Other purchases must be done in the open market and we may incur additional 
premiums in open market purchases. In addition, we will pay approximately 
$18.7 million for bonuses to our named executive officers and other members of 
our management triggered by this offering plus estimated employer payroll taxes 
of approximately $300,000. Of the $18.7 million, the named executive officers 
will receive an aggregate of approximately $14.2 million and 74 other employees
will receive an aggregate of approximately $4.5 million. We will use any 
remaining net proceeds from the sale of the shares by us in the offering for 
general corporate purposes, including working capital, research and development, 
sales and marketing efforts and acquisitions and other strategic investments. 
We have no commitments with respect to any acquisitions or strategic 
investments. Pending their ultimate use, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
to us from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade 
securities. 

        The outstanding indebtedness that will be repaid, redeemed or otherwise 
retired with the proceeds to us in this offering was incurred in connection 
with our recapitalization that was consummated on August 11, 2003. We used the 
proceeds of this indebtedness, together with proceeds from (1) the issuance of 
Series A convertible preferred stock, (2) tax benefits arising from the 
recapitalization and (3) cash on hand to (a) redeem all of our then-outstanding 
9 5 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007, (b) repay then outstanding debt 
under our previously existing senior credit facility, (c) repurchase shares of 
our common stock and (d) pay transaction fees and expenses in connection with 
the recapitalization."

$40,308,000 from the sale of the shares of common stock in this offering, based 
on the initial public offering price of $7.50 per share and after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, our net 
proceeds will be approximately $46,586,000. We currently intend to use the net 
proceeds of this offering for the continued development of our clinical and 
preclinical stage programs and general corporate purposes. 

      Upon completion of this offering, we will make a one time cash payment to 
the University of California of $125,000, based on the initial public offering 
price of $7.50 per share. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not 
allocated any other proceeds for specific purposes. We may also use a portion
of the net proceeds of this offering to enter into strategic collaborations 
with third parties. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we 
expect to evaluate potential strategic collaborations. At this time, however, 
we do not have any present understandings, commitments or agreements with 
respect to any material strategic collaborations. 

      The amounts and timing of our actual use of proceeds will depend upon 
numerous factors, including the status of our product development and 
commercialization efforts, technological advances, the amount of proceeds 
actually raised in this offering and the amount of cash provided by any 
potential collaborations. As a result, we cannot specify with certainty the 
amounts that we may allocate to the particular uses of the net proceeds of this 
offering. Our management will have significant flexibility and discretion in 
applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending any use, we will invest the 
net proceeds of this offering generally in short-term, investment grade, 
interest bearing securities but cannot predict that these investments will 
yield a favorable return."

$17,850,000, or $20,527,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund maintained by 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The 
proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the 
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. 

The payment to CEA Group, LLC, one of our initial stockholders and an entity 
that is ultimately owned by J. Patrick Michaels, Jr., of a monthly fee of 
$7,500 is for general and administrative services including office space, 
utilities and secretarial support. We believe, based on rents and fees for 
similar services in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan area, that the fee charged 
by CEA Group is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an 
unaffiliated person. 

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $285,000) for 
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $60,000), with 
the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting 
and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed 
our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our 
behalf as described below. 

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as 
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust 
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the 
operations of the target business. 

CEA Group has advanced to us $60,000 which was used to pay a portion of the 
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC 
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loan 
will be payable without interest on the earlier of October 21, 2004 or the 
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the gross proceeds 
of this offering. 

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately 
required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in United States 
""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United 
States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less, so that we are 
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The 
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period 
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs 
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including 
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a 
business combination is not consummated during that time. 

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of 
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay CEA Group the fee described 
above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no compensation of 
any kind (including finders and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our 
existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us 
prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination. 
However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, 
such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on 
suitable business combinations. Since the role of present management after a 
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund 
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only 
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to 
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which 
the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no 
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any 
kind to or in the trust fund."

offering, or $101.0 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is

share. 

        We expect to use approximately $49.0 million of the net proceeds of 
this offering to complete our two Phase 3 clinical trials and post-approval 
trials for E2F Decoy for the prevention of vein graft failure. A majority of 
these expenses will be reimbursed by BMS pursuant to our collaboration 
agreement. We expect to use the balance of the net proceeds to continue the 
development of our product candidates and our research programs; to prepare for 
the commercial launch of E2F Decoy; and for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes. 

        The amounts we actually expend in these areas may vary significantly 
from our expectations and will depend on a number of factors, including 
operating costs and capital expenditures. Accordingly, management will retain 
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. You 
will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other 
information on which we base our decisions on how to use the proceeds. A 
portion of the net proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, services or products. We have no 
current plans, agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition 
or investment, and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations with 
respect to any such transaction. 

        We believe that the net proceeds of this offering, existing cash and 
cash equivalents, short-term investments, expected reimbursements of 
development costs of approximately $23.2 million in aggregate from BMS during 
fiscal 2004 and the first half of fiscal 2005 and the first regulatory 
milestone payment from BMS of $20.0 million (payable upon our first U.S. New 
Drug Application filing for E2F Decoy) will be sufficient to meet our capital 
requirements through at least mid-2005. Pending such uses, the net proceeds of 
this offering will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade securities."

(1)  On November 13, 2003 and January 8, 2004, we increased the outstanding 
amount of the preferred interest by an aggregate of $25,000, to $175,000.  
    
(2)    Consists of $478,500 cash purchase price for the Hometown communities, 
$23,000 cash purchase price for related community assets, $7,500 additional 
cash fee to Hometown and an estimated $8,090 in fees and transaction costs 
associated with the Hometown acquisition (including $2,800 in financial 
advisory fees payable to our lead underwriters).

(4)    Represents costs we expect to incur in organizing, registering and

Pending application of cash proceeds, we will invest such portion of the net 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing securities that are consistent with 
our election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such 
investments may include obligations of the Government National Mortgage 
Association, other government agency securities, certificates of deposit, 
interest-bearing bank deposits and mortgage loan participations. 

The mortgage and revolving indebtedness and the preferred interest to be repaid 
upon the completion of our concurrent offerings had a weighted average interest 
rate of approximately 7.47% and an average remaining term to maturity of 
approximately 2.7 years as of September 30, 2003. 

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment options for our concurrent 
offerings in full, we expect to use the additional net proceeds to our company, 
which will be approximately $83.1 million in the aggregate, for acquisitions 
and working capital needs, including funding the increase in the amount of our 
estimated initial distribution resulting from the issuance of additional shares 
of our common stock upon an exercise of the over-allotment option with respect

and approximately $492.6 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions, 
financial advisory fees and estimated expenses of our common stock offering, we 
will receive net proceeds from our common stock offering of approximately 
$385.2 million and approximately $450.2 million if the underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full. We do not take into account the 
proceeds to be received or expenses to be incurred by our selling stockholders 
in the information presented in this section. 

We will receive gross proceeds from our Series A preferred stock offering of 
$125.0 million and approximately $143.8 million if the underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full. After deducting the underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of our Series A preferred

offering of approximately $118.8 million and approximately $137.0 million if 
the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. 

We will contribute the net proceeds to our company from our concurrent offerings 
to our operating partnership. In addition, prior to or simultaneously with the 
consummation of our concurrent offerings we intend to complete the financing 
transactions pursuant to which: 

 •  subsidiaries of our operating partnership will incur $215.8 million in a 
new senior fixed rate mortgage loan due 2014;  
 •  subsidiaries of our operating partnership will incur $101.5 million in a 
new senior fixed rate mortgage loan due 2009; and  
 •  subsidiaries of our operating partnership will incur $182.7 million in a 
new senior variable rate mortgage loan due 2006.  

The following table sets forth the sources and uses of funds that we expect in 
connection with our concurrent offerings assuming that: 

 •  we complete the Hometown acquisition; and  
 •  we complete the financing transactions.  

We have based our amounts on balances outstanding at September 30, 2003 and 
actual sources and uses of funds may differ as a result of amortization of 
principal, additional loan exit fees, additional fees and expenses and 
differing loan restricted cash and reserve releases and other factors. 

This table identifies sources of funds arising from the financing transactions 
and our concurrent offerings with specific uses for the convenience of the 
reader; however, sources of funds from our concurrent offerings and the 
financing transactions may be commingled and have not been earmarked for 
particular purposes, and some of the uses indicated in the following table 
could be funded from other sources, such as our senior revolving credit 
facility.

common stock offered by us will be approximately $115,615,000, after deducting 
the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full, our net proceeds will be approximately $133,192,000. We 
currently intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay 
amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and equipment loan with 
a bank and the remainder for general corporate purposes, including working 
capital and capital expenditures. 

  

At December 31, 2003, our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit 
facility and equipment loan were approximately $4.0 million and $1.8 million, 
respectively. Our revolving credit facility expires in March 2005. Our 
equipment loan matures in July 2007. Our effective borrowing cost under our 
revolving credit facility and equipment loan at December 31, 2003 was 5.0% per 
annum. 

  

We have not yet determined all of our expected expenditures, and we cannot 
estimate the amounts to be used for each purpose set forth above. Accordingly, 
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds 
of this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend

stock offered by us will be approximately $20.8 million at an initial public 
offering price of $6.00 per share, after deducting the estimated underwriting 
discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of the 400,000 shares to be sold by the 
selling stockholders or the 660,000 shares to be sold by the selling 
stockholders pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. 

  

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to prepay the outstanding 
balances on our term loan with Union Bank of California, N.A., as required by 
our agreement with the bank. Our term loan with Union Bank accrues interest at 
a base rate equal to the bank rate that was 4% per annum for the period from 
May 30, 2003 through December 31, 2003. This term loan was obtained in May 2003 
and matures on May 31, 2005. Assuming we had repaid the term loan on December 31, 
2003, we would have been required to repay approximately $4.0 million to Union 
Bank, in addition to the $670,000 payment that we made on December 31, 2003. We 
also intend to use the net proceeds to redeem our outstanding mandatorily 
redeemable preferred stock, which our restated certificate of incorporation 
requires that we effect within ten days of the completion of this offering. We 
currently have 100,000 shares of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
outstanding. We will redeem these shares at a price of $103.35 per share, or an 
aggregate of $10,335,000, which amount includes all accrued dividends on such 
preferred stock and a redemption premium. We will use the remaining net 
proceeds of this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, 
including product research and development and capital expenditures. We may 
also use a portion of these net proceeds to fund possible investments in, or 
acquisitions of, complementary businesses, products or technologies. We 
currently have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such 
acquisition or investment, and we are not involved in any negotiations with 
respect to any similar transaction. Pending these uses, we will invest the net 
proceeds of the offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade 
securities. 

  

We will retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this 
offering. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures may vary

are selling in this offering will be approximately $8,838,500, or $10,240,250 
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based on the 
public offering price of $5.00 per unit, and after deducting the estimated 
underwriting discount of $840,000 and estimated offering expenses of $821,500 
payable by us, together totaling approximately $1,661,500. 

  

We expect to allocate the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

Research and development                                           $  3,600,000     40.7 %

Our research and development expenses will include further development and 
refinement of our proprietary thin-film solar cell fabrication processes, 
transfer of this process from development-scale hardware to production-scale 
hardware, analysis of the solar cells made by the production process, and 
packaging of our solar cells into products for initial field testing. 

  

The capital equipment we intend to purchase will consist primarily of 
development-scale vacuum deposition hardware, production-scale vacuum 
deposition hardware, measurement and test equipment, and solar cell packaging 
hardware. 

  

We expect to apply approximately $247,000 of the proceeds allocated to general 
corporate expenses to the payment over time of accrued wages and other payroll 
obligations. We also expect to pay off short-term notes of $230,000, plus 
interest, borrowed subsequent to September 30, 2003 to support current 
operations. Our general corporate expenses include general and administrative 
salaries, accounting and legal fees, consulting costs, patent costs, some 
facilities fees, and working capital needs. 

  

Pending such uses of the proceeds of the offering, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. 

  

The foregoing discussion is merely an estimate based on our current business 
plan. Our actual expenditures may vary depending upon circumstances not yet 
known, such as the time actually required to develop our manufacturing process 
or to successfully bring our products to market."

common stock in this offering, or about $112.3 million if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, based upon the initial offering 
price of $15.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and our estimated offering expenses. 

      We currently intend to use the estimated net proceeds of this offering as 
follows: 

   
   •   about $18.2 million to make cash payments to holders of shares of our 
Series A convertible preferred stock in connection with the conversion of these 
shares to our common stock upon completion of this offering;  
   
   •   about $13.6 million to make cash payments to holders of shares of our 
Series B convertible preferred stock in connection with the conversion of these 
shares to our common stock upon completion of this offering;  
   
   •   about $29.1 million to repay all indebtedness under our outstanding 
senior subordinated notes, about $727,500 to pay redemption premiums and about 
$688,000 to pay accrued interest to the holders of the notes;  
   
   •   pay about $108,000 of accrued interest on our subordinated convertible 
debentures on conversion; and  
   
   •   the balance of about $34.8 million to repay indebtedness under our 
senior credit facility.  


Until allocated for specific use, we will invest the proceeds in short-term 
government and other investment-grade debt securities. 

      Our Series A convertible preferred stock and Series B convertible 
preferred stock automatically convert into shares of our common stock upon the 
completion of this offering. When converted, each share of Series A convertible 
preferred stock will entitle the holder to receive, subject to adjustment, 
0.2257 of a share of common stock and a cash payment of $4.20 and each share of 
Series B convertible preferred stock will entitle the holder to receive, 
subject to adjustment, 0.2257 of a share of common stock and a cash payment of 
$5.22, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends from the date of issuance of the 
shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock to the conversion date. 

      We have outstanding senior subordinated notes in an aggregate principal 
amount of about $29.1 million. The notes bear interest at a rate of 14 3/4% per 
year and are due on July 18, 2008. The proceeds from the issuance of senior 
subordinated notes were used to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to fund 
a portion of the purchase price for recent acquisitions. 

      We have outstanding subordinated convertible debentures in an aggregate 
principal amount of about $3.1 million bearing interest at 4.0% per year. These 
debentures mature on April 1, 2005 and will automatically convert into shares 
of our common stock at $13.87 per share upon completion of this offering. 

      We have outstanding indebtedness under our senior credit facility of 
about $63.6 million. Borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest 
at a rate equal to a LIBOR rate or a base rate, each plus an applicable margin. 
The applicable margin for both the LIBOR rate and the base rate varies 
depending upon our leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2003, the interest rate 
for this debt ranged from 3.62% to 3.68% per year. The senior credit facility 
terminates and is due and payable on July 18, 2006. Borrowings under our senior 
credit facility were used to refinance outstanding indebtedness, to fund a 
portion of the purchase price for recent acquisitions and for working capital."

(1)     The amounts set forth in this table are approximate and assume a 
closing date of February 11, 2004.  

(2)     This includes a $10.0 million senior revolving credit facility and 
$30.0 million of senior term notes issued pursuant to our revolving credit and 
term loan agreement plus accrued interest of $27,000 and $41,000, respectively, 
as of February 11, 2004. These notes accrue interest at prime-based or 
Eurocurrency-based rates, at our option, and mature on October 1, 2006 and 
October 1, 2007, respectively. As of the date of this prospectus, we have made 
principal payments of $3.75 million on our senior term notes. We will use a 
portion of the proceeds from this offering to repay all amounts owing under 
these credit facilities.  

(3)     This includes a $5.0 million short-term loan guaranteed by Austin 
Ventures. This also includes a $34.5 million subordinated loan pursuant to a 
subordinated loan agreement with Austin Ventures plus accrued interest of $2.9 
million as of February 11, 2004. The short-term loan accrues interest at the 
greater of the bank’s prime rate or the weighted average rate on federal funds, 
plus 1%, and matures on February 20, 2004. The subordinated loan from Austin 
Ventures accrues interest at a rate of 17% per annum and matures on August 20, 
2008. We will use a portion of the proceeds from this offering to repay all 
amounts owing under these loans, including accrued interest. The following 
affiliates will receive proceeds from our repayment of the subordinated loan in 
the following respective approximate amounts: Austin Ventures VII, L.P., $18.6 
million, Austin Ventures VIII, L.P. $18.7 million, J. Ross Cockrell, one of our 
directors and a venture partner with Austin Ventures, $33,300, and Clark W. 
Jernigan, one of our directors and a principal with Austin Ventures, $33,300. 
 
(4)     This includes $29.5 million of redeemable preferred stock plus 
accumulated dividends of $1.2 million as of February 11, 2004. Our redeemable 
preferred stock accrues a cumulative dividend at a rate of 8% per annum. We 
will use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to redeem all outstanding 
redeemable preferred stock and pay all accumulated dividends thereon. The 
following affiliates will receive proceeds from our redemption of redeemable 
preferred stock in the following respective approximate amounts: Austin 
Ventures VII, L.P., $15.2 million, Austin Ventures VIII, L.P., $15.3 million, 
J. Ross Cockrell, $28,500, and Clark W. Jernigan, $28,500.  

  

We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds of the offering for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures 
and research and development. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to 
us to fund possible investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary 
businesses, products or technologies or to establish joint ventures. We have no 
current agreements or commitments with respect to any investment, acquisition 
or joint venture, and we currently are not engaged in negotiations with respect 
to any investment, acquisition or joint venture. Pending their ultimate use, we 
intend to invest the net proceeds to us from this offering in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment grade securities. 

  

Other than amounts to be used to repay outstanding indebtedness, redeem 
preferred stock and pay offering fees and expenses, the amount and timing of 
what we actually spend for the intended uses of proceeds above may vary 
significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future 
revenue and cash generated by operations and the other factors. Therefore, we 
will have broad discretion in the way we use the net proceeds of this offering."

discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, which are payable by

We intend to use these proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
clinical trials, research and development expenses, general and administrative 
expenses, manufacturing expenses and potential acquisitions of companies, 
products and technologies that complement our business. 

  

Although we periodically engage in preliminary discussions with respect to 
acquisitions, we are not currently a party to any agreements or commitments and 
we have no understandings with respect to any acquisitions. 

  

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on several factors, 
including the progress of our research and development efforts and the amount 
of cash used by our operations. We have not determined the amount or timing of

over-allotment option, the net proceeds from the sale of shares will be 
$16.2 million. “Net proceeds” are what we expect to receive after paying the 
underwriting discount and other expenses of the offering. 

      We intend to use $2.7 million of the net proceeds from this offering to 
open 15 new stores, all in the new format, in fiscal year 2004, and 
$3.6 million of the net proceeds to remodel 27 stores, including 17 in the new 
format, in fiscal year 2004. We also intend to use the net proceeds for the 
payment of up to $1.35 million of our subordinated debt, which includes a note 
payable and its related warrant. We may also use the net proceeds for working 
capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. Pending our use of 
the net proceeds for these purposes, we intend to repay amounts owing under our 
revolving credit facility, and invest any excess in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. We will retain broad discretion 
over the use of the net proceeds from this offering. 

      The $1.35 million in subordinated debt carries a weighted average 
interest rate of 15.7%, including interest and accretion on the note payable 
and accretion on the attached warrant. The subordinated debt matures on March 1, 
2004. As of January 3, 2004, indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
had an interest rate of 4.28% and a maturity of January 5, 2005.

under our credit facility and cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to 
meet our capital requirements for at least the next 12 months."

AIL has the right to cause us to register for sale the shares to be repurchased 
under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in connection with 
the Acquisition. In place of registration, we intend to repurchase these shares 
from AIL at the same price per share less the underwriting discounts we will 
receive from this offering. Consistent with the terms of the stockholders 
agreement, AIL is paying its share of the underwriting discounts relating to 
the proceeds from this offering used to redeem its shares, and we are paying 
all other expenses relating to this offering. Our board of directors has 
unanimously determined that the net effect to us of the proposed share 
repurchase is identical to the effect of a secondary offering.  

The proceeds received by our subsidiary, TRW Automotive Inc., from the offering 
of senior notes and senior subordinated notes, were used, together with other 
related financings described elsewhere in this prospectus, to finance the

based on an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we 
estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $45.6 million. 

  

Of the net proceeds that we will receive from the offering, we expect to use 
approximately: 

  

   •  $15.0 million for our sales and marketing operations; and  

  

   •  $5.0 million for product research and development.  

  

We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary 
products, technologies or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements 
or commitments to complete any such transactions and are not involved in 
negotiations to do so. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be 
based on many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated 
growth of our business. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds of this offering primarily in short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing instruments."

million at the maximum of the offering range and may be up to $55.3 million
assuming an increase in the estimated value of the common stock sold in the

Net cash proceeds retained by K-Fed Bancorp............       $13,229            $18,051          $20,824
                                                          ============  =================  ===============

     K-Fed Bancorp will retain up to 50.0% of the net stock offering proceeds
from which the loan will be made to the employee stock ownership plan, and will
invest the remaining proceeds in Kaiser Federal Bank. The portion of the net
proceeds used by K-Fed Bancorp to make a loan to the employee stock ownership
plan will enable the employee stock ownership plan to purchase up to 8.0% of the
shares of common stock sold in the stock offering. Based upon the sale of
3,655,000 shares of common stock and 4,945,000 shares of common stock at the
minimum and maximum of the estimated offering range, respectively, the loan to
the employee stock ownership plan would be $2.92 million and $3.96 million,
respectively. See ""Management - Benefits - Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" The
remaining net proceeds initially retained by K-Fed Bancorp may be used to invest
in U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various maturities,
mortgaged-backed or other securities, deposits in either Kaiser Federal Bank or
other financial institutions, or a combination thereof. The net proceeds may
ultimately be used to support Kaiser Federal Bank's lending activities and any
future expansion of operations, although no new banking offices or acquisition
transactions are specifically being considered at this time.

     The net proceeds from the stock offering may also be used for other
business and investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special
cash dividends, possible repurchases of the common stock or returns of capital.
K-Fed Bancorp and Kaiser Federal Bank have no plans, however, to declare or pay
any return of capital on the common stock. Management of K-Fed Bancorp may
consider expanding or diversifying its activities, as opportunities become
available.

     In the future, the board of directors of K-Fed Bancorp may determine, based
on the existing facts and circumstances, to repurchase shares of common stock,
subject to any applicable regulatory requirements. Repurchases of stock by K-Fed
Bancorp, which may be at prices above or below the initial offering price, will
generally be conducted through an open market repurchase program subject to
applicable regulations. Any stock repurchases will be subject to the
determination of K-Fed Bancorp's board of directors that Kaiser Federal Bank
will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after
any such repurchases. Such facts and circumstances may include, but will not be
limited to:

     o    market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is
          trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of
          other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk
          involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value
          and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and an
          improvement in K-Fed Bancorp's return on equity;

     o    the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue
          additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund
          employee stock benefit plans; and

     o    any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best
          interests of K-Fed Bancorp and its stockholders.

     The portion of the net proceeds used by K-Fed Bancorp to invest in Kaiser
Federal Bank will be added to Kaiser Federal Bank's general funds to be used for
general corporate purposes, including increased lending activities. While the
amount of net proceeds received by Kaiser Federal Bank will further strengthen
its capital position, which already exceeds all regulatory requirements, the
stock offering is not planned solely to increase Kaiser Federal Bank's
regulatory capital. The net proceeds may be used as described above to support
lending activities as well as future expansion of operations, although no new branches
or acquisitions are currently planned.

     The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the stock offering may
be more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the
number of shares to be sold in the stock offering is adjusted to reflect a
change in the estimated pro forma market value of Kaiser Federal Bank. Payments
for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at Kaiser
Federal Bank will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by
Kaiser Federal Bank but will result in a reduction of Kaiser Federal Bank's
interest expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing
certificates or other deposit accounts."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $23.3 million, after

$1.3 million and estimated offering expenses of approximately $1.4 million. If 
the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full, we estimate that 
the net proceeds will be approximately $27.0 million. 

  

The principal purposes of this offering are to: 

  

   •  increase our working capital, capitalization and financial flexibility; 
and  

  

   •  establish a public market for the Class B common stock, which will 
facilitate future access to public equity and debt markets, provide additional

The foregoing represents our current best estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of this offering, based on the expected use of funds necessary to 
finance our existing activities in accordance with our senior management’s 
current objectives and market conditions. The amounts actually expended by us 
for each purpose may vary significantly depending on a number of factors, such 
as the amount of cash used or generated by our operations, opportunities for 
the acquisition of assets, technologies or businesses, changes in competitive 
conditions and our senior management’s assessments of our specific operational 
and strategic needs. For example, if the amount of cash used or generated by 
our operations were to be adversely affected in any way, our senior management 
could reallocate amounts in its discretion to meet any shortfall in cash flow 
from operations. At the time of any such reallocation, our senior management 
may make determinations to allocate less or more of the net proceeds to the 
remaining categories based on our specific priorities and needs at that time. 
In addition, the amounts of the allocations, which are not fixed obligations, 
may be proportionately reduced in the event the actual net proceeds are less 
than the estimated amount above. Our senior management may spend the proceeds 
from this offering in ways the stockholders may not deem desirable.

Although we have no current agreements or commitments with respect to any 
acquisition, we may, if the opportunity arises, use a greater portion of the 
net proceeds to acquire or invest in products, technologies or companies. Any 
such acquisition could result in a reallocation of the estimated amounts set 
forth in the table above (which reallocation could be substantial). 

  

In addition, we may be required to make additional payments for earn-out 
obligations relating to our acquisitions of Enhance Interactive and 
TrafficLeader. 

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above purposes, we 
intend to invest the funds in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing 
securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds will yield a favorable 
return."

approximately $39.2 million, based upon the initial public offering price of 
$7.00 per share and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts, 
commissions and offering expenses. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately $45.3 million. 

      We expect to use approximately $25 to $30 million of the net proceeds of 
this offering to continue the clinical development of isatoribine (ANA245), 
ANA971, ANA97X, and LB80380 and advance the development of our antibacterial 
compounds. In particular, we expect to use these amounts to: 

   
   •   conduct a Phase I/II clinical trial for isatoribine beginning in April 
2004;  
   
   •   continue the Phase I clinical trial of ANA971 that we initiated in 
February 2004;  
   
   •   select a product candidate and initiate pre-clinical development in 
early 2004 from the ANA97X series;  
   
   •   following the exercise of our exclusive option to in-license LB80380, 
jointly conduct with LGLS the Phase II program of LB80380 for the treatment of 
chronic HBV; and  
   
   •   advance antibacterial compounds into pre-clinical studies;  


      We will need to raise substantial additional funds before we can expect 
to complete clinical trials, transition through the regulatory review and 
approval process, and commercialize any of these product candidates. 

      To a lesser extent, we anticipate using the remaining net proceeds of 
this 
offering: 

   
 
   •   to further our research and development programs, including our target 
identification and validation, high throughput screening, lead optimization and 
preclinical development programs; and  
 
   
   •   for general corporate purposes.  


      In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering 
to acquire products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our 
own, but, other than our exclusive option with LGLS, we currently have no 
commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions. 

      We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with 
interest thereon, our existing cash and cash equivalents and revenues we may 
generate from our collaborations, will be sufficient to meet our projected 
operating requirements for approximately the next two years. We expect to 
satisfy our future cash needs through the sale of equity securities, debt 
financings, corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements and grant 
funding, as well as through interest income earned on cash balances. 

      As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all 
of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion 
of this offering. The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on 
several factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and research and 
development efforts as well as the amount of cash used in our operations. 
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of 
the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our 
management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. We 
reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of certain 
contingencies such as the results of our drug discovery and development 
activities, competitive developments, opportunities to acquire products, 
technologies or businesses and other factors. 

      Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds of 
this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, 
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed 
obligations of the U.S. government."

$20,400,000, or $23,640,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund maintained by 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The 
proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the 
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in 
the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target 
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts 
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to 
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as 
determined by our board of directors at that time. 

The payment to Sherleigh Associates LLC, an affiliate of Jack Silver, one of our 
principal stockholders, of a monthly fee of $500 is for general and 
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial 
support. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the 
New York metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Sherleigh Associates LLC is 
at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. 

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $653,000) for 
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $125,000 for 
the twenty-four month period commencing 
on the date of this prospectus), with the balance being held in reserve in the 
event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and 
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates. 

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as 
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust 
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the 
operations of the target business. 

Kin Shing Li, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and Justin 
Tang, a member of our board of directors, each advanced to us $17,500, 
aggregating $35,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this 
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD 
registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loans bear interest at a rate 
of 4% per year and are payable on the earlier of October 6, 2004 or the 
consummation of this offering. These loans will be repaid out of the gross 
proceeds of this offering. 

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not 
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested in 
general debt obligations of the United States Government or other high-quality, 
short-term interest-bearing investments so that we are not deemed to be an 
investment company under the Investment Company Act. The interest income 
derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used 
to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to 
compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated 
professional fees, until a business combination is completed. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a 
business combination is not consummated during that time. 
Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of 
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Sherleigh Associates LLC 
the fee described above. Other than this $500 per month administrative fee, no 
compensation of any kind (including finders and consulting fees) will be paid 
to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services 
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business 
combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for 
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on 
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due 
diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of present 
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to 
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a 
business combination. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund 
(including interest earned on her portion of the trust fund) only in the event 
of our liquidation or if she were to seek to convert her shares into cash in 
connection with a business combination which she voted against and which we 
actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have 
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund."

      We will use net proceeds of approximately $69,105,000 from this offering 
to purchase our initial portfolio of residential mortgage loans for an 
approximate aggregate purchase price of $158,500,000, and we will use net 
proceeds of approximately $44,800,000 from this offering to purchase our 
initial portfolio of commercial mortgage bridge loan assets. In addition to the 
use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to borrow approximately 
$89,395,000 under our warehouse line of credit to complete the purchase of our 
initial portfolio of residential mortgage loans."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $43.5 million, based on the 
initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our 
net proceeds will be approximately $50.4 million. As of December 31, 2003, we 
had existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $37.3 million. 

  

We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering, and our existing cash, cash 
equivalents and short-term investments as follows: 

  

   ·     Approximately $40 million for launch and post-launch sales and 
marketing activities for rhIGF-1 for Severe Pediatric IGFD;  

  

   ·     Approximately $25 million for late-stage clinical trials of rhIGF-1 
for additional indications;  

  

   ·     Approximately $12 million for transfer and validation of the rhIGF-1 
manufacturing process; and  

  

   ·     Approximately $4 million for general corporate purposes, including 
the possible acquisition of new products or product candidates.  

  

We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to 
any acquisitions, investments or joint ventures and no portion of the net 
proceeds has been allocated for any specific acquisition. 

  

We will retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds of this 
offering. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures may vary 
significantly depending on numerous factors, such as the progress of our 
product development and commercialization efforts and the amount of cash used 
by our operations. 

  

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering, and existing cash and cash 
equivalents will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at 
least the end of 2005. Pending the use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate the net 
proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $34.6 million. 

  

We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and 
general corporate purposes, including: 

  

   ·     clinical trial activities, including our ongoing Phase I/II and Phase 
II clinical trials in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and multiple

opportunity arises, we may use a portion of the proceeds to acquire or invest

any businesses, products or technologies. Pending any ultimate use of any 
portion of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds in

we believe that the net proceeds of this offering, together with our cash, cash

acquisition of Puccini, see “Our Acquisition;”  

  

   •     up to US$85 million for funding future potential acquisitions and 
strategic alliances in the wireless value-added services, content and Internet 
industries in the PRC, although no material future potential acquisitions or 
strategic investments are pending other than as described in this prospectus. 
The timing for the application of the proceeds for future potential

our working capital, to purchase U.S. Treasury debt securities and other 
short-term investment grade debt securities or to deposit the proceeds into 
interest-bearing bank accounts. 

  

Our industry is evolving rapidly and could cause significant and rapid changes 
to our strategies and business plans. Accordingly, the actual application of 
the proceeds may change. As new business opportunities arise or circumstances 
change, we may reallocate all or part of the net proceeds to other business 
plans or new projects or hold such funds in temporary investments."

We estimate that approximately US$5.0 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering will be spent on research and development activities. We anticipate 
making approximately $1.4 million in capital expenditures in 2004 for software 
and technology infrastructure products and other items related to the expansion 
of our business such as computers and office furniture. We may use a portion of 
the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, technologies, services or 
products which are complementary to our core wireless value-added services 
business. However, we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect 
to any such transactions. We have not made any other specific expenditure plans

may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences 
of an investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a passive 
foreign investment company for United States federal income taxpayers, which 
could result in negative tax consequences for you."

listed above. We currently have no specific plans or agreements regarding any
expansion activities or acquisitions.

under the $7.6 million promissory note was 6.3% and the daily weighted average 
interest rate under the $2.2 million promissory note was 6.1%. Our credit

stock sold in the offering, which in turn will depend on RP Financial’s 
appraisal as well as regulatory and market considerations, and the expenses 
incurred in connection with the offering. Although we will not be able to 
determine the actual net proceeds from the sale of the common stock until we 
complete the offering, we estimate the net proceeds will be between $649.4 
million and $879.7 million, or $1.012 billion if the offering is increased by 
15%. 

The net proceeds may vary because the total expenses relating to the offering 
may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would 
increase if a syndicated community offering is used to sell shares not purchased 
in the subscription offering and community offering. The net proceeds will also 
vary if the number of shares to be sold in the offering is adjusted to reflect 
a change in the estimated pro forma market value of New Haven Savings Bank or 
if our employee stock ownership plan purchases shares in the open market at an 
average cost that is higher or lower than the $10.00 per share offering price. 
Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at 
New Haven Savings Bank will not result in the receipt of new funds for 
investment but will result in a reduction of New Haven Savings Bank’s deposits. 

We are undertaking the conversion and offering at this time primarily in order 
to provide the consideration for the acquisitions of Connecticut Bancshares and 
Alliance.  

The table below indicates the net proceeds to us based on the number of shares 
sold in the offering. In all cases except sales near the low end of the offering 
range, the proceeds will be sufficient to fund all conversion and acquisition 
expenses and the loan for the employee stock ownership plan. If sales of stock 
are near the low end of the range, we will borrow the funds necessary to fund 
the employee stock ownership plan from a third party lender.

The cash available at NewAlliance Bancshares, after paying the cash acquisition 
costs and lending funds to the employee stock ownership plan as shown above,

it to purchase the additional 2% of the shares of common stock issued in the 
conversion in addition to the 5% purchased by it in the conversion;

   •     To repurchase shares of our common stock;  

   •     To invest in securities;

understandings regarding any specific acquisition transaction; and  

   •     for other general corporate purposes, including investment of 
additional funds in New Haven Savings Bank.  


Initially, a substantial portion of the remaining net proceeds will be invested 
in short-term investments, investment grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed 
securities. 

New Haven Savings Bank could use funds from the offering provided to it by 
NewAlliance Bancshares as follows: 

   •     to fund new loans, including single-family mortgage loans, multi-family 
residential and commercial mortgage loans, commercial business loans, 
construction loans and consumer loans;  

   •     to expand its retail banking franchise by establishing or acquiring 
new branches or other financial services companies, although, except for the 
proposed acquisitions of Savings Bank of Manchester and Tolland Bank, we do not 
now have any agreements or understandings regarding any acquisition 
transactions;

      The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including the status of our research and development efforts,
the timing and success of preclinical testing, the timing and success of any
clinical trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory
submissions, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering, the amount
of cash generated by our operations, the amount of competition we face and how
successful we are with obtaining any required licenses and entering into
collaboration arrangements. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the
acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets
that complement our business. However, we have no present understandings,
commitments or agreements to enter into any potential acquisitions or
investments. We currently estimate that of the net proceeds from this offering
we will spend between $12 million and $15 million on our systemic RNAi research
and development activities, between $8 million and $10 million on our AMD and
other direct RNAi programs, and the remainder on the acquisition, licensing and
protection of intellectual property rights and on working capital, capital
expenditures and other general corporate purposes. Our management will have
broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this offering. We do not
expect the net proceeds from this offering to be sufficient to fund the
completion of the development of any product candidate and we expect to need to
raise additional funds prior to being able to market any product.

      Pending utilization of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term investment grade and
U.S. government securities."

offered by us at an initial public offering of $11.00 per share, after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, will be
approximately $18.6 million, or $21.6 million if our underwriters exercise their

offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including new
product development and potential acquisitions of complementary products and
businesses, and to repay debt of $3,000,000 to E-Z-EM. This debt, which we
originally incurred in 1997 and subsequently renewed, bears interest at an
annual rate of 1.50% and is payable on November 8, 2006. In the past we have
had, and in the future we may have, discussions regarding acquisitions of
complementary products and businesses.

common stock in this offering will be approximately $37.4 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $7.00 per share, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we estimate
that we will receive additional net proceeds of approximately $5.9 million.

      We estimate that we will use:

   •  approximately $18.0 million of these net proceeds to fund the               
      commercialization of our product candidates, including establishing sales   
      and marketing capabilities and manufacturing and distribution arrangements

      and clinical development of our existing product candidates;                
  
   •  approximately $2.0 million of these net proceeds to fund the discovery and  
      development of additional product candidates; and

      expenditures and other general corporate purposes.                          


      The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including the timing of the completion of clinical trials, the
timing of regulatory submissions and any terms or conditions imposed as a
condition of any approval of the controlled-release formulation of zileuton or
our other product candidates, the status of our product development and
commercialization efforts for all our programs, the amount of proceeds actually
raised in this offering, the amount of cash generated by our operations, the
amount of competition we face and how successful we are with sales and marketing
activities.

      We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or
investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our
business. However, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements
to enter into any potential acquisitions or investments. Furthermore, we have
not determined the amounts we plan to spend on any of the areas listed above or
the timing of these expenditures. As a result, our management will have broad
discretion to allocate these proceeds.

      We do not expect the net proceeds from this offering to be sufficient to
fund the completion of the development of our product candidates, other than
Zyflo, which, subject to regulatory approval, we expect to launch commercially
in the first half of 2005, and the controlled-release formulation of zileuton
for asthma, for which we anticipate submitting an NDA in 2005. We believe that
the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to complete the Phase I and
Phase II clinical trials of CTI-01 that we anticipate initiating in 2004. We
also believe the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to complete
the Phase I clinical trial of our intravenous formulation of zileuton and the
Phase II clinical trials of zileuton in COPD patients that we anticipate
initiating in 2004. The actual costs and timing of clinical trials and
associated activities to enable a regulatory submission, however, are highly
uncertain, subject to risk and will change depending upon the clinical
indication developed and the development strategy adopted. We also expect to
apply the proceeds of this offering to the development of product candidates
under our HMGB1 program and cholinergic anti-inflammatory program. However,
because these programs are still in the early stages of clinical development,
the actual costs and timing of research, preclinical development, clinical
trials and associated activities are highly uncertain, subject to risk and will
change depending upon the project chosen to be developed under the program, the
clinical indication developed and the development strategy adopted. We may need
to raise additional external funds prior to completing the development of our
product candidates other than Zyflo and the controlled-release formulation of
zileuton.

      Pending utilization of these proceeds, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term investment grade and U.S. government
securities."

estimated to be $57,950,000.

        We currently intend to use the net proceeds of the offering as follows:

        º approximately $19.1 million to repay all indebtedness to WexAir LLC,
          our majority stockholder; and

        º the remainder for general corporate purposes, including working

short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities.

        The indebtedness to be repaid to our majority stockholder was initially
incurred in May 1998 to finance a portion of the purchase price for Chautauqua.

common stock will be approximately $45.2 million or approximately $46.9 million
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. We also
intend to refinance our existing senior credit facility and enter into a
$90.0 million new senior credit facility (with approximately $9.1 million of
availability following this offering) which will mature in May 2007. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares, if any, by Steamboat
Industries LLC.

        We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering and a portion of
our new senior credit facility as follows:

        º $62.3 million to redeem or otherwise repurchase all of our 14% notes
          due 2006 at 104% of principal amount including accrued interest; and

        º $6.3 million to purchase all shares of our common stock held by our
          minority stockholders and an option to purchase common stock held by
          one minority stockholder, pursuant to a stockholders' agreement. 

        The amount needed to redeem or repurchase the 14% notes and to
repurchase all shares of our common stock held by our minority stockholders and
an option to purchase common stock held by one minority stockholder reflects a
March 31, 2004 closing. The notes accrue at 14% per year. The amounts due under
the stockholders' agreement accrete at 11.75% per year. An additional
$2.3 million would be needed to redeem or repurchase our 14% notes and meet our
obligations under the stockholders' agreement (assuming a June 30, 2004
closing), including accrued interest. Such additional funds would be financed
through borrowings under our new senior credit facility.

        We will also issue notes in an aggregate principal amount of
$5.0 million to the minority stockholders who are selling us common stock as
part of the purchase price. The minority stockholders have consented to the
assumption of this obligation by Steamboat Industries LLC and our release from
this obligation without recourse to us, which will be reflected as additional
paid-in capital in our financial statements.

        The amount and timing of the use of proceeds may vary depending upon a
number of factors, including but not limited to, the timing of the redemption of
the 14% notes. Until we use the proceeds of this offering for the above
purposes, we intend to reduce borrowings under our proposed new senior credit
facility or invest the funds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
securities."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $31.3 million, or
approximately $36.1 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
our estimated offering expenses.

 

We intend to use approximately $30 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to fund research and development activities, including clinical trials,
and preclinical development and research expenses. In particular, we anticipate
that a substantial portion of this $30 million will be used to complete our
planned Phase II clinical trials in each of our three internal development
programs, ACP-103 for treatment-induced dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease and
ACP-104 and ACP-103 for schizophrenia. However, due to the risks inherent in the
clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our programs,
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the total costs we will incur in
the continued development of our drug candidates for potential
commercialization. Due to these same factors, we are unable to determine the
anticipated completion dates for our research and development programs. In
addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which drug candidates
will be subject to future collaborative or licensing arrangements, when such
arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements
would affect our development plans and capital requirements.

 

We anticipate using the remaining balance of the net proceeds for working
capital and general corporate purposes. In particular, we expect to allocate the
balance of the net proceeds as follows: 30% for increased general and
administrative expenses, 25% for increased costs associated with potential
further expansion of our employee base and facilities, 15% for additional
equipment purchases, and 30% for miscellaneous working capital and general
corporate purposes. These expenditures are expected to include the hiring of
additional research and development staff and chemists, the relocation and
expansion of our facility near Copenhagen, and the purchase of robotics and
other laboratory equipment for our research and development activities.

 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary
technologies or products. To the degree that we pursue any of these
transactions, the amount of proceeds that we have available for working capital
and general corporate purposes may decrease. We have no present plans or
commitments relating to any of these types of transactions and are not currently
engaged in any negotiations with respect to any of these transactions.

 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend significantly upon
a number of factors, including the amount and timing of revenues from our
current or future collaborations and the progress in, and costs of, our clinical
and preclinical drug programs. Pending the use of the net proceeds from this
offering, we intend to invest these funds in short-term, interest-bearing
investment-grade securities."

common stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately
$57.0 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds of
approximately $65.9 million.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds of this offering,
together with our cash on hand and cash generated from operations, to fund our
operations, including:

     •  approximately $1.0 million for continued sales and marketing efforts for
        the IR 1200;

        our continuous glucose sensor;                                          
    
     •  approximately $1.0 million for expansion into international markets;

As of March 31, 2004, our outstanding bank lines of credit bore interest at 5.5%
and 5.75% and had maturity dates of January 5, 2005 and May 5, 2005,
respectively. These bank lines of credit were used for short-term funding for
working capital purposes.

The amounts actually expended for these purposes may vary significantly and will
depend on a number of factors, including the amount of our future net revenues,
expenses, and the other factors described under “Risk Factors.” Should we
determine to employ cash resources for the acquisition of complementary
businesses, products, or technologies, the amounts available for the purposes
cited above may be significantly reduced. Although we evaluate potential
acquisitions in the ordinary course of business, we have no specific
understandings, commitments, or arrangements with respect to any acquisition or
investment at this time.

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above purposes, we intend
to contribute the funds to a wholly owned subsidiary, which will invest the
funds in short-term, investment grade, and interest-bearing securities. We
cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return."

     $28,490,000, or $33,143,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as
determined by our board of directors at that time.


     The payment to Coqui Capital Partners, L.P., an affiliate of Isaac Kier,
our secretary, treasurer and a member of our board of directors, of a monthly
fee of $3,500 is for general and administrative services including office
space, utilities and secretarial support. We believe, based on rents and fees
for similar services in the New York, New York metropolitan area, that the fee
charged by Coqui Capital Partners is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person.

     We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $666,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $115,000),
with the balance of $115,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs.

     To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

     Lawrence S. Coben, our chairman and chief executive officer, has advanced
to us a total of $77,500 ($70,000 on February 17, 2004 and $7,500 on April 23,
2004) which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration
fee and legal fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on
the earlier of February 17, 2005 or the consummation of this offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

     The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

     We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

     Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the
consummation of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Coqui
Capital Partners the fee described above. Other than this $3,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder's and
consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with
the consummation of the business combination. However, our existing
stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will
be paid to those persons after a business combination.

     A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust fund."

approximately US$95 million, or approximately US$110 million if the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional ADSs is exercised in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by
us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders.

       As of the date of this prospectus, we have not allocated any specific
portion of the net proceeds of this offering for any particular purpose
discussed below. Our use of the net proceeds may take the form of purchases of
software, hardware or services, the hiring of personnel, the acquisition of
businesses or portions thereof, or other general corporate purposes. We
anticipate using the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

    •  approximately US$63 million for the enhancement of our existing business and
       operations, which is expected to include:                                   


       •  approximately US$43 million for games development, including expansion  
          of our game research and development center, acquisition of rights to   
          new online games or related technologies, and acquisition of copyrights 
          for materials that can be used to develop online games; and             
      
       •  approximately US$20 million to enhance our operational platform,        
          including a centralized user billing and verification system, a game    
          testing and evaluation center, a centralized Internet data center       
          management system, and a centralized Internet cafe communications system
          to enhance the relationship between us and our retail sales outlets;    


    •  approximately US$30 million for acquisitions or investments in businesses,  
       products or technologies that we believe are complementary to our own       
       business or otherwise extend our business or brand, including investments to
       explore delivering online games through other platforms such as online game 
       consoles; and                                                               
   
    •  the balance of approximately US$2 million for general corporate purposes.   


We do not currently have any agreements or understandings to make any material 
acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses. In utilizing the proceeds of 
this offering, we may make loans to our subsidiaries and consolidated PRC affiliated 
entities, or we may make additional capital contributions to these entities. Any loans 
or capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated PRC affiliated
entities are subject to PRC regulation and approval. For example:

    •  loans by us to Shengqu, as a foreign invested enterprise, to finance its    
       activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the   
       State Administration of Foreign Exchange; and                               
   
    •  loans by us to Shanda Networking or its subsidiaries, which are domestic PRC
       enterprises, must be approved by the relevant government authority and must 
       also be registered with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.       


       We may also determine to finance Shengqu by means of capital
contributions. These capital contributions must be approved by the Ministry of
Commerce. Because Shanda Networking and its subsidiaries are not foreign
invested enterprises, we are not likely to finance their activities by means of
a capital contribution due to regulatory issues relating to foreign investment
in domestic PRC enterprises, as well as the licensing and other regulatory
issues discussed in “Regulation” elsewhere in this prospectus. We cannot assure
you that we can obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely 
basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or capital contributions by us 
to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated PRC affiliated entities.

       The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use
and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans
and business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility
and discretion in applying the net proceeds of the offering. The occurrence of
unforeseen events or changed business conditions could result in application of
the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this
prospectus.

       Pending these uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term,
interest bearing, debt instruments or bank deposits. These investments may have
a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your
investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a passive foreign
investment company for United States federal income tax purposes, which could
result in negative tax consequences for you."
NUVASIVE INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/nuvasive-inc-150658-38147,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/nuvasive-inc-150658-38147,424B4,5/13/2004,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=2960844,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the 6,500,000 shares
of common stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately
$64.8 million, or approximately $74.8 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, based on the initial offering price to the public
of $11.00 per share, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and our estimated offering expenses.

        The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional
capital, to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our
future access to the public equity markets. We expect to use a majority of the
net proceeds from this offering to expand our sales and marketing activities, to
fund research and development relating to potential new products and to repay
substantially all of our outstanding debt obligations of approximately
$6.3 million. To a lesser extent, we expect to use the net proceeds of this
offering to finance regulatory approval activities and for general corporate
purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to
acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, or technologies, or to
obtain the right to use such complementary technologies. We have no commitments
with respect to any acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved
in any negotiations with respect to any such transaction.

        As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all
of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion
of this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend
on numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts,
sales and marketing activities, technological advances, amount of cash generated
or used by our operations and competition. Accordingly, our management will have
broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the
proceeds of this offering.

        A portion of the gross proceeds from this offering, in the form of
underwriting discounts and commissions, will be paid to William Blair & Company.
Arda M. Minocherhomjee, one of our directors, is a managing director and a
member of William Blair Capital Partners, L.L.C., which is affiliated with
William Blair & Company. To the extent legally permissible, we may also use some
of the net proceeds from this offering to provide indemnification to certain of
our current and former officers. See ""Business—Legal Proceedings"" for a
description of the associated legal proceedings. Although we cannot be sure of
the ultimate cost of this litigation, we have allocated up to $1.0 million of
the proceeds from this offering for payment of indemnification expenses.

        Of the approximately $6.3 million of net proceeds that we intend to use
to repay outstanding debt, approximately $6.0 million will be paid to our bank
to repay a secured credit facility pursuant to which we have drawn down, as of
March 31, 2004, approximately $6.0 million out of the maximum limit of
$9.6 million. This secured credit facility may be used to borrow against
qualified accounts receivable and fixed assets. The interest rate on this
facility is lender's prime plus one-half of one percent, with maturity dates
through December 2007.

        Additionally, of the approximately $6.3 million of net proceeds that we
intend to use to repay outstanding debt, approximately $200,000 will be paid to
GATX Ventures, Inc. as payment in full of all remaining outstanding amounts
under an equipment loan and security agreement. Amounts borrowed under this loan
bear interest in a range of 10.7% to 11.9% and the loan matures in July 2005.

        Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds
in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. We believe that
our current cash and cash equivalents, excluding the proceeds from this
offering, together with our short-term investments, the cash to be generated
from expected product sales and our ability to draw down on our secured
revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating
requirements for at least the next 12 months."

repay all intercompany indebtedness to Resource America, which was $790,000 at
December 31, 2003, and distribute the balance to Resource America in accordance
with the master separation and distribution agreement."

approximately $101.0 million after deducting estimated underwriting discounts

receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

        We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to repay
approximately $80.5 million of outstanding indebtedness and to retain
approximately $20.5 million for general corporate purposes, which may include
acquisitions, although we have no specific agreements or commitments to
consummate any acquisitions. Accordingly, we will have considerable discretion
in the application of these remaining proceeds. We are required to repay
outstanding indebtedness under our senior credit facility in an amount equal to
at least 50% of the net proceeds from this offering received by us. Interest on
the Exelon note has been paid in kind since issuance. The repayment of
indebtedness consists of the following:

       
        º approximately $50.5 million to repay a portion of the term loans under
          our senior credit facility;

        
        º approximately $30.0 million to repay the subordinated promissory note
          payable to Exelon; and

    
        º interest accrued on the subordinated promissory note payable to Exelon
          through the closing date of this offering.

        We incurred all of this debt to finance the Exelon Transaction,
including the acquisition of the additional entity in December 2003. As of
December 31, 2003, the term loans, which mature on September 30, 2010, bore
interest at a blended annual rate of 6.28%, and the subordinated promissory note
payable to Exelon, which matures on September 30, 2011, bore interest at an
annual rate of 6%. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds from this offering received by us in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment grade securities."

corporate purposes, including, but not limited to (i) the repayment of $16.0
million of debt incurred under our $16.0 million unsecured revolving credit
facility, (ii) the funding of our existing $20.3 million of commitments to
Greenhill Capital Partners, and (iii) the establishment of new merchant banking
funds in which we, through our controlling interest in the general partner of
the funds, expect to make certain principal investments. We expect our
investments in new funds to be made over a period of several years. Pending
specific application of the net proceeds, we expect to use the net proceeds to
purchase U.S. Government securities, other short-term, highly-rated debt
securities and money market funds.

Our $16.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility matures on June 30, 2005,
and the interest rate on borrowings under the facility is, at our option, either
LIBOR plus 2.5% or the prime rate. Proceeds of the $16.0 million in borrowings

short-term borrowings incurred under our Citigroup financing arrangement. We use
the proceeds from the short-term borrowings under the Citigroup financing
arrangement to fund manufactured home loan originations and purchases. The
portion of this debt that we intend to repay with net proceeds from this
offering accrues interest at a weighted average annual rate of approximately
2.5%. As of March 31, 2004, approximately $134.4 million was outstanding under
the Citigroup financing arrangement. Of this amount, approximately $70.6 million
is due on November 16, 2004, approximately $26.5 million is due March 29, 2005

our bank credit facility bear interest at the rate of the greater of 4.25% or
the prime lending rate plus 0.25% and mature on July 31, 2005. As of May 31,
2004, the outstanding balance under the operating line of credit was $687,000
and the effective rate of interest was 4.25%. Amounts borrowed under the
equipment line of credit bear interest at the rate of 4.50% and mature on
July 31, 2005. As of May 31, 2004, the outstanding balance under the equipment
line of credit was $2.5 million. During fiscal year 2003, we used amounts
borrowed under the credit facility for working capital purposes, including for
the acquisition of inventory, property and equipment.

 

We also may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of
complementary businesses or products in the event that an attractive opportunity
presents itself in the future. We have no current agreements or commitments with
respect to any acquisition. Pending application of the net proceeds, we will
invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
securities."

approximately €78.6 million, or €91.2 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions of approximately €5.7 million, or approximately €6.5
million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, and
estimated offering expenses payable by us, of approximately €2.9 million, based
upon a weighted-average offering price of €12.18 per share (€12.16 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full).

We intend to use these proceeds to continue to fund clinical trials of
satraplatin, to make regulatory filings for marketing approval of satraplatin,
and to fund our other clinical, preclinical and research programs, including our
monoclonal antibody program (1D09C3) and cell cycle inhibitor program
(RGB-286199).

We currently estimate that from the net proceeds of this offering we will spend
between 50% and 60% to continue to fund clinical trials of satraplatin, to
broaden the potential anticancer applications of this drug candidate, and to
make regulatory filings for marketing approval of satraplatin; between 20% and
30% to fund our other clinical, preclinical and research programs, including our
monoclonal antibody program (1D09C3) and cell cycle inhibitor program
(RGB-286199), and to invest in new capabilities relating to our research and
development activities; and between 15% and 25% for general corporate purposes,
which may include the licensing of other product candidates, technologies, or
intellectual property.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditure will depend on numerous
factors, including the timing and success of our Phase 3 registrational trial
for satraplatin, the timing and success of any clinical trials and preclinical
studies we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions, the
status of our research and development efforts, the amounts of proceeds actually
raised in this offering, the timing and scope of potential partnering and
licensing activities for our product candidates and technologies as well as for
new product candidates and technologies and the amount of cash generated by our
operations. Because we operate in a very dynamic and highly competitive
industry, the actual use of proceeds may differ substantially from the ranges
indicated above. Our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net
proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest them in short-term and
medium-term interest-bearing instruments.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
shareholders."

offered by us are estimated to be approximately $73.9 million, after deducting
the underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, based upon an
initial public offering price of $18.50, or approximately $80.7 million if the
over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full. We will not
receive any of the proceeds from the shares of our common stock sold by the
selling shareholders.

      A principal purpose of this offering is to establish a public market for
our common stock. We expect to use all of the net proceeds of this offering,
except as described below, to finance our growth by opening additional sports,
fitness and family recreation centers. This includes approximately $20 to
$25 million for the purchase of land for centers we plan to open in 2005 and
approximately $15 to $20 million for the construction of the center we opened in
June 2004 and the five remaining centers to be opened this year. This also
includes approximately $10 to $15 million for the purchase of the initial
exercise equipment, furniture and fixtures for the center we opened in June 2004
and the five remaining centers to be opened this year. We expect to use a
portion of the net proceeds to completely repay amounts outstanding under our
revolving credit facility as soon as practicable after receiving the proceeds
from this offering, which amount could range from the $3 million that could be
repaid as of March 31, 2004 to $15 million. The revolving credit facility bears
interest at 4.0% over LIBOR and expires on June 30, 2005. The amounts to be
repaid under the revolving credit facility were borrowed within the past year
and were used to fund the acquisition of land and construction of centers we
plan to open in 2004 and other working capital needs. We also expect to use
approximately $9 million of the net proceeds of this offering to repay a loan
under the construction facility that we used to finance the development of our
center in Plano, Texas. The term loan bears interest at 0.5% over the prime rate
and expires on April 10, 2006.

      The amounts and timing of our actual use of proceeds will depend upon
numerous factors, including our plans for the construction and opening of new
centers and our ability to obtain and extend our debt financing on favorable
terms. The amounts that we may allocate to the particular uses of the net
proceeds of this offering may vary from the above based primarily on amounts
outstanding under our revolving credit facility and the distinct timing
implications between membership dues generated and when funds are needed. In
addition, the amount used for any particular component of constructing and
opening a new center may vary depending on increases and decreases in costs of
the different components and our ability to negotiate pricing. Although we do
not currently have any specific plans for other uses of the proceeds, there are
other potential uses of the proceeds, including expediting future land
purchases, technological investment in our current in-center and corporate
businesses, investment in our current corporate headquarters, acquisitions of
free-standing single unit health clubs, acquisitions of other health club
companies and initial investments in additional corporate businesses. Our
management will have significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net
proceeds of this offering. Until we use the proceeds for a particular purpose,
we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering generally in short-term,
investment-grade instruments, interest-bearing securities or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States, but we cannot assure you that these
investments will yield a favorable return."

        The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the
offering may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would
increase if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common
stock not purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering.
Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will
not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but will result in a
reduction of First Federal's deposits. In all instances, First Federal will
receive at least 50% of the net proceeds of the offering.

        We are undertaking the offering at this time in order to increase our
capital and have the capital resources available to expand and diversify our
business. For further information, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Business Strategy"" on page 39.
The offering proceeds will increase our capital resources and the 
amount of funds available to us for lending and investment purposes. The
proceeds will also give us greater flexibility to diversify operations and
expand the products and services we offer to our customers.

FIRST FEDERAL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. MAY USE THE PROCEEDS IT RETAINS FROM THE
OFFERING:

        o       to finance the purchase of common stock in the offering by our
                employee stock ownership plan;

        o       to invest in securities;

        o       to repurchase its shares of common stock;

        o       to pay cash dividends to our stockholders;

        o       to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches
                and other financial services businesses, although no specific
                transactions are being considered at this time; or

        o       for general corporate purposes.

        Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not
repurchase shares of our common stock during the first year following the
offering, except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior
regulatory approval. The loan that will be used to fund the purchases by the
employee stock ownership plan will accrue interest.

FIRST FEDERAL MAY USE THE PROCEEDS IT RECEIVES FROM THE OFFERING:

        o       to fund new loans, including one- to four-family mortgage loans,
                multi-family real estate loans and commercial real estate loans;

        o       to support new products and services;

        o       to invest in securities;

        o       to expand its retail banking franchise, by establishing or
                acquiring new branches or by acquiring other financial
                institutions, or other financial services companies, or their
                assets, although no transactions are specifically being
                considered at this time; or

        o       for general corporate purposes.

        The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on changes in
interest rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial
services industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall
market conditions."

         $30,840,000, or $35,916,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option
is exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
The proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as
determined by our board of directors at that time.



         The payment to Crescendo Advisors II LLC, an affiliate of Eric S.
Rosenfeld, our chairman, chief executive officer and president, of a monthly fee
of $7,500 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the New York, New York metropolitan area, that the fee
charged by Crescendo Advisors II LLC is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination,
we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

         We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $870,000)
for director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $115,000),
with the balance of $755,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs.


         To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.


         Eric S. Rosenfeld, our chairman, chief executive officer and president,
has advanced to us a total of $77,500 ($70,000 on April 14, 2004 and $7,500 on
May 25, 2004) which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration
fee and legal fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on
the earlier of April 14, 2005 or the consummation of this offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.


         The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

         We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

         Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the
consummation of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Crescendo
Advisors II LLC the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder's and
consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the
business combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

         A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
fund (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund)
only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek
to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust fund."

         $30,840,000, or $35,916,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option
is exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
The proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as
determined by our board of directors at that time.



         The payment to Crescendo Advisors II LLC, an affiliate of Eric S.
Rosenfeld, our chairman, chief executive officer and president, of a monthly fee
of $7,500 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the New York, New York metropolitan area, that the fee
charged by Crescendo Advisors II LLC is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination,
we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

         We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $870,000)
for director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $115,000),
with the balance of $755,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs.


         To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.


         Eric S. Rosenfeld, our chairman, chief executive officer and president,
has advanced to us a total of $77,500 ($70,000 on April 14, 2004 and $7,500 on
May 25, 2004) which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration
fee and legal fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on
the earlier of April 14, 2005 or the consummation of this offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.


         The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

         We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

         Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the
consummation of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Crescendo
Advisors II LLC the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder's and
consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the
business combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a

from the sale by us of 6,250,000 shares of common stock in this offering, based
upon an initial public offering price of $20.00 per share and after deducting
the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering
expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common
stock by the selling stockholders in this offering.

 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to continue to build and
open new destination retail stores as well as to repay the amount outstanding
under our $230 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of June 24, 2004
the amount outstanding was approximately $35.6 million and we expect the amount
outstanding will be approximately $37.0 million to $42.0 million immediately
prior to completion of this offering. We currently plan to open one destination
retail store in 2004 and two destination retail stores in 2005 with the cost of
each store ranging from $45 million to $70 million. The revolving credit
facility requires that the proceeds of any public offering be used to repay any
amounts outstanding under the facility. The revolving credit facility expires on
June 30, 2007, and has a LIBOR-based rate of interest plus a spread of between
0.80% and 1.425% based upon our achievement of certain cash flow leverage
ratios.

 

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our current plans and
business condition. We will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds from this offering, and the occurrence of unforeseen events or changes
in business conditions could result in the application of the net proceeds from
this offering in a manner other than described in this prospectus. Pending
application of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment grade securities."

approximately $27.6 million of the net proceeds of this offering we receive to
repay amounts outstanding under our loan agreements and the remainder for
general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures,
including expenditures of approximately $4.7 million related to the construction
of MFC 2, our second manufacturing facility in China.

 

Subsequent to September 30, 2003, but prior to the date of this prospectus, we
borrowed $19.0 million from Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, or
Norddeutsche, and $6.6 million from Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and used
the proceeds for working capital, further investments in MFC 2, repayment of our
outstanding loan with General Electric Business Asset Funding Corporation, or GE

As a result, as of March 31, 2004, we had $0 of outstanding debt to GE Capital.
We entered into our line of credit with Norddeutsche in November 2003. Prior to
drawing on our line of credit with Norddeutsche to repay our debt to GE Capital,
to reduce our debt to Bank of China and for other working capital purposes, we
had drawn approximately $5.0 million on our line of credit that has been used in
connection with the construction of MFC 2.

 

As of June 21, 2004, our outstanding borrowings were approximately $27.6
million, as follows:

interest rate charged by international banks to borrow U.S. Dollars in the
Singapore money market.

 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary
businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies.
We have no commitments with respect to any acquisition.

proceeds of this offering we receive in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities."

secured promissory notes issued in October 2002 to certain of our stockholders,
which bear interest at the rate of 11% per annum and would otherwise be payable

proceeds will be approximately $141.4 million. We intend to use the net proceeds
of this offering as follows:

       annual rate of 3%, as distributions equal to NYMC's paid-in equity and
       retained earnings as of August 31, 2003;
 
     - approximately $101.8 million to purchase on a leveraged basis (likely
       eight to 12 times) an initial portfolio of residential mortgage-backed
       securities that are guaranteed by a government sponsored entity or rated

     - approximately $6.75 million for general corporate purposes, including
       working capital and potential future acquisitions.
 
     We may need a significant amount of time to fully invest the available net
proceeds of this offering in our intended investments and to fully implement our
leveraging strategy to increase the total amount of our investments to our
desired level. In the meantime, funds will be committed to interest-bearing
short-term investment grade securities which are consistent with our intention
to qualify as a REIT. We will not leverage our temporary investment in these
securities. These investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we
hope to achieve from our intended use of the proceeds of this offering.

of the underwriting discount, will be approximately $229.2 million. If the
underwriters’ option to purchase up to 2,640,000 additional shares is exercised
in full, we will receive additional net proceeds of approximately $34.4 million.
To the extent that the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is
exercised in part, the number of shares we will sell will be reduced pro rata.

We will contribute the net proceeds of the offering to our operating
partnership, Strategic Hotel Funding, L.L.C., in exchange for membership units
in our operating partnership representing a 48% interest. Our operating
partnership intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $229.2 million

         mortgages secured by all but one of our operating partnership’s       
         current domestic properties, including the Distributed Properties,    
         that would otherwise mature on February 9, 2005, subject to three

stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions

proceeds will be approximately $68.0 million. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders
in this offering.

      We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

   •  $10.5 million to repay an outstanding term loan;                            
  
   •  $25.6 million to repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit

      Corporation of America.                                                     


      As of March 31, 2004, we had $10.5 million outstanding under a term loan
that matures on September 30, 2006. The term loan bears interest at the floating
rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% to 3.5%. As of March 31, 2004, the interest rate was
4.375%. This term loan was incurred to finance acquisitions, operating capital
and general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2004, we had approximately
$34.1 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility that matures on
September 30, 2006. The revolving credit facility bears interest at a floating
rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% to 3.5%. As of March 31, 2004, the interest rate was
4.375%. This revolving credit facility was used for acquisitions, operating
capital and general corporate purposes. As disclosed above, we will repay
$36.1 million of indebtedness under the term loan and revolving credit facility
with the net proceeds of this offering.

      In connection with this offering, we will amend and restate our credit
facility. After making the repayments discussed above, we expect to have
borrowing capacity under our amended and restated $150 million credit facility.
This credit facility will allow us to borrow to fund strategic acquisitions of
other solid waste businesses subject to our compliance with certain financial
covenants. Please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — New
Credit Facility.”

      As part of our internal reorganization we agreed to contribute
$20.0 million to our former parent, Waste Corporation of America upon completion
of this offering. Of this amount, approximately $13.9 million, including
$0.6 million of accrued interest, will be used to repay a note issued to Waste
Management, Inc. in connection with our purchase of assets in September 2000.
The remaining balance of $6.1 million represents an amount required to separate
our operations from Waste Corporation of America. Because a portion of the
contribution obligation (which will be satisfied with the proceeds of this
offering) is being used to satisfy this note, the note balance has been
reflected in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this
prospectus. We do not have any ongoing obligations to make future payments to
Waste Corporation of America to fund its operations.

      At this time, we do not have probable acquisitions that are significant
enough to require us to provide historical and pro forma financial information.
We are, however, conducting discussions concerning potential acquisitions."

exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option will be approximately
$32.1 million, based upon an initial public offering price of $6.00 per share
and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and estimated offering
expenses. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $37.1 million.

        We estimate we will use approximately $18 million to $28 million of the
net proceeds of this offering, assuming no exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment option, to continue the discovery and development of flavors and
flavor enhancers in our sweet, savory and salt enhancer programs. In particular,
we expect to use these amounts to:

        º conduct metabolism and 90-day sub-chronic safety studies for S336 and
          S807 and discover and develop other compounds in our savory program;

        º create derivatives of S395 and S888 and to discover and develop other
          compounds with improved sweet enhancement activity;

        º create derivatives of S969 and to discover and develop compounds with
          improved salt receptor enhancement activity;

        º conduct metabolism and safety studies for product candidates in our
          sweet and salt enhancement programs; and

        º continue to synthesize and develop new compounds to identify
          additional flavors and flavor enhancers in each of our programs, which
          may be used by our existing collaborators or new collaborators.

Because we track and forecast our expenses by type of expense rather than by
specific program, we cannot estimate more specifically how much of the proceeds
will be spent on any particular program.

        We estimate we will use approximately $2 million to $4 million of the
net proceeds of this offering, assuming no exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment option, to maintain and expand our intellectual property position
and fund the discovery of new taste receptors and acquisition of technologies,
product rights or businesses, although we have no current agreements or
commitments for, nor are we actively seeking, any such acquisition.

        We estimate we will use approximately $6 million to $8 million of the
net proceeds of this offering, assuming no exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment option, to fund working capital and general corporate purposes,
including costs related to executive, legal, risk management, business and
corporate development functions, finance and accounting.

        We have not determined the amount or timing of these expenditures. To
the extent we use more of the net proceeds of this offering in any one of the
above categories, less of the proceeds will be available for the other
categories. Pending the contemplated uses described above, we will invest the
net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade
securities.

        Our management has broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds of
this offering among the categories set forth above and other uses. The amount
and timing of our actual expenditures and our future liquidity and capital
requirements are subject to change and will depend on many factors, some of
which may be beyond our control, including:

        º the progress and capabilities of our discovery and development
          programs;

        º our ability to maintain existing and establish new product discovery
          and development collaborations; and

        º competitive, technological, intellectual property, regulatory, market
          and other events and developments.

        We may not be able to discover compounds that have the desired
enhancement effect, that are safe, that are eligible for FEMA GRAS determination
or that have appropriate attributes required for use in successful commercial
products. However, assuming that our current flavor and flavor enhancer
discovery and development programs proceed as we currently anticipate, we expect
that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing capital
resources, interest income and revenue from our existing collaborations, should
be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital
requirements for over 12 months, and should allow us to obtain FEMA GRAS

common stock in this offering will be approximately $30.9 million, based on an
initial public offering price of $6.50 per share and after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we
estimate that we will receive additional net proceeds of approximately
$4.9 million. We intend to use the majority of the net proceeds, together with
existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which totaled
approximately $31.2 million at March 31, 2004, to fund:

       
        º the approval and subsequent commercialization of near-term product
          candidates, including approximately $8.0 million to $10.0 million to
          develop M-Dalteparin through the filing of an ANDA; and

        
        º the development of improved product candidates, including using
          approximately $12.0 million to $15.0 million to develop M118 through
          Phase I and Phase IIa clinical trials and $3.0 million to $5.0 million
          for the initial development of pulmonary formulations of therapeutic
          proteins.

        We anticipate using the remaining net proceeds of this offering,
together with available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, to
fund:

      
        º the research and discovery of novel therapeutics and technologies; and

       
        º working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate
          purposes.


        In addition, we may also use a portion of the proceeds, together with
available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, for the acquisition
of, or investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that
complement our business. However, we have no present understandings, commitments
or agreements to enter into any potential acquisitions or investments.

        We anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be
sufficient to fund our operations for at least 36 months.

        The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including the timing and success of any clinical trials we may
commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions, the status of our
research and development efforts and timing, the amount of proceeds actually
raised in this offering, the amount of cash generated by our operations, the
amount of competition we face and the success we have with obtaining any
required licenses and entering into collaboration arrangements. As a result, our
management will have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this
offering. Pending utilization of the net proceeds as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term investment grade and
U.S. government securities."

       We are required to use 50% of the net proceeds of this offering to repay
indebtedness under the term loans of our existing senior credit facility. We
intend to use approximately $44.1 million of our net proceeds from the offering
to repay borrowings outstanding under the term loans of our existing senior
credit facility. As of December 31, 2003, we had $51.9 million of borrowings
outstanding under our senior credit facility, consisting of approximately
$28.2 million under our revolving line of credit and $23.7 million under our
existing term loan, which bore interest at a weighted average rate of 3.76%
annually. As of March 31, 2004, we had $40.0 million of additional borrowings
outstanding under our third amended and restated senior secured credit facility
pursuant to our add-on term loan facility used to fund our special distribution.
Of the repayments of our outstanding borrowings, we anticipate that we will
repay borrowings from our existing term loan, which matures on April 15, 2007,
and add-on term loan facility, which matures on March 31, 2009, on a pro rata
basis in the amounts of $8.4 million and $15 million, respectively, from our net
proceeds from the offering. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

proceeds to repay the principal and accrued interest on several outstanding
loans to certain of our directors, officers, principal shareholders, employees
and their relatives and certain entities in which they own an interest. All of
these loans are demand notes that bear interest at 8% per year, except for
demand notes in the amount of $569,000 which bear interest at the prime rate.
See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”.

       We also intend to apply the balance of our remaining net proceeds of
$20.7 to pay down our revolving line of credit under our third amended and
restated senior secured credit facility.

Tier 1 capital, however, the Bank has received confirmation from the FDIC that
it will be able to include a portion of the minority interest represented by the
Series D preferred shares as Tier 1 capital of the Bank and the remainder as
Tier 2 capital. In future periods, a portion of this Tier 2 capital may become
Tier 1 capital as the Bank increases its stockholders' equity through the
retention of future earnings or if we redeem our preferred shares. This will
permit the Bank to increase its asset base and expand its business generally and
enable the Bank to repurchase shares of its common stock as opportunities arise.
The Bank may expand its business through additional loan purchases or

on April 1, 2005 and accrues interest at a variable rate equal to the seven-day
""AA"" financial commercial paper rate plus approximately 1.02% and (e) a note
payable to Interstate Auto Auction in the amount of $1.8 million, which is
payable upon demand until its maturity in 2011 and accrues interest at a
variable rate equal to prime.

The outstanding intercompany debt that we intend to repay consists of the
following: (a) a note payable to ALLETE in the amount of $100 million, which is
payable upon demand and accrues interest at a rate of 2% per year,
(b) $141.2 million outstanding under our revolving line of credit with ALLETE,
which terminates on December 31, 2004 and accrues interest at a variable rate
equal to the ""A1-P1"" commercial paper rate plus 0.6% and (c) a note payable to
ALLETE in the amount of $3.4 million, which matures on June 1, 2006 and accrues
interest at a variable rate equal to prime plus 1%.

initial public offering price of $14.00 per share and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital
and to create a public market for our common stock.

 

We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including working capital, research and development expenses, general
and administrative expenses and capital expenditures. We have not yet identified
the amounts we plan to spend on each of these areas or the timing of

approximately $35.8 million.

        We intend to use a majority of the net proceeds from this offering to
continue the development of MB07133, our product candidate for the treatment of
primary liver cancer, MB07803, our clinical development candidate for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes, and the lead compounds in our advanced research
programs.

        To a lesser extent, we anticipate using the remaining net proceeds from
this offering to:

        º continue and expand our other research and development activities,
          including further development of our product pipeline, and

        º fund other working capital and general corporate purposes.

        In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
to acquire or in-license products, technologies or businesses, but we currently
have no agreements or commitments relating to any of these types of
transactions.

        As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all
of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion
of this offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering.

        The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several
factors, including the progress of our research and development efforts and the
amount of cash used by our operations. Pending their uses, we plan to invest the
net proceeds of this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

        We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be sufficient
to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the next two
years. Depending on the timeliness and results of our clinical trials and the
regulatory response from the FDA, we believe that at the end of this two-year
period MB07133 would be in Phase II or potentially Phase III clinical trials and
MB07803 would be in Phase II clinical trials. However, due to the risks inherent
in the clinical trial process, we cannot guarantee that clinical trials of these
product candidates will be completed successfully or in a timely manner."

approximately $59.7 million, based upon the initial public offering price of
$12.00 per share and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and offering expenses. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $68.9 million.

        We expect to use a majority of the net proceeds of this offering to
manufacture and market our gamma cameras, build our sales and marketing
capabilities, expand our DIS business and repay outstanding lines of credit and
notes payable of approximately $9.7 million.

        To a lesser extent, we anticipate using the remaining net proceeds of
this offering:

        º •
        º for further research and development relating to our existing products
          and new product opportunities and to finance regulatory approval
          activities; and

        In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
to acquire products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our
own, but we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these
types of transactions.

        Of the approximately $9.7 million of net proceeds that we intend to use
to repay outstanding lines of credit and notes payable, we will use
approximately $4.7 million to repay in full our outstanding balance as of
March 31, 2004 under our secured credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. The
secured credit facility may be used to borrow against accounts receivable and
fixed assets and our outstanding balance matures in October 2004. The secured
credit facility bears an interest rate equal to the lender's prime rate, plus
1.75% per annum, but in no event less than 5.75%.

        Additionally, of the approximately $9.7 million of net proceeds that we
intend to use to repay outstanding lines of credit and notes payable, we will
use approximately $4.5 million to repay in full our outstanding balance as of
March 31, 2004 under our credit facility with GE Healthcare Financial Services.
The total amount outstanding under the line of credit matures in December 2004
and the interest rate under such agreement is the greater of the lender's prime
rate plus 1.25% per annum, or 6%.

        Furthermore, of the approximately $9.7 million of net proceeds that we
intend to use to repay outstanding lines of credit and notes payable, we intend
to repay the principal amount outstanding under notes payable held by two of our
stockholders which matures within 60 days of the completion of this offering. As
of March 31, 2004, the outstanding principal amount under these notes was
approximately $490,000 and the notes bear an interest rate of 6.35% per year. We
may also enter into a similar agreement to repay the principal amount
outstanding under a note held by another stockholder. As of March 31, 2004, the
outstanding principal amount under such note, which bears an interest rate of
6.35% per year, was approximately $245,000.

        As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all
of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion
of this offering. The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on
several factors, including the amount of revenue generated from our operations,
the progress of our commercialization efforts, and the amount of cash used in
our operations. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of
our management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. We
reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of certain
contingencies such as the results of our commercialization efforts, competitive
developments, opportunities to acquire products, technologies or businesses and
other factors.

        Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds of
this offering in short- and medium-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."
"CBRE GROUP, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cbre-group-inc-85741-37821,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cbre-group-inc-85741-37821,424B4,6/10/2004,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3013550,"The net proceeds from the sale of the 7,726,764 shares of common stock offered
by us will be approximately $135.7 million, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will
not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares to be sold by the selling
stockholders.

The primary purposes of the offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, obtain additional equity capital and facilitate future access to
public markets. We expect to use our net proceeds from the offering to redeem
the remaining $38.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 16% senior notes
due 2011 and $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3/4% senior
notes due 2010 and to prepay $16.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the
term loan under our amended and restated credit agreement. The amended and
restated credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities
currently would limit our ability to complete such redemptions or prepayment. We
have entered into an amendment to such agreement that will be effective upon the
completion of the offering and, among other things, will permit such redemptions
and prepayment to be completed.

In addition to repayment of the outstanding $38.3 million principal amount, the
redemption of the 16% senior notes will require payment of a $3.7 million
premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of redemption.
Affiliates of Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, one of the representatives of the
underwriters of the offering, hold a substantial majority of the outstanding 16%
senior notes and, as a result, will receive a payment of approximately
$38.2 million, representing principal and premium, in connection with the
redemption of their notes, together with accrued but unpaid interest through the
date of redemption. The redemption of $70.0 million in aggregate principal
amount or our 9 3/4% senior notes due 2010 will require payment of a $6.8
million premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of
redemption. The prepayment of $16.9 million in principal amount of our term loan
also will require payment of any accrued but unpaid interest through the date of
prepayment. Affiliates of Credit Suisse First Boston LLC are the lenders with
respect to 3.71% of this term loan.

Our 9 3/4% senior notes due 2010 were issued by our indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary, CBRE Escrow, Inc., on May 22, 2003, with the proceeds from the
offering of these notes being placed in escrow pending our acquisition of
Insignia. On July 23, 2003, CBRE Escrow merged into our direct, wholly owned
subsidiary CB Richard Ellis Services, Inc., and the net proceeds from the
offering were released from escrow and used to partially finance our acquisition
of Insignia.

The term loan that we will partially prepay with net proceeds we receive from
the offering will be a portion of the term loan under our current amended and
restated credit agreement, which will be refinanced in connection with the
completion of the offering. Pursuant to the terms of the new amended and
restated credit agreement that will become effective with such refinancing, the
term loan will bear interest at varying rates based, at our option, at either
LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.50% or the alternate base rate plus 1.25% to 1.50% (in
each case determined by reference to the credit rating assigned to the term
facility by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s). The alternate
base rate is the higher of (1) Credit Suisse First Boston’s prime rate or (2)
the effective rate for federal funds plus 0.50%. A portion of the outstanding
term loan under our current amended and restated credit agreement was borrowed
during the past year in order to finance partially our acquisition of Insignia
on July 23, 2003 and for other general corporate purposes."

offering in research and development activities, including by hiring personnel
with technical design skills, creating additional Power-over-Ethernet products,
developing new products in the area of power management delivery and control
and/or acquiring additional technical design capabilities, and approximately $12
million in expanding sales and marketing efforts. We intend to use the remainder
of the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. We also may
use a portion of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in, or
acquisitions of, complementary businesses, products or technologies. We have no

acquisition. Pending their ultimate use, we intend to invest the net proceeds to

price of $7.00 per share, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and our estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional shares of common stock in full to cover
over-allotments, we estimate our aggregate net proceeds will be approximately
$35.9 million.

We expect to use approximately $22.0 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to advance the clinical development of both Veronate and Aurexis. In
particular, we anticipate using these amounts to fund the direct costs of the
following:

     •  approximately $20.0 million to complete approximately 75-80% of the     
        enrollment in a 2,000-patient pivotal Phase III clinical trial for      
        Veronate;                                                               
    
     •  approximately $2.0 million to complete the Phase II clinical trial for  
        Aurexis that we initiated in February 2004 and the initiation of at     
        least one additional clinical trial for Aurexis, which we anticipate    
        could begin during the first half of 2005.                              


We believe we will need to raise additional funds before we can expect to
advance Veronate through the regulatory review and approval process and
commercialization and complete a Phase III clinical trial for Aurexis.

We anticipate using the remaining net proceeds of this offering, together with
our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, to further
develop our existing preclinical product candidates, to expand our research and
development capabilities, and for working capital and general corporate purposes
including salaries, rent and professional fees.

The amount and timing of our use of these proceeds will depend on a number of
factors, including the status of our development and commercialization efforts,
the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering and the amount of
proceeds generated, if any, by entering into future partnerships or
collaborations with third-parties. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for
the acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies or assets that
complement our technology or business strategy. However, we have no present
understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any potential
acquisitions or investments at this time. We will have broad discretion to
determine the ultimate use of the net proceeds from this offering, which may
differ substantially from the estimated uses outlined above.

We intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering, pending their use, in
short-term and medium-term interest-bearing, investment grade securities, money

approximately $114.5 million, or approximately $132.1 million if the
underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, after deducting
assumed underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

                  approximately $33.2 million to repay the
                  debt outstanding under our credit       
                  facility with Morgan Stanley, including 
                  debt incurred to finance our recent     
                  acquisition of additional wireless      
                  communications towers located in        
                  Georgia, which matures October 1, 2005  
                  and bears interest, at our option, at   
                  either the federal funds rate plus      
                  2.1175% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.5% per
                  annum. On May 17, 2004, the interest    
                  rate on our credit facility was 3.6%. We
                  use borrowings under the credit facility
                  primarily to fund acquisitions, from    
                  time to time, of additional wireless    
                  communications towers and other         
                  communications sites;                   


                    
                  approximately $53.0 million to finance  
                  the acquisition of Tower Ventures. We   
                  expect to finance this acquisition with 
                  a portion of the net proceeds from this 
                  offering. If the offering is not        
                  completed prior to the closing of the   
                  acquisition, we expect to finance this  
                  acquisition with short-term borrowings  
                  under our credit facility which we then 
                  expect to repay upon consummation of    
                  this offering;                          


                       
                  approximately $2.1 million to finance   
                  the acquisition of the land we currently
                  lease underneath      of our sites in a 
                  series of transactions for which asset  
                  purchase agreements have been signed;   


                       
                  approximately $3.8 million to pay for   
                  the cost of licensing and implementing  
                  PeopleSoft, Cognos and manageStar       
                  software systems;                       


                      
                  approximately $1.2 million to finance   
                  our acquisition of the 9% minority      
                  interest of the capital stock of        
                  Pinnacle Towers Limited, our UK         
                  subsidiary, and, upon consummation of   
                  that acquisition, approximately $1.0    
                  million (based on an exchange rate of 1 
                  GBP = 1.7692 USD on May 17, 2004) to    
                  repay outstanding borrowings under our  
                  UK term loan with Bank of Scotland which
                  matures June 30, 2006, and bears        
                  interest at 2% above a base rate. On May
                  17, 2004, the interest rate on that term
                  loan was 5.8%. The proceeds of the term 
                  loan were used to fund the              
                  communications sites owned by Pinnacle  
                  Towers Limited; and                     

                     
                  approximately $20.2 million to finance  
                  the acquisition of 56 communications    
                  sites located in Alabama, Arkansas,     
                  Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas,  
                  Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts,     
                  Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,       
                  Missouri, South Carolina, Texas and     
                  Wisconsin for which we have currently   
                  signed non-binding letters of intent. We
                  are seeking to complete our due         
                  diligence and execute firm asset        
                  purchase agreements for these sites."
