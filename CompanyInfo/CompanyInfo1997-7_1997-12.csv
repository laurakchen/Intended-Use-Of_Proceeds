Stock and the 1,300,000 Warrants offered hereby, after deduction of 
underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated Offering expenses 
will be approximately $5,267,000 ($6,162,050 if the Underwriters' Over-
allotment Option is exercised in full). The Company anticipates that the net 
proceeds from the Offering will be used approximately as follows: (i) 
$2,200,000 to complete production of the next 12 episodes of the Kanga Roddy 
Series, (ii) $445,500 to repay debt, (iii) $50,000 to pay Joe and Jennifer 
Montana for services relating to the ""MONTANA EXERCISE VIDEO,"" and (iv) the 
remainder to be used for working capital purposes, including the funding of the 
Rescission Offer (which, if every holder to whom the Rescission Offer is made 
accepts such Rescission Offer would cost the Company approximately $1,175,520, 
excluding interest), the hiring of additional management personnel, relocation 
of the Company's headquarters and other general corporate purposes. See 
""Capitalization,"" ""Business,"" ""Certain Transactions"" and ""Rescission Offer."" 
The $445,500 of debt to be repaid consists of (i) $345,000 owed to 8 
stockholders of the Company which bears interest at 15% per annum and is due 
and payable on the earlier of three days after the Company receives the net 
proceeds of the Offering or July 1, 1997, (ii) approximately $48,000 owed to 
the Michael Triantos M.D. Inc. Money Purchase and Profit Sharing Plans Trust 
which bears interest at 12% per annum and is due and payable on the earlier of 
consummation of the Offering or December 15, 1999 and 
(iii) approximately $52,500 to be paid to George Chung for Mr. Chung's use of 
personal funds to repay the Company's two bank loans from Silicon Valley Bank 
and Bank of Canton in the aggregate principal amount outstanding of $52,500. 
Other than the $52,500 to be repaid to Mr. Chung as described in (iii) above, 
no portion of the $445,000 of debt to be repaid is to an affiliate of the 
Company. However, approximately $48,000 of debt bearing interest at 12% per 
annum to be repaid to a third party is personally guaranteed by Anthony Chan

(1) It is presently anticipated that the balance of the proceeds attributable to
    working capital will be used to fund current operations through calendar
    1997, at which time the Company anticipates being able to generate positive
    cash flow from operations. These proceeds can also be used by the Company
    for future unspecified acquisitions, even though the Company has no present
    intention to make any such acquisition. See ""Business"" and ""Management's
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.""

(2) Includes the repayment of various promissory notes with interest accrued to
    March 31, 1997 and certain accounts payable as follows: (i) $595,795 for
    open accounts payable, including payments to present product manufacturer;
    (ii) $264,804 to Steven A. Cantor, the Company's largest stockholder
    including interest at 8% per annum; (iii) $133,951 to holders of Second
    Private Placement Notes including interest at 12% per annum; (iv) $6,772 in
    payment of interest on the Convertible Notes; (v) $594,163 to a product
    manufacturer including interest at 9.25% per annum; (vi) $140,749 to a
    product manufacturer including interest at 10% per annum; (vii) $15,805 to a
    product manufacturer including interest at 8% per annum; (viii) $27,939 to a
    product advertiser including interest at 10%; (ix) salaries to a former
    employee of $12,500 accrued through March 31, 1997; and (x) $25,208 in
    payment of a short-term loan received in March 1997; (xi) $150,000 in
    payment of three interim loans received in May and June 1997; and (xii)
    $50,000 in payment of an interim demand loan received during May 1997. See
    ""Certain Transactions.""

     The amounts set forth above, other than for repayment of indebtedness are
estimates. The actual amount expended to finance any category of expenses may be
increased or decreased by the Company's Board of Directors, in its discretion,
if required by the operating experience of the Company or if a reapportionment
or redirection of funds, including acquisitions consistent with the business
strategy of the Company, is deemed to be in the best interest of the Company.
The Company has no specific plans, arrangements, understandings or commitments
with respect to any such acquisition at the present time. See ""Risk
Factors -- Discretion in Application of Proceeds.""

     All proceeds of debt incurred by the Company during the one year period
prior to the date of this Prospectus (approximately $1,189,000), were used for
working capital purposes, including payment of then existing trade payables.
Approximately $683,000 of this indebtedness will be paid from these proceeds.

     The net proceeds to the Company from this offering are expected to be
adequate to fund the Company's working capital needs for at least the next
twelve (12) months. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."" Pending
use of the proceeds from this offering as set forth above, the Company may
invest all or a portion of such proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing
securities, U.S. Government securities, money market investments and short-term,
interest-bearing deposits in major banks."

Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately $32.7 
million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and 
offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company will not receive any of 
the proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Shareholders. See 
""Principal and Selling Shareholders."" 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase the Company's equity 
capital, to create a public market for the Common Stock and to facilitate 
future access by the Company to public equity markets. The Company intends to 
use approximately $7.7 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay in 
full the outstanding indebtedness under the Loan and Security Agreement dated 
October 26, 1995, as amended (the ""Loan and Security Agreement""), between the 
Company and People's Bank (the ""Bank""). The Loan and Security Agreement 
provides for a $6.0 million line of credit (the ""Line of Credit"") and a $2.5 
million Term Note (the ""Term Note""). The Line of Credit expires on February 1, 
1998 and bears interest at a floating rate which was 9.25% per annum at March 
31, 1997. The Term Note is payable in monthly principal installments through 
October 2002. The Term Note bears interest at 11.0% payable on a current basis 
and accrues additional interest based upon a formula which approximates 9.0%. 
The outstanding principal balances of the Term Note and the Line of Credit, 
together with accrued interest thereon, are required to be paid in full upon 
consummation of the offering. The Company, however, will be permitted to 
continue to borrow amounts under the Line of Credit through February 1, 1998. 
In addition, the Company intends to use $250,000 of the net proceeds of the 
offering to repay in full a note bearing an interest rate of 12.0% payable to 
Wand/IMA Investments, L.P., dated December 21, 1990, as amended (the ""Wand 
Note""). 

The Company expects to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes. A portion of the net 
proceeds may also be used for the acquisition of businesses, products and 
technologies that are complementary to those of the Company. While the Company 
engages from time to time in discussions with respect to potential 
acquisitions, the Company has no plans, commitments or agreements with respect 
to any such acquisitions as of the date of this Prospectus. The Company has not 
as yet identified specific uses for such proceeds and will have discretion over 
their use and investment. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest the 
net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-
bearing instruments. See ""Risk Factors--Discretion as to Use of Proceeds."""

(1) Includes the purchase of existing video content from third parties that can 
be incorporated into the HotelView 7 Library as well as other libraries the 
Company intends to develop. Also includes the acquisition of the necessary 
technology in areas such as communications, marketing and transaction 
processing to enable the Company to do business on the Internet. While the 
Company has had initial conversations with a number of companies with such 
content, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreements to purchase 
these libraries. No portion of the proceeds from this Offering will be used to 
satisfy the purchase price of the software products as contemplated by the 
Company from Digital Criteria Search Technologies, Inc. (""DCST""). See ""Business.
"" 
(2) The Company is currently searching for a location to construct additional 
editing facilities in Palm Beach or Broward County, Florida. The Company 
intends to use a portion of these proceeds to finance the purchase of 
additional equipment for video editing, graphic design and other production 
services. The funds allocated will be used for down payments for potential real 
estate acquisition, down payment for such editing equipment as well as for the 
purchase of certain other equipment and software. See ""Business--Filming and 
Production."" 
(3) Includes approximately 400 additional hardware systems for use by travel 
agents in order to display the HotelView/registered trademark/ Library and copy 
vignettes for a client. Each of these systems includes (1) a laser disc player, 
and (2) a combination television/VCR and a set of library disks. See 
""Business--The Company's Products and Services--The HotelView/registered 
trademark/ Library."" 
(4) Includes deposits towards the purchase of file server hardware (computer), 
software, sufficient disk storage for digitized video files, and communications 
hardware for linking the file server to the Internet and directly to marketing 
partners' file servers. 
(5) Includes national consumer advertising, advertising in trade publications, 
attendance at and participation in trade shows. Although the Company currently 
anticipates that a substantial portion of these funds will be allocated to the 
marketing and advertising of the HotelView/registered trademark/ Library, some 
of these funds may be used in the future for the marketing and advertising of 
other libraries, as they become available. 
(6) Includes the hiring of a Chief Financial Officer, a General Manager for the 
Company's Internet systems, and approximately eight additional employees. It is 
estimated that these proceeds will be sufficient to pay the compensation and 
benefits for at least one year from the date of hiring such personnel. 
(7) Represents payment in full of outstanding unsecured promissory notes in the 
aggregate principal amount of $850,000, bearing interest at 10% per annum, 
issued by the Company to unaffiliated third parties between December 1996 and 
June 1997 which are due upon the earlier of 30 days from the date of this 
Prospectus or 12 months from the date of the note as well as a $15,000 
promissory note to an unaffiliated third party dated March 5, 1996, bearing 
interest at 6% per annum, which is due the earlier of June 30, 1997 or 30 days 
from the date of this Prospectus. The aggregate of such funds were used by the 
Company for general working capital purposes. See Note 4 to the Financial 
Statements. 
(8) Includes in-house production and costs for independent camera crews, 
overhead expenses, and compensation and benefits for existing employees for at 
least one year from the date of this offering as well as the $61,000 consulting 
fee payable to the Representative. See ""Underwriting."" 
The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of the 
net proceeds of the offering, based upon the current status of its operations 
and anticipated business plans. It is possible, however, that the application 
of funds may vary depending on numerous factors including, but not limited to, 
changes in the economic climate or unanticipated complications, delay and 
expenses. The Company currently estimates that the net proceeds from this 
offering will be sufficient to meet the Company's liquidity and working capital 
requirements for a period of at least 24 months from the completion of this 
offering. However, there can be no assurance that the net proceeds of this 
offering will satisfy the Company's requirements for any particular period of 
time. Additional financing may be required to implement the Company's long-term 
business plan. There can be no assurance that any such additional financing 
will be available when needed on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. 
Pending the foregoing uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested 
in short-term, investment grade, interest bearing securities. See ""Management's

(1) Includes the purchase of existing video content from third parties that can 
be incorporated into the HotelView 7 Library as well as other libraries the 
Company intends to develop. Also includes the acquisition of the necessary 
technology in areas such as communications, marketing and transaction 
processing to enable the Company to do business on the Internet. While the 
Company has had initial conversations with a number of companies with such 
content, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreements to purchase 
these libraries. No portion of the proceeds from this Offering will be used to 
satisfy the purchase price of the software products as contemplated by the 
Company from Digital Criteria Search Technologies, Inc. (""DCST""). See ""Business.
"" 
(2) The Company is currently searching for a location to construct additional 
editing facilities in Palm Beach or Broward County, Florida. The Company 
intends to use a portion of these proceeds to finance the purchase of 
additional equipment for video editing, graphic design and other production 
services. The funds allocated will be used for down payments for potential real 
estate acquisition, down payment for such editing equipment as well as for the 
purchase of certain other equipment and software. See ""Business--Filming and 
Production."" 
(3) Includes approximately 400 additional hardware systems for use by travel 
agents in order to display the HotelView/registered trademark/ Library and copy 
vignettes for a client. Each of these systems includes (1) a laser disc player, 
and (2) a combination television/VCR and a set of library disks. See 
""Business--The Company's Products and Services--The HotelView/registered 
trademark/ Library."" 
(4) Includes deposits towards the purchase of file server hardware (computer), 
software, sufficient disk storage for digitized video files, and communications 
hardware for linking the file server to the Internet and directly to marketing 
partners' file servers. 
(5) Includes national consumer advertising, advertising in trade publications, 
attendance at and participation in trade shows. Although the Company currently 
anticipates that a substantial portion of these funds will be allocated to the 
marketing and advertising of the HotelView/registered trademark/ Library, some 
of these funds may be used in the future for the marketing and advertising of 
other libraries, as they become available. 
(6) Includes the hiring of a Chief Financial Officer, a General Manager for the 
Company's Internet systems, and approximately eight additional employees. It is 
estimated that these proceeds will be sufficient to pay the compensation and 
benefits for at least one year from the date of hiring such personnel. 
(7) Represents payment in full of outstanding unsecured promissory notes in the 
aggregate principal amount of $850,000, bearing interest at 10% per annum, 
issued by the Company to unaffiliated third parties between December 1996 and 
June 1997 which are due upon the earlier of 30 days from the date of this 
Prospectus or 12 months from the date of the note as well as a $15,000 
promissory note to an unaffiliated third party dated March 5, 1996, bearing 
interest at 6% per annum, which is due the earlier of June 30, 1997 or 30 days 
from the date of this Prospectus. The aggregate of such funds were used by the 
Company for general working capital purposes. See Note 4 to the Financial 
Statements. 
(8) Includes in-house production and costs for independent camera crews, 
overhead expenses, and compensation and benefits for existing employees for at 
least one year from the date of this offering as well as the $61,000 consulting 
fee payable to the Representative. See ""Underwriting."" 
The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of the 
net proceeds of the offering, based upon the current status of its operations 
and anticipated business plans. It is possible, however, that the application 
of funds may vary depending on numerous factors including, but not limited to, 
changes in the economic climate or unanticipated complications, delay and 
expenses. The Company currently estimates that the net proceeds from this 
offering will be sufficient to meet the Company's liquidity and working capital 
requirements for a period of at least 24 months from the completion of this 
offering. However, there can be no assurance that the net proceeds of this 
offering will satisfy the Company's requirements for any particular period of 
time. Additional financing may be required to implement the Company's long-term 
business plan. There can be no assurance that any such additional financing 
will be available when needed on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. 
Pending the foregoing uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested 
in short-term, investment grade, interest bearing securities. See ""Management's

after deduction of the underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses 
payable by the Company, are approximately $43.5 million ($50.5 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of this amount, 
approximately $18.4 million will be used to pay the cash portion of the 
purchase prices for the Acquisitions and $14.3 million will be used to repay 
outstanding indebtedness as well as certain other obligations incurred in 
connection with the Consolidation (including $11.7 million of indebtedness of 
the Founding Companies and $739,000 of indebtedness of Vestcom pursuant to 
certain promissory notes which were issued in connection with Vestcom's 
organization). Additionally, up to $2.8 million in cash may be used to pay 
deferred purchase prices which may be earned over the next one to two years if 
the applicable revenue and earnings thresholds of four of the Founding 
Companies are achieved. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

Of the $11.7 million of indebtedness of the Founding Companies, approximately 
$10.0 million was incurred after March 31, 1996 for purposes other than working 
capital. Of such amount, approximately $9.4 million was incurred for fixed 
asset purchases or capital leases, and approximately $628,000 was incurred in 
connection with the acquisitions of two businesses by DMS for a purchase price 
of approximately $662,000. 

The indebtedness evidenced by Vestcom's promissory notes bears interest at a 
rate equal to the prime rate, as such prime rate may change from time to time. 
The borrowed funds were used to pay organizational and pre-operating expenses. 
The other indebtedness to be repaid from the proceeds of the Offering bears 
interest at rates ranging from 4.8% to 15.0%. Such indebtedness matures at 
various dates through 2003. 

The remaining net proceeds of the Offering, approximately $12.6 million, will 
be used for general corporate purposes, which are expected to include future 
acquisitions. The Company currently has no agreement or understanding with 
respect to any future acquisitions. Pending the use of the net proceeds for 
such purposes, the Company will invest such net proceeds in short-term, 
investment grade interest bearing securities. 

The Company has received a commitment letter from a bank for a $30 million 
unsecured credit facility (which includes a $5 million line to be used solely 
for equipment financing). Any financing pursuant to the commitment letter is 
subject to internal bank approvals, negotiation of a binding loan agreement,

The capital contributed to the Bank will constitute common equity capital of 
the Bank for regulatory capital purposes and will be used for general corporate 
purposes. The Bank's use of the portion of the net proceeds of the Offering 
contributed as capital to the Bank will be subject to lending and investment 
regulations promulgated by the OTS and the Home Owners' Loan Act. These 
regulations specify the percentage of the Bank's assets that may be used for 
various lending and investment activities and require the Bank to maintain 
standards that are consistent with safety and soundness and are appropriate for 
its size and condition, the nature and scope of its operations and general 
market conditions. The OTS will regularly conduct extensive examinations of the 
Bank's investment portfolio and lending activities to ensure compliance with 
applicable regulations and safety and soundness criteria. The portion of the 
net proceeds of the Offering to be paid to TSJ&A will be used to reimburse 
TSJ&A for expenses incurred for management consulting, regulatory and 
accounting services, as well as office space and clerical support, during the 
Bank's organization and its ongoing operations prior to the Reorganization. See

proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock are estimated to be approximately 
$184.4 million (after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated 
expenses of the Offerings). The Company plans to use $60.0 million to purchase 
all of the PCI Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock held by 
certain of the Principal Stockholders, approximately $1.23 million for the 
payment of bonuses to certain executives of the Company and substantially all 
of the remaining net proceeds to finance the commencement and development of 
its D-DTH business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to 
successfully enter the D-DTH market. See ""Risk Factors -- Risks Related to the 
Company -- Limited D-DTH Experience and Uncertainties Associated with the D-DTH 
Market"" and ""Risk Factors -- Risks Related to the Company -- Benefits of the 
Offerings to Insiders"". The Company intends to use any remaining net proceeds 
for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, development of 
its cable television and programming businesses and future acquisitions. The 
Company believes that it has sufficient net proceeds from the sale of the Notes 
to consummate the Acquisitions and does not intend to use any of the net 
proceeds from the Offerings for such purpose. Because of the number and 
variability of factors that will determine the Company's use of proceeds from 
the Offerings, management will retain a significant amount of discretion over 
the application of the net proceeds. Pending utilization of the net proceeds of 
the Offerings, the Company intends to invest such proceeds in short-term 
investment grade securities. 

The Company expects that an aggregate of approximately $315 million in 1997 and 
1998 will be required to fund (i) the commencement and development of its D-DTH 
business, which will include capital expenditures and expenditures for 
operating expenses, working capital and other general corporate purposes 
(approximately $200 million, including up to approximately $190 million to 
subsidize the cost of D-DTH Reception Systems to the Initial Subscribers in an 
amount of up to approximately $380 per subscriber), (ii) the expansion of its 
programming business (approximately $25 million), (iii) the consummation of the 
Acquisitions and future acquisitions (approximately $60 million) and (iv) the 
building out and rebuilding of its cable television networks (approximately 
$30 million). The Company believes that, in addition to the net proceeds from 
the Offerings, remaining funds from the offering of the Notes and cash from 
operations, it will need additional funding of approximately $100 million to 
fulfill its current business development plans through the end of 1998. There 
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to borrow funds under any 
credit facilities or that suitable debt or equity financing will be available 
to the Company or, if available, that the terms thereof will be attractive to 
the Company. However, the pace and amount of the Company's expenditures for its 
business development plans are largely discretionary. See ""Risk Factors --

deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by the Company. The Company will not receive any of the 
proceeds from the sale of the 297,986 shares of Common Stock offered by the 
Selling Stockholder. During the next two years, the Company intends to spend 
between $5.5 million and $8.0 million on laboratory equipment and between $1.0 
million and $1.5 million on information systems. These expenditures primarily 
will supplement and expand capabilities for existing services offered to 
clients. In addition, the Company intends to extend its BioTesting capacity in 
the United States, Scotland and Germany through expansion of existing 
facilities and lease and build out of new facilities and to expand its viral 
manufacturing capacity. The Company anticipates that these expansions will 
require cash outlays between $2.0 million and $3.0 million, depending on the 
amount of build out required for new facilities. The Company also intends to 
pursue further expansion of its viral manufacturing capabilities through the 
construction, purchase or lease of additional facilities. At the present time, 
the Company is not able to estimate the amount required for this purpose. The 
Company will use the remainder of the proceeds for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions. Pending such uses,
 the Company intends to invest the net proceeds from the Offering in short-term 
United States government securities. 

As part of its business strategy, the Company reviews many acquisition 
candidates in the ordinary course of business, although the Company has no

 this Offering are to increase the Company's equity capital, to create a public

 markets. 
The Company intends to use the net proceeds, including the interest thereon, of
 this Offering for general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing and

of complementary businesses, products or technologies. There are at present no 
arrangements or agreements for any such acquisitions. 
The Company believes that the combination of the net proceeds of this Offering,
 existing sources of liquidity and internally generated cash, if any, will be

exercised in full), after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated 
offering expenses. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
shares of Class A Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders hereunder. 
See ""Principal and Selling Stockholders"". 

The Company will use a portion of the net proceeds from the Offerings to repay 
the outstanding balance under its revolving credit agreement. As of March 31, 
1997, the outstanding balance under the revolving credit agreement was $34.3 
million and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 6%. Borrowings 
under the revolving credit agreement have been used to fund working capital 
requirements and to pay dividends representing prior earnings to the Company's 
current stockholders. 

The Company elected to be treated as an S corporation beginning January 1, 1987 
and, therefore, the income of the Company is attributable to its current 
stockholders for federal and certain state and local tax purposes. 
Upon consummation of the Offerings, the Company will terminate its S corporation
election and will become subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes 
at prevailing corporate rates. In connection with the termination of the 
Company's S corporation election, the Company will pay to its current 
stockholders a distribution (the ""S Corporation Distribution""), which was 
declared, but not paid, prior to the Offerings. The S Corporation Distribution 
will be equal to the amount of the Company's earnings which are taxable to its 
current stockholders and have not been previously distributed to them. The S 
Corporation Distribution will consist of undistributed earnings for the year 
ended December 31, 1996 and a proportional share of the Company's entire 1997 
earnings (based on the number of days in the period) for the period beginning 
January 1, 1997 and ending on the date that the Company's S corporation election
is terminated. The Company currently estimates that the S Corporation 
Distribution will be approximately $38 million, a significant portion of which 
will be used by the stockholders of the Company to pay taxes they will owe on 
the Company's income attributable to them as stockholders of an S corporation.
The actual amount of the S Corporation Distribution will be based on the date 
of termination of the Company's S corporation election and actual 1997 earnings.
The Company will use $26 million of the net proceeds of the Offerings to pay a 
portion of the S Corporation Distribution upon consummation of the Offerings 
and, once the actual S Corporation Distribution is determined, the Company will 
use cash on hand to fund the balance of the S Corporation Distribution. 
Purchasers of shares of Class A Common Stock in the Offerings will not be 
entitled to any portion of the S Corporation Distribution.

other general corporate purposes."

hereby are estimated to be approximately $27.6 million ($31.8 million, assuming 
the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) after deducting 
the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
payable by the Company. 

The net proceeds of this offering are estimated to be used by the Company to 
fund the following development stage operating costs and expenses and 
investment in property and equipment: $9.8 million for research and development 
(including pre-production manufacturing and completion of the design, 
engineering and testing of the Super X); $2.0 million for sales and marketing 
(including increased marketing activity prior to the commercial introduction of 
the Super X and dealer network development); $13.4 million for capital 
expenditures (including completing and equipping the manufacturing and 
administrative facility and acquiring manufacturing tooling); and $2.4 million 
for general and administrative costs. Pending such uses, the Company intends to 
invest such net proceeds from this offering in short-term investment-grade, 
interest-bearing securities. In addition, the Company may also require 
additional fixed asset and working capital financing prior to commencement of 
production of the Super X.* Upon commencement of production, the Company will 
need to obtain substantial amounts of fixed asset and working capital financing.

is exercised in full). 

The Company currently intends to utilize the net proceeds to be received by it 
from the Offering to fund a portion of its anticipated capital requirements 
over the next 12 to 18 months of between $50 million and $65 million, including 
(i) approximately $29 million to construct and equip its new shipyard, (ii) 
approximately $3 million for capital expenditures to increase the productive 
capacity and efficiency of its existing shipyard, (iii) approximately $3 
million for research and development expenditures related to the design of new, 
technologically innovative offshore drilling rigs and floating production 
units, (iv) between $10 million and $20 million of additional working capital 
related to increased levels of conversion, retrofit and repair activities and 
new construction of offshore drilling rigs and floating production units and 
(v) $5 million to $10 million for general corporate purposes, which may include 
the establishment of a manufacturing operation, either at the Company's 
shipyards or at another location, that would be capable of constructing and 
assembling components of new-build jackups or the acquisition of one or more 
businesses that are complementary to the Company's operations. 

The Company is currently exploring opportunities for acquiring additional 
shipyard capacity, either in the United States, Canada or Mexico, at which the 
Company could construct and assemble new-build jackup rig components, such as 
the rack chock system and the jacking components. Although the Company is 
investigating several opportunities to acquire additional shipyard capacity for 
this purpose, it does not have any agreements or understandings with respect to 
any acquisition, and there can be no assurances that the Company will be 
successful in acquiring such additional capacity on terms satisfactory to the 
Company. The Company is not currently pursuing any other acquisition 
opportunities but may do so in the future. 

The Company would expect to fund the remaining portion of its anticipated 
capital requirements from cash flow from operations, borrowings available under 
its existing revolving credit facility or additional borrowings. As an 
additional source of borrowing capacity, the Company has received a commitment 
letter from the United States Maritime Administration (""MARAD"") specifying 
that, subject to the completion of documentation and the satisfaction of 
certain other conditions, MARAD would provide its guarantee, supported by the 
full faith and credit of the United States, for up to $24.8 million of bonds to 
be issued by the Company. The proceeds from the sale of any MARAD- guaranteed 
bonds may be used only for capital expenditures relating to the costs of 
constructing and equipping the Company's new shipyard. The terms of the MARAD 
financing permit the Company to issue and sell bonds in increments. Due to the 
generally favorable interest rates and payment terms of MARAD financing, the 
Company anticipates that it would sell bonds under the MARAD financing 
arrangement in increments as capital expenditures are incurred with respect to 
the new shipyard. Any funds obtained from the MARAD financing would result in 
the availability of other sources of capital, including proceeds from the 
Offering, cash from operations and other borrowings, for use to satisfy the 
Company's other capital requirements described above. There can be no assurance
 that the Company will sell any MARAD- guaranteed bonds. See ""Management's

The Company has entered into a letter of intent to acquire the concession 
rights from the existing franchise at the Denver International Airport. Those 
rights include an operating concession, one improved but nonoperating concession, 
and the right to construct and operate two additional locations at the Denver 
International Airport. The funds allocated to this acquisition represent the 
cash portion of the purchase price. In addition, the Company has entered into 
an oral agreement to acquire certain assets and contract rights from an 
existing concessionaire at the Sioux Falls Airport. The funds allocated to this 
acquisition represent the full purchase price for the assets and contract rights. 
If either of these transactions are not consummated, the amounts allocated will 
be transferred to a construction and acquisition reserve established by the 
Company. See ""CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS."" 

The amounts allocated to capital improvements at Allentown, Columbia, Cedar 
Rapids and Denver comprise all of the funds necessary to complete improvements 
for concessions at those airports. 

The Company redeemed 33% of the 8% Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, at 
ninety percent of the public offering price of the Common Stock. The figure set 
forth above includes redemption of an aggregate of 264,000 shares. 

The Company obtained a $220,000 SBA loan in September 1992. The SBA loan is 
payable in monthly installments of $2,770 and matures in October 2002. The loan 
agreement for the SBA loan provides that the Company will not redeem securities 
or issue any dividends without the lender's prior consent. The Company did not 
secure the lender's consent to the redemption of the 9% Redeemable Convertible 
Preferred Stock and 8% Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result, the lender may 
call the SBA loan prior to its maturity. If the lender does not call the loan, 
the funds reserved for repayment will be added to working capital. 

The balance of the proceeds from this offering will be used for working capital 
purposes. A substantial portion of the working capital is expected to be applied 
to engineering and architectural fees in connection with the construction of 
capital improvements at the Company's concession facilities located at the 
Sioux Falls, JFK and Des Moines airports. 
Pending use of the net proceeds for the purposes set forth above, the Company 
intends to invest such funds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade 
obligations. The amounts set forth above represent the Company's present 
intentions for the use of the proceeds from this offering. Actual expenditures 
could vary considerably depending upon many factors, including, without 
limitation, changes in economic conditions, unanticipated complications, delays 
and expenses, or the availability of alternative financing. Any reallocation of 
net proceeds of this offering will be made at the discretion of the Board of 
Directors but will be in furtherance of the Company's strategy as described in 
this Prospectus."

by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately $16,852,000 
(approximately $19,489,000 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full). The Company expects to use approximately $10.8 million of 
such net proceeds to repay indebtedness and the balance will be used for 
general corporate purposes, primarily to finance the development and expansion 
of additional entertainment restaurant locations. Such indebtedness was 
principally incurred to fund the purchase by the Company from certain 
stockholders of their general and limited partnership interests in the 
Subsidiary Limited Partnerships, certain distributions of undistributed S 
corporation earnings to the then-existing Bailey's stockholders prior to the 
Exchange and to purchase leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment. A 
majority of such indebtedness was incurred by the Company within the past year. 
All of such indebtedness accrues interest at the prime rate (currently 8.50% 
per annum) and matures on August 1, 1997. One-half of such indebtedness has 
been guaranteed by a principal stockholder of the Company. See ""Certain 
Transactions."" Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this Offering will be 
invested in short-term, interest-bearing securities. 

A portion of such net proceeds may also be used to acquire one or more 
companies in the entertainment restaurant business or certain of their 
locations. However, the Company has not entered into any agreements and is not 
involved in any negotiations involving potential acquisitions. 

The initial allocation of the net proceeds of this Offering set forth above 
represents the Company's best estimate based upon its present plans and certain 
assumptions regarding general economic and industry conditions and the 
Company's future revenues and expenditures. The Company reserves the right to 
reallocate these proceeds within the above-mentioned categories or to other 
purposes in response to, among other things, changes in its plans, industry or 
general economic conditions and the Company's future revenues and expenditures. 

Any additional net proceeds realized from the exercise of the Underwriters' 
over-allotment option (up to approximately $2,637,000) will be added to the 
Company's working capital."

the net proceeds as follows: (i) approximately $18.2 million will be used to 
repay a portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness under the Credit 
Facility, including accrued and unpaid interest; (ii) $8.0 million will be used 
to redeem all of the outstanding Redeemable Preferred Stock; and (iii) the 
balance of approximately $6.1 million will be used for working capital and 
other general corporate purposes. Pending such use, the balance of the net 
proceeds will be invested in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing 
obligations. 

The Credit Facility expires on August 29, 1999. Amounts outstanding under the 
Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates which are based upon either the 
lender's base rate or LIBOR, plus in either case a margin which varies 
according to the ratio of the Company's funded debt to Adjusted EBITDA, each as 
defined in the Credit Facility. The interest rate on such indebtedness at March 
31, 1997 was 8.9% per annum. At May 31, 1997, the Company had outstanding 
borrowings of $24.8 million under the Credit Facility. The Company incurred 
$17.4 million, $5.0 million, $495,000, $1.6 million and $2.8 million of 
indebtedness under the Credit Facility to finance the 1996 Transactions and the 
acquisitions of Midwest, Convenient, Arkansas Dental Health and United, 
respectively. The Company expects to incur additional indebtedness of 
approximately $1.8 million to finance the acquisition of Indiana Dental. All 
outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility was used to finance such 
acquisitions. See ""The Company,"" ""Capitalization"" and ""Management's Discussion

The Company intends to use approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds to 
reduce borrowings under a revolving line of credit, the proceeds of which were 
used to repay outstanding notes payable and for general corporate purposes, 
including capital investments in the Company's subsidiary banks to fund 
anticipated growth and expansion. The revolving line of credit provides for
 maximum outstanding amounts of up to $5.0 million, is secured by 80% of the

21, 2007. Interest accrues on outstanding borrowings under the revolving line

description of the Company's credit facility, including the revolving line of 
credit, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

the exercise of the over-allotment option. 

The Company will use the net proceeds to repay the full amount of the 
indebtedness outstanding under promissory notes issued to Dai-ichi (the 
""Dai- ichi Notes""). Any remaining proceeds will be used to repay the 
indebtedness outstanding under the Company's long-term credit facility (the 
""Long-Term Facility"") and for general corporate purposes. The Dai-ichi Notes 
consist of approximately $6.2 million principal amount of Class A Notes and 
$31.0 million principal amount of Class B Notes, each bearing interest at 10.0%,

due in two equal installments on June 30, 1997 and 1998. Principal payments on 
the Class B Notes are due in 10 equal installments on June 30th of each year

31, 1997, the principal amount of borrowings under the Long-Term Facility was 
approximately $29.2 million, of which approximately $23.3 million is currently

(1) Of the $900,000 to be used for acquisition of inventory, approximately 
$600,000 will be used to acquire additional inventory of Pabst Products. 
Currently, the Company's inventory of such products averages approximately 
seven (7) days' supply. Management believes that normal inventory levels should 
average thirty (30) days' supply. The additional inventory will permit the
 Company to adequately meet anticipated customer demand for Pabst Products. The 
remaining $300,000 will be used to increase inventories of other brands that 
the Company currently distributes. 
(2) Management of the Company intends to complete the acquisition of two (2) to 
four (4) distributors that have previously acquired exclusive rights to 
distribute alcoholic products other than Pabst Products. The Company intends to 
seek the acquisition of distributors with the distribution rights to other 
beverage brands of beer, soda, water, tea, juice and wine coolers. The Company 
has no intention of acquiring any distributors from related entities and does 
not have any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings regarding 
any acquisitions. See ""Use of Proceeds."" The amount allocated to the 
acquisition of such distributors would be utilized, together with other debt or 
equity securities of the Company, to complete such acquisitions. Management is 
not currently negotiating for the acquisition of any such distributors and has 
no plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with respect to such 
acquisitions. The Company does not intend to acquire any wholesaler from 
affiliates of the Company. Moreover, there can be no assurances that the 
Company will complete any such acquisitions. 

(3) Management of the Company plans to utilize approximately $1,000,000 of the 
proceeds of this Offering to acquire exclusive rights to distribute between two 
(2) and four (4) additional brands of alcoholic and/or non-alcoholic products 
in the areas in which it currently distributes Pabst Products. Depending on the 
brand(s) for which it acquires such distribution rights, the Company may be 
required to pay acquisition fees to the prior holder of such distribution 
rights, which it would partially finance out of the proceeds of this Offering. 
Negotiations are in a preliminary stage, and no agreement or letter of intent 
has been executed by the parties. There can be no assurances that the Company 
will be successful in its efforts to successfully complete an agreement with 
such distributor or, even if it is successful, that it will be able to obtain 
the consent of the brewery that produces such products, to such distribution 
arrangement. 

(4) Such amount will be used primarily as compensation for additional sales 
people and to purchase point-of-sale promotional items, such as neon signs, 
""shelf-talkers,"" banners, and other similar promotional items. 

(5) Working capital includes funds for inventory, support of accounts 
receivable and the hiring of additional personnel, and the funding of interim 
quarterly operating losses. 

The foregoing represents the Company's estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of this Offering, based on the current status of its product line, its 
sales expectations, anticipated operating expenses, inventory requirements and 
current marketing plans. If the Company experiences unforeseen delays or cost 
increases or encounters marketing problems, the Company may modify the intended 
utilization of proceeds as necessary to allow it to conserve capital by slowing 
the speed of inventory build-up and delaying other expenditures while 
attempting to resolve such problems. 
The Company anticipates that the proceeds of this Offering, together with 
revenues from operations, will satisfy its cash requirements for at least the 
next twenty-four (24) months. This estimate is based principally upon the 
Company's assumptions of (i) continuing demand for its products, and (ii) its 
ability to meet the supply requirements for customer demand and inventory 
buildup. No assurance can be given that future unforeseen events or 
contingencies will not affect the validity of these assumptions. Any 
significant favorable or unfavorable deviation in the Company's sales 
performance could significantly affect the timing and amount of additional 
financing required. There is no assurance that financing of any kind will be 
available to the Company if required, and if available, that it will be on 
terms acceptable to the Company. 

Any additional net proceeds received upon the exercise of the Class A Warrants 
or any options that may be granted under the Company's 1996 Incentive Stock 
Option Plan will be used for working capital. Pending the use of the proceeds 
of this Offering, the funds will be deposited in interest or non-interest 
bearing accounts, or invested in commercial paper, certificates of deposit, 
governmental securities or similar instruments."

of $1,380,134 will be used for general corporate purposes, including working 
capital. See ""Business--The Reorganization"". Pending such use, the net proceeds

(1) Includes anticipated costs for software in the amount of $325,000 for new 
product lines currently in development (i.e., the CMPR1 (motor protection

(2) Represents anticipated costs associated with advertising and promotion, 
including trade shows and trade publications. 

(3) Represents anticipated costs associated with purchasing equipment, including
computer hardware, engineering and testing equipment. 

(4) Represents payment of consulting fees of approximately $23,000 to Frank J.

executive officers (estimated at $44,200 per month) and fees to Frank Mancini, 
a director, for consulting services ($4,000 per month until September 1, 1997) 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient for such purposes. 
See ""Management--Employment Agreements,"" and ""--Consulting Agreements."" 

The foregoing represents the Company's current estimate of the allocation of
the net proceeds of the Offering based upon certain assumptions relating to the 
costs associated with the implementation of the Company's proposed business 
operations. Future events, including problems, delays, expenses and 
complications frequently encountered by companies which seek to develop new 
technologies or establish new services or introduce services to a new market, 
as well as changes in economic conditions, regulatory or competitive conditions,
and the success of the Company's marketing activities, may make shifts in the 
allocation of funds necessary or desirable. There can be no assurance that the 
Company's estimates will prove to be accurate or that unforeseen expenses will 
not be incurred. 

The Company believes that the net proceeds of this Offering will satisfy the 
Company's capital requirements for at least twelve months. During those twelve 
months, the Company's efforts will be directed at developing and implementing 
its proposed business operations. 

Prior to expenditures, the net proceeds of this Offering will be invested 
principally in high grade short-term interest-bearing investments. Any proceeds 
received upon exercise of the over-allotment option or any of the Company's 
Warrants will be used for working capital."

Stock offered hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
and estimated Offering and Merger expenses, are estimated to be $50.9 million 
($59.1 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). 

Of the net proceeds, $27.8 million will be used to pay the cash portion of the 
purchase price for the Founding Companies, some of which will be paid to former 
stockholders who will become officers, directors, or holders of more than 5% of 
the Common Stock. 

The remaining net proceeds from this Offering, which is estimated to be 
approximately $23.1 million, (excluding the net proceeds resulting from any 
over-allotment option as may be exercised by the underwriters) will be used, 
together with borrowings available from the Company's revolving credit facility
 discussed below, to repay substantially all of the $96.0 million of 
indebtedness of the Founding Companies. The majority of the Founding Companies' 
indebtedness is comprised of revolving credit facilities, which mature at 
various dates through 1999 and bear interest at rates ranging from a particular 
bank's prime rate to prime plus 1%. The current revolving credit facilities of 
the Founding Companies were used to refinance previous credit facilities and 
for current working capital and general corporate purposes. A portion of the 
outstanding Founding Company debt incurred during the past year was used to 
fund the S Corporation Distributions described elsewhere in this Prospectus. 
The Company will use the remaining portion of the revolving credit facility for 
general corporate purposes, working capital requirements and the cash portion 
of acquisitions. The Company currently has no binding or non-binding agreements 
to effect any future acquisitions. 

The Company has obtained a commitment for a five-year unsecured revolving 
credit facility of $150.0 million, which will be available upon the closing of 
this Offering. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

the net proceeds from the sale of 181,818 shares of Common Stock will be 
received by the Selling Stockholder and the net proceeds from the sale of 
28,182 shares of Common Stock will be received by the Company. See ""Principal

The Company intends to use approximately $3.0 million of the net proceeds for 
payments due upon the consummation of the Acquisitions, approximately $2.1 
million for the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness and approximately 
$138,000 principally for expenses related to the Acquisitions. Of the $2.1 
million intended to discharge indebtedness, $500,000 will repay a portion the 
10.25% note issued by AMC in the December 3, 1996 acquisition of HCD (the 
balance is to be satisfied by issuance prior to the consummation of the 
Offering of 181,818 Equivalent Shares of Common Stock), $355,000 will be used 
to repay an AMC 11.25% note scheduled to mature in 2003 and $560,000 will be 
used to repay three Rovak variable rate notes (10.25% at March 31, 1997) which 
mature variously from 1998 through 2000. The balance will be used to liquidate 
a number of smaller notes payable principally to banks. The balance of the net 
proceeds, approximately $900,000, will be used for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes, which are expected to include the acquisition of 
businesses offering products or technologies that are complementary to the 
Company's existing business. Although the Company is exploring acquisition 
opportunities, it has no agreements or understandings at this time to make any 
additional acquisitions and is not involved in any negotiation with respect to 
any such transactions except that the Company has entered into a letter of 
intent to acquire the business of a practice management systems provider which 
markets its products and services to podiatrists. The consideration payable is 
$500,000 payable in cash and Common Stock at the closing and an earnout of an 
additional $200,000 based upon future revenues. The revenues of the Company for 
its fiscal year ended December 31, 1996 were approximately $995,000. If 
acquired, this new business would be included in the Desktop Division. There 
can be no assurances that a definitive agreement will be entered into among the 
shareholders of the new business and the Company or that the acquisition will 
be consummated. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock offered hereby based upon the 
current state of its business operations, its current plans and current 
economic and industry conditions and is subject to reallocation among the 
categories listed above. The amounts and timing of actual expenditures will 
depend on numerous factors, including the status of the Company's income, the 
availability of alternative financing for acquisitions, the Company's business 
development activities and competition. Pending the aforementioned uses, the 
net proceeds from the Offering will be invested in interest-bearing government
 securities or short-term, investment grade securities. 

The Company has entered into a letter of intent with FINOVA Capital Corporation 
(""FINOVA"") to obtain a line of credit to be used for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. The Company 
anticipates entering into a definitive line of credit agreement following the 
consummation of the Offering. There can be no assurance that a line of credit 
will be obtained or that, if obtained, it will be on terms that are favorable 
to the Company. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Pro Forma Combined

The Company plans to use approximately $1.15 million of the net proceeds to 
repay the principal amount expected to be outstanding at the close of this 
Offering under the Company's credit agreement with Bergen Brunswig (the ""Bergen 
Brunswig Loan""). The proceeds of the Bergen Brunswig Loan were used primarily 
for the Company's acquisitions of six retail pharmacies located in Farmington, 
New Mexico; McLoud, Oklahoma; Cleburne, Texas; Covington and Marion, Virginia; 
and Tomah, Wisconsin. The Bergen Brunswig Loan bears interest at 2% above the 
prime rate announced from time to time by two banks. As of March 31, 1997, the 
effective interest rate on the Bergen Brunswig Loan was 10.5%. In addition, 
$325,000 will be paid to retire a portion of the debt incurred in connection 
with the Company's acquisition of the Vista Stores in March 1997, which bears 
interest at the rate of 8.5% and matures December 25, 1997, and $100,000 will 
be paid to retire certain debt incurred in connection with the redemption of 
the Common Stock held by a former shareholder. 

The Company will use approximately $2.4 million of the net proceeds of the 
Offering and may, in the future, incur additional debt, in connection with the 
acquisition of additional stores. The Company continually reviews acquisition 
proposals and is currently engaged in discussions with third parties with 
respect to possible acquisitions; however, the Company has no current 
agreements or commitments with respect to any potential acquisition. 

The Company will distribute $300,000 of the net proceeds to its existing 
shareholders. Approximately 45% of such distribution is intended to mitigate 
such shareholders' 1997 state and Federal tax liabilities accruing as a result 
of the Company's S corporation status from January 1, 1997 to the date such 
status will be terminated. 

Any remaining net proceeds are to be used for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes. Pending application of the proceeds described above, the 
net proceeds of the Offering will be invested in short-term, investment grade, 
interest-bearing securities."

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $13,679,000 
and $18,685,000 million (or $21,565,000 if the Valuation Range is increased by 
15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion--Stock Pricing and Number of 
Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. 
The Company will be unable to utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offerings 
until the consummation of the Conversion. 

The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank to 
be issued upon Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the 
Offerings. Based on net proceeds of $13.7 million to $18.7 million, the Company 
expects to utilize between $6.85 million and $9.35 million of net proceeds to 
purchase the common stock of the Bank. Such portion of net proceeds received by 
the Bank from the Company will be added to the Bank's general funds which the 
Bank currently intends to utilize for general corporate purposes including to 
increase its levels of one-to-four family real estate lending and, to a lesser 
extent, other lending, depending on market conditions as suitable opportunities 
arise. The Bank also intends to utilize the net proceeds for investments in 
short- and medium-term, investment grade debt securities and mortgage-backed 
securities. The Company may use net proceeds from the Conversion to purchase 
stock to fund the ISAP or to satisfy the exercise of options issued under the 
Stock Option Plan. See ""Management of the Bank--Benefits--Stock Option Plan"" 
and ""--Benefits--Incentive Stock Award Plan."" 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains to make the 
ESOP Loan to enable the ESOP to purchase, in the Conversion, or in the open 
market to the extent Common Stock is not available to fill the ESOP's 
subscription, 8% of the Common Stock issued in the Conversion. Based upon the 
sale of from 1,445,000 shares to 1,955,000 shares at the minimum and maximum of 
the Valuation Range, the amount of the ESOP Loan would be $1,156,000 or 
$1,564,000, respectively (or $1,798,600 if the maximum of the Valuation Range is
increased by 15%), with a term of ten years at an interest rate of 7.75% per 
year. The Company and Bank may alternatively choose to fund the ESOP's stock 
purchases through a loan by a third party financial institution. See ""Management
of the Bank--Benefits--Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" The remaining net 
proceeds retained by the Company will initially be invested in short- and 
medium-term debt obligations, mortgage-backed securities and other investment 
grade marketable equity securities, and may be invested in deposits in or loans 
to the Bank. 

The net proceeds may also be used to support the future expansion of operations 
through branch acquisitions, the establishment of branch offices and the 
acquisition of savings associations, savings banks and commercial banks or their
assets, or diversification into other banking related businesses. The Company 
and the Bank have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements 
regarding any such transactions. The Company, upon the Conversion, will be a 
unitary savings and loan holding company, which under existing laws would not 
be restricted as to the types of business activities in which it may engage. 
See ""Regulation--Holding Company Regulation"" for a description of certain 
regulations applicable to the Company. 

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company will 
have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, the Company may not 
repurchase any Common Stock in the first year after the Conversion and, during 
the next two following years, may only repurchase up to 5% of its outstanding 
capital stock during each twelve-month period. Further, the Company may not 
repurchase any of its Common Stock if the repurchase would cause the Bank to 
become ""undercapitalized"" within the meaning of the OTS's prompt corrective 
action regulation. See ""Regulation--Regulation of Federal Savings Associations--
Prompt Corrective Action."" Based upon facts and circumstances following the 
Conversion and subject to applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of 
Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and 
circumstances may include but are not limited to: (i) market and economic 
factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in the market, the 
volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms 
of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment, the ability to 
increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding 
shares, and the opportunity to improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the 
avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares 
to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans;
and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best 
interests of the Company and its stockholders. If the Company determines to 
repurchase stock, such repurchases may be made at prices in excess of the 
Purchase Price. To the extent that the Company repurchases stock at market 
prices in excess of the Purchase Price, such repurchases may have a dilutive 
effect upon the interests of existing stockholders. Any stock repurchases will 
be subject to the determination of the Board of Directors that both the Company 
and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory 
requirements after any such repurchases and that such capital will be adequate, 
taking into account, among other things, the level of non-performing and other 
risk assets, the Company's and the Bank's current and projected results of 
operations and asset/liability structure, the economic environment, tax and 
other considerations. See ""Regulation--Regulation of Federal Savings

approximately $8.5 million ($10.2 million if the over-allotment option granted 
to the Underwriters is exercised in full), after deduction of the underwriting

$3.3 million to pay down the balances on its existing credit facilities, consisting of 
a revolving line of credit in the amount of $2.7 million which bears interest 
annually at the prime rate and matures on February 28, 1998, and a revolving
 term credit facility in the amount of $670,000, which bears interest annually
 at the prime rate plus .25% and matures on July 1, 1999. The proceeds from
 these loans were used by the Company in the first fiscal quarter of 1997 to
 finance inventory and new store construction. The Company also intends to 
finance, in conjunction with future borrowings under the Company's credit 
facilities, approximately $3.1 million of the total $6.3 million required for
 planned new store expansion over the next 19 months, and to use approximately
 $350,000 to improve its point-of-sale system. The remaining net proceeds will
 be used for working capital and for other general corporate purposes. The 
expected applications of the net proceeds represent the Company's best estimates 
based upon its present plans and certain assumptions regarding general economic
 and industry conditions and the Company's anticipated future revenues and 
expenditures. If the Company's plans change, or its assumptions change or prove
 to be incorrect, the Company may reallocate some of the net proceeds within 
the above described categories or use the portions thereof for other purposes. 
Pending the application of the net proceeds as described above, such proceeds 
will be placed in interest-bearing bank accounts or invested in short-term 
United States government securities, certificates of deposit of major banks or
 high-grade commercial paper.

estimated to range from $55.7 million to $75.7 million, or up to $87.2 million
if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%. See ""PRO FORMA DATA"" for
the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Holding Company has received
conditional OTS approval to purchase all of the capital stock of the Association
to be issued in the Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the
Offerings. This will result in the Holding Company retaining approximately $27.9
million to $37.9 million of net proceeds, or up to $43.6 million if the
Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%, and the Association receiving an
equal amount.
         Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the Common Stock will
increase the Association's capital and will support the expansion of the
Association's existing business activities. The Association will use the funds
contributed to it for general corporate purposes, including, initially, local
lending and investment in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. The
Association also intends to use a portion of the funds (up to approximately $1.5
million) to contribute to the ongoing construction of two branch offices and the
renovation of an existing branch office.
         In connection with the Conversion and the establishment of the ESOP,
the Holding Company intends to loan the ESOP the amount necessary to purchase 8%
of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Conversion. The Holding Company's loan
to fund the ESOP may range from $4,556,000 to $6,164,000 based on the sale of
227,800 shares to the ESOP (at the minimum of the Estimated Valuation Range) and
308,200 shares (at the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range), respectively,
at $20.00 per share. If 15% above the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range,
or 4,430,375 shares, are sold in the Conversion, the Holding Company's loan to
the ESOP would be approximately $7,088,600. It is anticipated that the ESOP loan
will have a 12-year term with interest payable at the prime rate as published in
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL on the closing date of the Conversion. The loan will be
repaid principally from the Association's contributions to the ESOP and from any
dividends paid on shares of Common Stock held by the ESOP.
         The remaining net proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially
will be invested primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations.
Such proceeds will be available for additional contributions to the Association
in the form of debt or equity, to support future diversification or acquisition
activities, as a source of dividends to the stockholders of the Holding Company
and for future repurchases of Common Stock to the extent permitted under
Delaware law and federal regulations. The Holding Company will consider
exploring opportunities to use such funds to expand operations through acquiring
or establishing additional branch offices and the acquisition of other financial
institutions. Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements, agreements
or understandings, written or oral, regarding any diversification activities.
         Following consummation of the Conversion, the Board of Directors will
have the authority to adopt plans for repurchases of Common Stock, subject to
statutory and regulatory requirements. Since the Holding Company has not yet
issued stock, there currently is insufficient information upon which an
intention to repurchase stock could be based. The facts and circumstances upon
which the Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future
would include but are not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as
the price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading,
the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of
return and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book
value and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the
ability to improve the Holding Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of
dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the
exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any
other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the
Holding Company and its stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject to a
determination by the Board of Directors that both the Holding Company and the
Association will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory
requirements after any such repurchases and that capital will be adequate,
taking into account, among other things, the level of nonperforming and
classified assets, the Holding Company's and the Association's current and
projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic
environment and tax and other regulatory considerations. For a discussion of the
regulatory limitations applicable to stock repurchases and current OTS policy
respect thereto, see ""THE CONVERSION -- Restrictions on Repurchase of Stock."""

Stockholder. See ""Principal and Selling Stockholders."" 

The Company intends to use an estimated $7.5 million (approximately 100% of the 
estimated net proceeds) to repay a substantial portion of the Company's 
outstanding short-term indebtedness under its accounts receivable revolving 
line of credit with IBMCC. The outstanding balance under this accounts 
receivable revolving line of credit, which was incurred to finance working 
capital, was $10.4 million at March 31, 1997. Amounts outstanding under the 
accounts receivable revolving line of credit bear interest at a fluctuating 
rate equal to the prime interest rate plus 2.0%. At March 31, 1997, the 
interest rate in effect for the IBMCC accounts receivable revolving line of 
credit was 10.5% per annum. Principal and interest outstanding under the credit 
facility are due upon termination of the facility, which remains in effect for 
successive 13 month periods until terminated by the Company or IBMCC upon 60 
days written notice. 

The Company intends to expend an estimated $1.0 million for leasehold 
improvements and other capital expenditures, a majority of which will be 
expended in connection with the planned consolidation of its warehouse 
facilities into a single facility in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the relocation 
of its Dallas branch office and the opening of two branch offices in Austin and 
San Antonio, Texas. All or a portion of the $1.0 million in capital 
expenditures currently budgeted by the Company for such purposes may be paid 
from the net proceeds of the Offering remaining after repayment of short-term 
indebtedness, depending on the availability of remaining net offering proceeds 
at the time of such expenditures and the availability of other sources of funds.
 Any remaining proceeds available for working capital and general corporate 
purposes may be used to acquire complementary businesses and technologies. The 
Company is not currently a party to any commitments or agreements and is not 
currently involved in any negotiations with respect to any acquisitions.

billing data collection system product line in order to address more effectively 
the requirements of lower volume telecommunications switches. The Company also 
intends to apply approximately $1.4 million to the development of interfaces 
with switches utilized by wireless and international telecommunications systems.
 The Company also intends to apply approximately $1.0 million to enhance its 
international sales, marketing and support efforts. The remainder of the net

 at a conversion ratio based on the Price to Public in the Offering. The Series
 C Preferred Stock did not previously allow or require conversion upon the Offering.
 This Series C Preferred Stock previously accrued dividends at 12% a year. 
Therefore, the conversion is beneficial to the Company by extinguishing this 
dividend obligation. If any of the Former Holders does not elect to participate
 in the Stock Repurchase, the Company will purchase less than 558,000 shares of
 Common Stock from the Former Holders and the net proceeds not used in the Stock 
Repurchase will be available to the Company and will be used to repay additional 
amounts under the Senior Credit Facility. See ""Principal Shareholders and Selling 
Shareholders."" 
The terms of the Senior Credit Facility require that the Company use 50% of the
 net cash proceeds of the Offering, after the elimination of the Subordinated 
Debt and the redemption of the Series E Redeemable Preferred Stock, to repay a 
portion of the outstanding principal balance of the Senior Credit Facility. The
 Senior Credit Facility provides for advances to the Company of up to a maximum
 of $65.0 million and is repayable in 15 quarterly installments beginning on 
March 15, 1999, with repayment in full on or before September 30, 2002, if not 
earlier accelerated. Amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility accrue 
interest at varying rates applicable at the time of each advance. The Company 
can elect a rate tied to either the prime rate of CoreStates or LIBOR, each
 increased by the ""applicable margin,"" as defined in the Senior Credit Facility,
 which is dependent upon the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation, amortization and operating lease expense. The Company has approximately 
$53.0 million borrowed and currently outstanding under the Senior Credit 
Facility (excluding letters of credit) bearing interest at a weighted average
 rate of 8.3% per annum. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
 Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."""

to range from $12.1 million to $16.6 million, or up to $19.1 million if the 
Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%. See ""PRO FORMA DATA"" for the 
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Holding Company has received 
the approval of the OTS to purchase all of the capital stock of the Bank to be 
issued in the Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the 
Offerings. This will result in the Holding Company retaining approximately 
$6.1 million to $8.3 million of net proceeds, or up to $9.6 million if the 
Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%, and the Bank receiving an equal 
amount. 

Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the Common Stock will 
increase the Bank's capital and will support the expansion of the Bank's 
existing business activities. The Bank will use the funds contributed to it for 
general corporate purposes, including increased local lending, the 
establishment of its Clarkston, Washington office, the expansion of its 
community banking activities and possible future acquisitions of branches or 
banks. The Bank may also use a portion of the funds contributed to it to retire 
outstanding FHLB advances, depending on market conditions, the cost of other 
sources of funds and other factors. Pending deployment of funds, the Bank plans 
initially to invest the net proceeds in short-term U.S. Government and agency 
securities. Shares of Common Stock may be purchased with funds on deposit at 
the Bank, which will reduce deposits by the amount of such purchases. As a 
result, the net amount of funds available to the Bank for investment following 
receipt of the Conversion proceeds will be reduced by the amount of deposit 
withdrawals used to fund stock purchases. 

In connection with the Conversion and the establishment of the ESOP, the 
Holding Company intends to loan the ESOP the amount necessary to purchase 8% of 
the shares of Common Stock sold in the Conversion. The Holding Company's loan 
to fund the ESOP may range from $1,020,000 to $1,380,000 based on the sale to 
the ESOP of 102,000 shares (at the minimum of the Estimated Valuation Range) 
and 138,000 shares (at the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range), 
respectively, at $10.00 per share. If 15% above the maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range, or 1,983,750 shares, are sold in the Conversion, the Holding 
Company's loan to the ESOP would be approximately $1,587,000. It is anticipated 
that the ESOP loan will have a seven-year term with interest payable at the 
prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the closing date of the 
Conversion. The loan will be repaid principally from the Bank's contributions 
to the ESOP and from any dividends paid on shares of Common Stock held by the 
ESOP."

intends to repay indebtedness incurred in connection with the purchase of the 
UNCLE JOHN and the BALMORAL SEA ($19,000,000), to fund capital improvements to 
the UNCLE JOHN and other vessels ($3,500,000) and for the purchase of natural

of $19 million, bearing interest at the rate of 7.44% (Eurodollar option). In 
April 1997, the Company and Fleet Capital Corporation amended the Revolving 
Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the credit line to $40 
million, (ii) reduce the interest rate, (iii) release liens on ERT properties, 
(iv) reduce the financial covenants from four to one (a fixed charge coverage

COMMUNITY FIRST BANKING CO,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/community-first-banking-co-6619-8556,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/community-first-banking-co-6619-8556,424B3,5/22/1997,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=988480,"Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock cannot be 
determined until the Offerings are completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $29.9 
million and $40.7 million ($46.9 million assuming an increase in the Valuation 
Price Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" as to the assumptions used to arrive 
at such amounts. 

While the amount of net proceeds received by the Savings Bank will further
 strengthen the Savings Bank's capital position, which already exceeds all 
regulatory requirements, it should be noted that the Savings Bank is not 
converting primarily to raise capital. After the Conversion and Reorganization, 
the Savings Bank's tangible capital ratio (at the midpoint of the Valuation 
Price Range) on a pro forma basis at December 31, 1996 is expected to be 11.02% 
(after receipt by the Savings Bank of 50% of the net Conversion proceeds). See 
""Regulatory Capital."" As a result, the Savings Bank will continue to be a 
highly capitalized institution. The Savings Bank intends to continue after the 
Conversion and Reorganization with its strategy of emphasizing capital strength 
and continued growth in assets and earnings. 

It is expected that the Company's return on equity will initially be lower than 
historical levels as the Company and the Savings Bank deploy the proceeds from 
the Offerings. While the Board of Directors and management recognize this 
challenge will exist for the foreseeable future, the Company intends to manage 
capital through controlled growth, the payment of regular cash dividends and 
the possible payment of periodic special dividends. Management does not expect 
to pay any dividends that would be characterized as a tax-free return of 
capital. The Company may repurchase the Common Stock as market and regulatory 
limits permit. However, there can be no assurance that any dividends will be 
paid on the Common Stock or that the Company will repurchase any shares. See 
""Dividend Policy"" and ""Regulation."" 

The Company will purchase all of the capital stock of the Savings Bank to be 
issued in the Conversion in exchange for up to 50% of the net Conversion 
proceeds, and the Company will retain the remaining 50% of the net proceeds or
 more, if permitted. The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds 
that it retains to make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to 
purchase up to 8.0% of the Common Stock. Based upon the issuance of 1,551,250 
shares or 2,098,750 shares at the minimum and maximum of the Valuation Price 
Range, respectively, the loan to the ESOP would be $2.5 million and $3.4
 million, respectively. See ""Management of the Company -Benefits- Employee
 Stock Ownership Plan."" The remaining net proceeds retained by the Company will
 be initially used to invest primarily in short-term investment securities and 
deposits in or loans to the Savings Bank. The portion of the net proceeds 
retained by the Company may ultimately be used to support the Savings Bank's 
lending activities, to support the future expansion of operations through 
establishment of additional branch offices or other customer facilities, 
acquisitions of other financial institutions, expansion into other lending 
markets or diversification into other banking related businesses (although no 
such transactions are specifically being considered at this time), and for 
other business and investment purposes, including the payment of regular cash 
dividends and possible repurchases of the Common Stock and special dividends. 
Management of the Company may consider expanding or diversifying, should such 
opportunities become available. Funds contributed to the Savings Bank will be 
invested initially in short- to intermediate-term United States government and 
agency securities. The proceeds also will be used to support the Savings Bank's 
lending and investment activities and thereby enhance the Savings Bank's 
capabilities to serve the borrowing and other financial needs of the 
communities it serves. Neither the Savings Bank nor the Company has any 
specific plans, arrangements, or understandings regarding any acquisitions or 
diversification of activities at this time, nor have criteria been established 
to identify potential candidates for acquisition. 
Following the one-year anniversary of the completion of the Conversion 
(or sooner if permitted by the OTS), and based upon then existing facts and 
circumstances, the Company's Board of Directors may determine to repurchase 
shares of Common Stock, subject to any applicable statutory and regulatory 
requirements. Such facts and circumstances may include but are not limited to 
(i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the 
investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of 
the remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in the Company's return on 
equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue 
additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee 
stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases 
would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Any stock 
repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Company's Board of 
Directors that both the Company and the Savings Bank will be capitalized in 
excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and 
to receipt of necessary regulatory approvals or non-objections from the OTS. 
The payment of dividends or repurchase of stock, however, would be prohibited 
if equity would be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation 
account. See ""Dividend Policy,"" ""Regulation - Bank Regulation - Prompt 
Corrective Action -Capital Distributions,"" and ""The Conversion and 
Reorganization - Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares after 
the Conversion and Reorganization."" 

The Company will be a unitary savings and loan holding company which, under 
existing laws, would generally not be restricted as to the types of business 
activities in which it may engage, provided that the Savings Bank continues to 
be a qualified thrift lender (""QTL""). See ""Regulation - The Company"" for a 
description of certain regulations applicable to the Company. Any portion of 
the net proceeds in excess of the amount retained by the Company will be added 
to the Savings Bank's general funds to be used for general corporate purposes, 
including increased lending activities and purchases of investment and 
mortgage-backed securities. 

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the Conversion and 
Reorganization may be more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will 
also vary if the number of shares to be issued in the Offerings is adjusted to 
reflect a change in the estimated pro forma market value of the Savings Bank. 
Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at
 the Savings Bank will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by 
the Savings Bank but will result in a reduction of the Savings Bank's interest 
expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing 
certificates or other deposit accounts."

the Merck Loan is February 7, 1999, under its terms the Company is required to 
prepay the Merck Loan in full upon the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement (as defined in 'Additional Information'). Interest on the Merck Loan 
accrues at a rate of two percentage points above the prime rate as reported in 
The Wall Street Journal (adjusted annually). At March 31, 1997, the interest 
rate on the Merck Loan was 10.25%. The Merck Loan is secured by a pledge of the 
Company's inventory and accounts receivable. The proceeds from the Merck Loan 
have been used by the Company for the development of accuDEXA(Trademark) and to 
obtain any necessary regulatory approvals. See 'Business--Merck Agreement.' 

From time to time, the Company evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses 
and product lines which would complement or enhance the business of the Company.
 Depending on the cash requirements of any such acquisitions, the Company may 
finance such acquisitions, in whole or in part, with a portion of the net

of the Company Offering and the maximum Selling Agents' commissions, will be
approximately $670,000.  Management anticipates that the proceeds will be
applied with the following priority during the next twelve (12) month period:

     DESCRIPTION OF USE                  AMOUNT        PERCENT
     Put Option Exercise(1)             $304,500         45.4%
     Working Capital(2)                  365,500         54.6%
     Total:                             $670,000        100.0%

(1)  Reflects the Company's total obligation in the event all 203,008 Puts are
     exercised at a put price of $1.50 per share.  If fewer than 203,008 Puts
     are exercised, the excess proceeds allocated to cover the exercise of
     outstanding Puts will be re-allocated to working capital and/or the
     reduction of existing debt obligations of the Company.

(2)  The proceeds allocated to working capital will be applied, to the extent
     necessary, to the Company's current and proposed operations.  (See
     ""MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION."")  However, as
     it is an inherent part of the Company's strategic plan to achieve long-
     term growth through acquisitions and/or the development of additional
     stations, a portion of the proceeds allocated to working capital may be
     used in connection with the development of one or more additional radio
     stations, including the possible development of KLXR-AM in Redding,
     California, and/or the development of radio stations in Payson, Arizona,
     Shasta Lake City, California and/or Mesquite, Nevada.  While the Company
     regularly evaluates opportunities for the acquisition of existing radio
     stations, other than KLXR-AM, there are no substantive negotiations,
     arrangements, agreements or understandings with respect to any potential
     acquisition.  The Company's development plans are currently limited to the
     development of one (1) station in Payson, Arizona and, possibly stations
     in Shasta Lake City and/or Mesquite, Nevada.  (See ""BUSINESS."")

     Due to an inability to precisely forecast the number of shares which may
be sold by the Company in the Company Offering, the Company is unable to
predict the precise period for which the Company Offering will provide
financing.  The proceeds of the Company Offering will not be sufficient to
satisfy all of the Company's working capital requirements.  The Company will
need additional financing in the future.  (See ""RISK FACTORS"")"

(1) Represents repayment of (i) the $850,000 principal amount of Bridge Notes 
issued in the Bridge Financing completed by the Company in March 1997, 
(ii) the $200,000 principal amount of Outstanding Convertible Shareholder Notes,
 (iii) $90,000 principal amount of notes issued to Mr. Paul DePond, President 
and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the ""DePond Notes""), 
(iv) $200,000 principal amount of a note issued to Michael Ballard, a director 
of the Company (the ""Ballard Note""), and (v) $175,000 principal amount of a 
note issued to Sutton Partners, L.P., the limited partners of which are the 
grandchildren of the sole stockholder of the Underwriter (the ""Sutton Note""). 
All of such loans were used for working capital. 
(2) Represents costs for research and development of new products and 
enhancements of current products. 
(3) Represents funds required for the implementation of marketing programs, 
sales materials, advertising, trade shows and the hiring, training and 
employment of additional sales, marketing, and support personnel. 
(4) Represents the cost of establishing manufacturing inventories for projected 
sales of current products. 
(5) Represents fixed asset requirements that are anticipated to support new 
product development and to establish and maintain an adequate customer service 
and warranty tracking system. 
(6) Represents funds that are to be used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, including $350,000 for salaries for executive officers, 
office expenses and other general overhead expenses. 
The proposed use of the net offering proceeds described herein represents the 
Company's anticipated use of the proceeds based upon current operating plans 
and certain assumptions, including those relating to the Company's future 
revenue levels and expenditures, and assumptions regarding industry and general 
economic conditions and other conditions. Future events, including problems, 
delays, expenses and complications frequently encountered by early stage 
companies, as well as changes in competitive conditions affecting the Company's 
business and the success or lack thereof of the Company's research and 
development or marketing and sales efforts, may make it necessary or advisable 
for the Company to reallocate the net proceeds among the above uses or use 
portions of the net proceeds for other purposes. Any such shifts will be at the 
discretion of the Company. 

The Company anticipates, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the net proceeds of the Offering, together 
with projected cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy the 
Company's contemplated cash requirements for the next 12 months. If the 
Company's estimates prove incorrect, the Company will have to seek alternative 
sources of financing during such period, including debt and equity financing 
and the reduction of operating costs and projected growth plans. No assurance 
can be given that such financing could be obtained by the Company on favorable 
terms, if at all, and if the Company is unable to obtain needed financing, the 
Company's business would be materially adversely affected. See ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" 
Pending application, the net proceeds of the Offering will be invested in 
short-term, high grade interest-bearing savings accounts, certificates of 
deposit, United States government obligations, money market accounts or short- 
term interest bearing obligations. Any proceeds received upon exercise of the 
Underwriter's over-allotment option, the Warrants, the Underwriter's Unit 
Purchase Option, as well as income from investments, are currently intended to 
be used for general corporate purposes."
CENTERPOINT CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/centerpoint-corp-2777-8796,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/centerpoint-corp-2777-8796,424B1,8/27/1997,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=967296,"The Company intends to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the 
offering, together with the interest earned thereon, to attempt to effect a 
Business Combination, including selecting and evaluating potential Target 
Businesses and structuring, negotiating and consummating a Business Combination 
(including possible payment of finder's fees or other compensation to persons 
or entities which provide assistance or services to the Company). Approximately 
84% of the gross proceeds of the offering by the Company (representing an amount
equal to the $8,000,000 gross proceeds from the sale of the Units as a 
percentage of the gross proceeds of this offering) will be held in an escrow 
account maintained by the Proceeds Escrow Agent, until the earlier of written 
notification by the Company to the Proceeds Escrow Agent (i) of the Company's 
completion of a transaction or series of transactions in which at least 50% of 
the gross proceeds from this offering is committed to a specific line of 
business as a result of a consummation of a Business Combination (including any 
redemption payments), or (ii) to distribute the escrowed proceeds, in connection
with a redemption of the Company's Class A Stock, to the then holders of the 
Class A Stock purchased as part of the Units sold in this offering or acquired 
in the open market thereafter. All proceeds held in the escrow account will be 
invested, until released, in short-term United States government securities, 
including treasury bills, cash and cash equivalents. 

Except as noted below, the proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Class B 
Stock will not be placed in escrow. Rather, these proceeds will be used 
(i) to repay indebtedness, (ii) to pay the balance of a $100,000 license fee, 
or $90,000, due to Bright pursuant to a license agreement executed by Bright and
the Company, (iii) to cover all of the expenses incurred by the Company in this
offering, including the Underwriters' discounts and the Representative's non-
accountable expense allowance, and (iv) to fund the Company's operating 
expenses, including investment banking fees and the costs of business, legal and
accounting due diligence on prospective Target Businesses, until the Company 
effects a Business Combination. See ""Proposed Business -- Servicemark License."" 
However, in addition, a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Class 
B Stock equal to the Underwriters' discounts and the Representative's non-
accountable expense allowance with respect to the Units will be placed in the 
above-mentioned escrow account for the benefit of purchasers of Class A Stock 
as part of the Units sold in this offering and in the open market thereafter. 
In addition, proceeds from the sale of the Class B Stock will be used for the 
general administrative expenses of the Company, including legal and accounting 
fees and administrative support expenses in connection with the Company's 
reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. The Company may seek to issue 
additional securities if it requires additional funds to meet its operating and 
administrative expenses. The Company has agreed with the Representative that it 
will not issue (other than pursuant to this offering) any securities or grant 
options or Warrants to purchase any securities of the Company without the 
consent of the Representative for a period of 18 months from the date of this 
Prospectus and for up to six additional months if the Extension Criteria have 
been satisfied. 

To the extent that the Company's securities are used as consideration to effect 
a Business Combination, the balance of the net proceeds of this offering not 
expended will be used to finance the operations (including the possible 
repayment of debt) of the Target Business. No cash compensation will be paid to 
any officer or director until after the consummation of the first Business 
Combination. Since the role of the Company's current directors and executive 
officers after a consummation of a Business Combination is uncertain, the 
Company has no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to 
such persons after such consummation of a Business Combination."

    custom-designed countertop display humidors.
(2) Represents  the  amount  needed  to  maintain  adequate  inventory levels to
    support  retail  sales  turnover. Stores will keep only enough stock to fill
    their  countertop  humidors  due  to  the  care  required  to maintain cigar
    freshness.  In  addition,  deposits  are  required  on  some  overseas cigar
    purchase orders.

    principal  amount of $1,000,000,  and the oustanding  balance,  if any, of a
    $200,000 bank credit line. The bridge notes accrue  interest at a rate of 8%
    per year until  completion of this offering and at 16% per year  thereafter.
    The  bridge  notes  are  due on the  earlier  of the  consummation  of  this
    offering, or six months after issuance, but may be paid up to two years from
    their issuance. Proceeds from the bridge notes were used to purchase cigars,
    humidors and related items, capital equipment and to pay salaries,  business
    expenses,   office  costs  and   professional   and  consulting   fees.  The
    Consolidated  Balance Sheet and the Consolidated  Statement of Cash Flows in

    $200,000 bank credit line obtained on July 25, 1997.

(5) Represents  a  minimum  level  of  working  capital  for  general  corporate
    purposes  such  as  advertising,  customer  education,  deposits  and  other
    prepaid assets.

the rollout of the PCI Cigar  Program with  national  chain  accounts and others
throughout  the United  States and Canada.  Our plan is to reach  10,000  retail
outlets by the end of this fiscal year,  March 31, 1998,  and add 10,000  stores
each year.  Our aggressive  growth plans require  extensive  working  capital to
supply  each  store  with  a  custom  designed   humidor,   premium  cigars  and
accessories.  In  addition,  we plan to use  $1,000,000  to  retire  the  bridge
financing  indebtedness  and an  additional  amount  to retire  the  outstanding
balance,  if any, of a $200,000  bank credit  line.  See  ""Interim  Financing --
Bridge  Financing and Bridge  Warrants."" The use of proceeds  disclosed above is
subject to change. If our use of proceeds does change, we believe it would be to
reallocate  more  proceeds to purchase  cigars and humidors and less proceeds to
sales and marketing.
     Pending  use,  the net proceeds  will be invested in bank  certificates  of
deposit  and  other  fully-insured  investment  grade  securities.  Any funds we
receive  from  exercise  of the  over-allotment  option or the  representatives'

Stock offered by the Company are estimated to be approximately $29.0 million, 
after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses 
payable by the Company. 

The net proceeds to the Company will be used as follows: (i) approximately $5.9 
million to repurchase 788,500 shares of Common Stock owned by Shansby on the 
date of this Prospectus at a repurchase price equal to the net proceeds (before 
offering expenses) to be received by the Company with respect to an equivalent 
number of shares, (ii) to pay the $12 million cash consideration to Mr. 
Tanklage pursuant to the La Victoria Acquisition, as well as $350,000 of related 
transaction expenses, (iii) to repay outstanding indebtedness under the
Company's $2 million revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility""), 
which had a balance of approximately $1.4 million as of June 30, 1997, (iv) to 
repay outstanding indebtedness under the Company's term loan facility (the 
""Term Loan""), which had a balance of approximately $363,000 as of June 30, 1997, 
(v) to repay outstanding indebtedness on a note to the former owners of the 
Company (the ""Calidad Shareholder Note""), which had a balance of approximately 
$717,000 as of June 30, 1997 and (vi) the remainder for working capital and 
general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. With the exception of the 
La Victoria Acquisition, and except as noted below, the Company does not 
currently have any specific agreements, understandings or negotiations in 
connection with any future acquisitions. Although the Company has begun 
preliminary discussions with respect to the possible acquisition of a small 
tortilla manufacturer in Houston, Texas, there can be no assurance that this 
acquisition will be consummated. 

In connection with the repayment of the amounts outstanding under the Revolving 
Facility, the Company intends to terminate the Revolving Facility upon the 
consummation of this Offering. As of June 30, 1997, the weighted average 
interest rate under the Revolving Facility was 10.25% and the weighted average 
interest rate under the Term Loan was 10.50% per annum. The Term Loan matures 
on November 1, 1999. The Term Loan is secured by a first lien on Calidad's 
equipment, and the Revolving Facility is secured by a first lien on Calidad's 
equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and general intangibles. The Calidad 
Shareholder Note matures on March 26, 1999, bears interest at 10.50% per annum 
and is secured by a second lien on Calidad's equipment, inventory, accounts 
receivable and general intangibles. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis

(i) distribute to current stockholders an amount equal to undistributed S 
corporation earnings through the Termination Date and (ii) pay current 
stockholders the previously declared $1.1 million distribution. The Company 
currently estimates that undistributed accumulated earnings as of the

Termination Date. See ""Termination of S Corporation Status and Related 
Distributions"" and ""Dividend Policy."" 

The Company also intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to repay various 
bank term loans and any balance outstanding on its line of credit. The Company's 
term loans had an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately $5.6 million 
as of June 30, 1997. This balance includes approximately $2.9 million borrowed 
to finance the Company's April 1, 1997 acquisition in Orlando and the June 1, 
1997 acquisition in San Francisco, which loans are due in June 2000 and bear 
interest at the bank's Prime Rate plus 0.50%. The remaining term loan balance 
is comprised of a $1.5 million note bearing interest at the bank's Prime Rate 
plus 0.50% due June 1999, a $1.1 million note bearing interest at 8.70% due 
August 1998 and a $104,000 note bearing interest at 8.08% due July 1997 (which 
has been paid in full), the borrowings under all of which were used for general 
working capital purposes. The Company's line of credit bears interest at the 
bank's Prime Rate plus 0.50% and at June 30, 1997 had an outstanding balance of 
$2.0 million. 

The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to 
finance the acquisition of other interim housing businesses. The Company 
currently does not have any commitment, understanding or arrangement with 
respect to any acquisition. 

All proceeds not used as described above will be used for working capital or 
other general corporate purposes. Pending utilization of the proceeds of this

credit facility. The revolving credit facility provides for maximum borrowings 
of $4.0 million, and had an outstanding balance of $2.5 million as of June 30, 
1997. The term credit facility had an original principal amount of $5.0 
million, and had an outstanding balance of $4.7 million as of June 30, 1997. 
Both facilities bear interest at floating rates that may be fixed for 180-day

Pending Transfers will be approximately $3.1 million, of which up to 20% is 
payable in cash and the remainder with shares of Common Stock issued pursuant 
to the Shelf Registration. The actual number of shares to be issued will be 
determined based upon the market price of the Common Stock, calculated pursuant

Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting 
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to 
use approximately $964,000 of the net proceeds of the offering to repay a 
promissory note held by AWW's primary lender, which note bears interest at the 
prime rate plus 2.75%, matures on September 15, 1997 and is guaranteed by 
William H. Wilson, Jr., a key employee of the Company, and approximately 
$780,000 to repay certain promissory notes held by former stockholders of AWW, 
of which approximately $341,000 will go to Mr. Wilson. Each of these notes 
bears interest at a rate of 10% and has a maturity date of January 1, 1998. 
Approximately $1.2 million of the proceeds will be used to repay certain 
indebtedness of the Mesa Companies, all of which was incurred or personally 
guaranteed by Thomas B. Blanton, an officer and director of the Company, as the 
former sole stockholder of the Mesa Companies. Approximately $214,000 of this 
$1.2 million will be paid to the brother-in-law of Mr. Blanton. These debts 
have maturity dates ranging from September 1997 to October 2006 and bear 
interest at rates ranging from 0% to 25.7%. See ""Risk Factors--Significant 
Amount of Offering Proceeds Payable to or for the Benefit of Affiliates of the 
Company"" and ""Certain Transactions--Other."" Approximately $1.5 million of the 
proceeds will be used for capital expenditures to be made by the Company. The 
Company intends to use the balance of the net proceeds of the offering of 
approximately $7.9 million (assuming no exercise of the Underwriter's over-
allotment option) for working capital and general corporate purposes, which are 
expected to include future acquisitions. The Company currently has no 
agreements or understandings to make any acquisitions. See ""Business--Strategy.""

offered hereby, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
 estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, are estimated to be 
approximately $6.3 million. The Company intends to use $600,000 of the net
 proceeds to repay a senior subordinated promissory note (the 'Senior Note') 
and to use the remaining net proceeds of approximately $5.7 million to pay a 
substantial portion of the purchase price for the five UA Theaters. If the 
Company decides not to exercise its right to purchase the five UA Theaters, but
 does decide to purchase one UA Theater in New City, New York, the Company 
intends to use approximately $1.4 million of the net proceeds of the Offering 
to purchase that theater and will be obligated under the Current Facility to use
 the remaining net proceeds of approximately $4.3 million to prepay, in part,
 the outstanding term loans under the Current Facility. If the Company does not
 acquire any UA Theater within 90 days after the consummation of the Offering,
 the Company will be obligated under the Current Facility to use the remaining 
net proceeds of approximately $5.7 million to prepay, in part, the outstanding
 term loans under the Current Facility. See 'Business--Recent Developments.' 
If the Company does acquire all five UA Theaters within 90 days of the consummation 
of the Offering, the Company's obligation to prepay the outstanding term loans
 under the Current Facility with any of the net proceeds of the Offering will be
 permanently waived. See 'Certain Transactions.' The Company will need to obtain
 additional financing either under the New Facility or otherwise in order to 
consummate the acquisition of all five UA Theaters. See 'Risk Factors--Expansion 
Plans--Need for Additional Financing.' Pending any such uses, net proceeds will
 be invested in short-term, interest bearing, investment grade securities. 
The Senior Note that will be repaid with a portion of the net proceeds from the 
Offering was issued by the Company as part of the consideration for three theaters 
acquired by the Company in December, 1996. The principal amount of the Senior 
Note is $600,000 and its interest rate until December 13, 1997 is 12% per annum 
and increases 2% each year thereafter to a maximum of 18%. The Senior Note will
 mature at the earlier to occur of December 13, 2001 or the consummation of an 
initial public offering of debt or equity securities by the Company. 
The term loans outstanding under the Current Facility as of July 31, 1997 were 
incurred to finance the acquisitions and capital expenditures that occurred in 
1996, to finance the renovation of the theaters in Chester and Summit, New 
Jersey in 1997 and to repurchase the Provident Warrants. As of March 31, 1997,
 the total outstanding principal amount of the term loans was approximately 
$8.7 million. The interest rate on the term loans equals two percent (2%) above
 Provident's prime rate, other than the term loan used to repurchase the 
Provident Warrants, and is currently 10.5%. Interest is payable monthly in 
arrears. The final maturity of one of the original term loans is July 1, 2001,
 the final maturity of the other original term loan is December 31, 2001 and 
the final maturity of the third term loan (used, in part, to finance the repurchase 
of the Provident Warrants) is the earlier of June 30, 2002 or 90 days after the
 consummation of the Offering. The Company is obligated to pay principal on a 
quarterly basis pursuant to an amortization schedule set forth in the Current
 Facility. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources.'"

The Company intends to use the net proceeds for research and development, 
working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company expects to expand 
its proprietary research, drug discovery and drug development activities, 
including the further development of its leukocyte-based platform technologies 
and its proprietary product development programs in cancer and inflammatory, 
autoimmune and viral diseases. The Company also expects to spend funds to 
recruit and employ additional scientific and technical staff and to increase 
capabilities in the area of preclinical and clinical testing. Further, the 
Company plans to expand its facilities to accommodate these additional staff, 
as well as to support additional activities with collaborative partners. The 
Company also may spend funds on clinical development activities for its 
proprietary product candidates. The Company may use a portion of its available 
cash to acquire technologies or products under its strategy to continue to 
broaden its platform technologies. The Company may use a portion of its 
available cash to acquire or invest in companies complementary to its business. 
The Company is not currently in any negotiations with respect to any such 
acquisitions or investments. The amounts actually expended for each purpose may 
vary significantly depending upon numerous factors including the progress of 
the Company's research and development programs, the results of preclinical

bearing securities. 

The Company believes that the net proceeds of this offering, together with its 
existing capital resources, interest income and revenue from the collaboration 
agreements, will be sufficient to fund its currently planned operating expenses 
and capital requirements through early 2000. However, there can be no assurance 
that such funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's operating expenses 
and capital requirements during such period. The Company's actual cash 
requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend upon 
numerous factors, including the results of the Company's research and 
development and collaboration programs, the timing and results of preclinical 
and clinical trials, the timing and costs of obtaining regulatory approvals, 
the progress of the milestone and royalty producing activities of the 
Company's collaborative partners, the level of resources that the Company 
commits to the development of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, 
the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other 
intellectual property rights, the ability of the Company to maintain existing 
and establish new collaboration agreements with other companies, the 
technological advances and activities of competitors and other factors. 

The Company's management will have broad discretion to allocate proceeds 
of this offering to uses that it believes are appropriate. There can be no 
assurance that the proceeds of this offering can or will be invested to yield a 
positive return."

The initial application of the net proceeds of this Offering represents 
management's estimate based upon current business and economic conditions. 
Although the Company does not contemplate material changes in such allocations, 
to the extent the Company finds that an adjustment is required due to changed 
business conditions, the amounts may be adjusted among the uses indicated. The 
Company is financing construction of its administration, manufacturing, 
research and development facility with mortgage financing from a commercial 
lending institution, and although it also intends to finance construction of 
its Radioisotope Production Facility, estimated to cost $3,500,000, through 
additional mortgage financing, there can be no assurance such financing will be 
obtained, in which event the Company may be required to fund such construction,
 in whole or in part, with a portion of the net proceeds from this Offering (in 
which event the Company may be required to reduce amounts currently allocated 
to other uses), or alternative sources of financing, the availability of which 
cannot be assured. See ""Risk Factors-- Possible Need for Additional Financing"" 
and ""Plan of Operation--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

Although the Company believes that the net proceeds of this Offering will be 
sufficient to finance its activities for at least 18 months following the date 
of this Prospectus, there can be no such assurance. See ""Risk Factors-- 
Possible Need For Additional Financing"" and ""Plan of Operation."" 

To the extent that the Company's application of the net proceeds are less than 
as allocated or if the net proceeds increase as a result of the exercise of the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option, the resulting proceeds will be added to 
the Company's working capital and will be available for general corporate 
purposes. The net proceeds of this Offering that are not expended immediately 
will be deposited in interest-bearing accounts or invested in government 
obligations, certificates of deposit or similar short-term, low-risk 
investments."

(1) The Company's current expansion strategy contemplates the opening of approximately nine new 
resident ""four-wall"" productions by May 1999, which the Company intends to 
accomplish with proceeds from the Bridge Financing and this offering and 
revenues generated from its current and, as they open, new productions (for 
instance, by the end of 1995, the Company's Surfside Theatre production, a 
resident ""four-wall"" production opened in March 1995, had already generated 
approximately $300,000 in gross profits after deducting all pre-opening costs). 
Costs associated with the opening (typically a three- to six-month process 
after the theater site is secured) of new resident ""four-wall"" productions in 
resort and urban tourist markets, include lease deposits and down payments; 
costs associated with leasehold improvements and signage; the lease and/or 
purchase of capital equipment, such as lighting, sound and concession equipment 
and computer ticketing systems; pre-opening advertising launch campaigns; 
merchandising and inventory; purchase and physical loading of sets, costumes 
and props; pre-show rehearsals and staffing; and estimated running cost floats 
for expected two- to four-week initial operating deficits. The Company expects 
that such opening costs will be between $400,000 and $800,000 for productions 
in leased locations (the Company's primary focus) and up to $1,000,000 for 
productions in purchased locations. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Expansion Plans"" and 
""Business."" 
(2) Represents the repayment of the Bridge Notes in the aggregate principal 
amount of $1,000,000, including Bridge Notes in the principal amounts of 
$50,000, $25,000 and $12,500 payable to Kenneth Berg, a director of the 
Company, David Hope, the President, Chief Operating Officer and a director of 
the Company, and Kiranjit S. Sidhu, the Senior Vice President and Chief 
Financial Officer of the Company, respectively, and the repayment of the DYDX 
Loan in the principal amount of $750,000, plus interest accrued thereon (in 
each case, at the rate of 9% per annum) through and until the anticipated date 
of repayment in the estimated aggregate amount of $25,000. The proceeds from 
the February 1996 DYDX Loan were used for the payment of outstanding trade 
payables, capital improvements to the Surfside Theater, working capital and 
general corporate purposes. The proceeds from the Company's recent Bridge 
Financing were used for the payment of outstanding trade payables, pre-opening 
expenditures on the Daytona Beach show and the seasonal Branson show, certain 
pre-offering expenses related to this offering and for working capital and 
general corporate purposes. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital 
Resources"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 

(3) The Company intends to hire an Executive Vice President of Production, a 
Management Information Systems Director and a Merchandising Director over the 
next year, as well as several regional corporate event salespersons by the end 
of 1998. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations -- Overview"" and ""Business -- Expansion Strategy."" 

(4) Includes costs associated with the Company's plan to expand and improve its 
information technology system and to further develop the use of the Hollywood 
Inventory Tracking System (""H.I.T.S.""), an asset management system, throughout 
the Company. See ""Business -- Show Merchandising"" and ""-- Operations and Show 
Implementation."" 
If the Underwriter exercises the over-allotment option in full, the Company 
will realize additional net proceeds of $931,770. If the 1,400,000 Warrants 
offered hereby are exercised, the Company will realize proceeds relating 
thereto of $7,700,000 before any solicitation fees which may be paid in 
connection therewith. Such additional proceeds, if received, are expected to be 
used primarily for additional new show openings and for working capital and 
general corporate purposes. See ""Underwriting."" 
The allocation of the net proceeds to be received by the Company from this 
offering as set forth above represents the Company's best estimates based upon 
its currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its operations and 
expansion strategy and certain assumptions regarding general economic 
conditions. The Company anticipates, based on management's internal forecasts 
and assumptions relating to its operations (including the anticipated timetable 
of new show openings and the costs associated therewith), that the net proceeds 
of this offering and the Bridge Financing, together with its current cash and 
cash equivalent balances and anticipated revenues from operations, will be 
sufficient to funds its current expansion strategy, as well as its other cash 
and operating requirements for 24 months following the consummation of this 
offering. In the event that the Company's plans change, its assumptions change 
or prove inaccurate, or if the proceeds of this offering and cash flow 
otherwise prove to be insufficient to fund the Company's plans (due to 
unanticipated financial shortfalls in the Company's results of operations, 
changes in economic conditions or other unforeseen circumstances), the Company 
could be required to seek additional financing following this offering in order 
to continue implementation of its proposed expansion plans. There can be no 
assurance, however, that additional financing will be available to the Company 
if and when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in short-term investment grade debt obligations, bank 
certificates of deposit, United States Government money market instruments or 
other short-term interest bearing investments."

and the simultaneous sale of 800,000 Warrants for $40,000 (see ""Interim Financing"")
 were utilized for working capital to support the Company's accounts receivable,
 and the balance was used to pay certain of the expenses of conducting this 
offering. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

(2) Includes extruders, densifiers, mixers and materials handling equipment. 
(3) The Company purchases raw materials on an opportunistic basis and will from 
time to time use a portion of the proceeds to purchase quantities of feedstock
 materials. The Company has no agreement in principle with any potential acquisition 
candidate and therefore cannot at this time accurately state what percentage of
 the proceeds will be allocated to acquisitions. See ""Risk Factors -- Expansion 
Strategy; Unspecified Acquisitions."" A portion of working capital will be used 
to self-finance accounts receivable (up to $500,000, assuming no increase in the 
Company's existing credit facilities), and a further portion of approximately 
$200,000-$300,000 will be utilized for additional sales and marketing efforts,
 including the addition of sales personnel. 
The allocation of the net proceeds of the offering set forth above represents 
the Company's best estimate based upon its present plans. If any of these plans
 change, the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of 
the proceeds within the above-described categories or to other purposes. 
Pending expenditure of the proceeds from the offering, the Company may make
 temporary investments in insured interest bearing savings accounts, insured 
certificates of deposit, or short term United States government obligations. In
 the opinion of management, the above proceeds should be sufficient for the 
Company's operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this offering."

1998. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for the further 
development of the ChromaVision Digital Analyzer technology, including clinical 
trials and certain pre-marketing activities, working capital, general corporate

it intends to utilize on each of such uses, or the timing of such uses. The 
amounts actually expended for each use may vary significantly depending upon a

The Company's expansion strategy focuses on adding personnel, expanding existing
facilities and establishing new facilities in a manner designed to enable the 
Company to remain profitable. As a result, the Company anticipates adding 
personnel and enlarging existing and establishing new facilities only in 
instances when it has a reasonable expectation that long term demand will be 
sufficient to maintain and enhance the profitability demonstrated by current or 
near term projects and existing or anticipated near term demand. 

The growth anticipated by the Company will necessitate additional office space 
to house its workforce. Management believes that this expansion will occur near 
its existing facility and in one or two new geographic locations. Although the 
Company believes that additional space will be available as needed on 
commercially reasonable terms, there can be no assurance that market rates for 
such additional space will not exceed current expectations, requiring future 
expenditures in amounts greater than those currently anticipated. 

The expansion and addition of office space and personnel will require 
acquisition of new or upgrading of current computer hardware and software in two
aspects: office infrastructure and individual workstations. Office 
infrastructure purchases relate to the creation or upgrading of internal 
networks, multiple development environments and the related security hardware 
and software. The Company anticipates purchases of these items will occur 
shortly after the expansion or opening of an office. The Company further expects
that individual workstation purchases will coincide with the addition of 
personnel, normally on a person by person basis. 

The planning and development of complex Web sites often require several months 
to complete. As a result, the Company expects to use a portion of the estimated 
proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock offered hereby to fund the salaries
and the other direct project costs related to work-in-progress on planning and 
development contracts. In addition, the Company anticipates using a portion of 
the estimated net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock offered hereby to fund 
additional costs associated with increased marketing, advertising and new 
business development activities as the Company attempts to expand both the 
number of its clients and the scope of the projects it undertakes. 
Approximately, $300,000 of the estimated net proceeds from the sale of Common 
Stock offered hereby may be used by the Company to retire the current balance 
outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit with the Company's bank. 
See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
of Operations."" The Company intends to use the remaining proceeds from the sale
of the Common Stock offered hereby to finance the Company's ongoing working 
capital needs. These working capital needs include financing growth in the 
Company's accounts receivable and financing increased selling, general and 
administrative expenses necessary to generate and sustain the organizational 
infrastructure necessary to serve new and existing clients. 

Exact application of the net proceeds and timing of use will vary depending on 
numerous factors, including market and technological developments and 
competitive pressures. Due to the number and variability of factors that may 
affect the Company's use of the net proceeds, the Company will retain 
significant discretion over the actual application of the net proceeds.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that actual application will not vary 
substantially from the Company's current expectations. 

Pending ultimate application, the net proceeds will be invested in interest-
bearing securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government or its 
agencies."

exercised in full). 

The Company intends to use approximately $27.0 million of the net proceeds from 
this offering and the Private Placement primarily to develop potential 
therapeutic product candidates and diagnostic tests and products while 
continuing to expand its HyGenomics Database. The Company also expects to use 
approximately $4.0 million of the proceeds to further develop its HyChip Module 
and related products, approximately $1.0 million to fund expanded research into 
new applications of its technologies, to expand marketing capabilities with 
respect to its HyGnostics Module and collaborations, and approximately $2.0 
million to invest in capital equipment and lease additional space to increase 
sequencing capacity through 1998. The Company intends to use the balance of the 
net proceeds for working capital and other general capital purposes. Pending 
such uses, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds of this offering in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These amounts are 
estimates only and the amounts actually expended for each purpose and the 
timing of such expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous 
factors, including, but not limited to payments received under current and 
possible future collaborative arrangements; the progress of the Company's 
collaborative and independent research and development projects; the 
prosecution, defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual 
property rights; and the expansion of marketing capabilities."

At June 30, 1997, the Company owed $2,665,000 in principal amount under the 
Company's line of credit with Citibank, N.A. The line of credit provides for 
borrowings of up to $3.1 million and bears interest at a variable rate based on 
prime plus 1% (9.5% at June 30, 1997). The indebtedness under the line of 
credit was incurred by the Company for working capital and other corporate 
purposes, including payment of a loan from the Company's sole shareholder 
(the ""Shareholder Loan""), which had been accruing interest at a variable rate 
based on prime (8.5% at June 13, 1997, the date of repayment). The Company's 
bank line of credit is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets. 
Mr. BenTov has guaranteed the Company's outstanding indebtedness under the line 
of credit, and it is anticipated that he will be relieved of his guarantees as 
a result of the Company's repayment of borrowings under this line. See 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 

The balance of the net proceeds of the Offering (including any proceeds 
received by the Company from the exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment 
option) will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, 
including opening additional Solution Branches and expanding the Company's 
Technical Practices and sales and marketing staff. The Company presently plans 
to open a Solution Branch in Connecticut by the end of 1997 and plans to open 
additional Solution Branches in the future. In addition, the Company plans to 
use a portion of the net proceeds to expand the scope of its Technical 
Practices to address new technologies and vendor software solutions, such as 
SAP and PeopleSoft. The Company also plans to hire additional technical, sales 
and recruiting personnel to expand its client base. Finally, the Company plans 
to expand its in-house selling and marketing capabilities in order to market 
additional packaged software products to its growing client base. 

The Company believes opportunities may exist to expand its current business 
through acquisitions of local or regional competitors and may utilize a portion 
of the proceeds for such purpose. In addition, the Company may consider 
acquisitions of complementary businesses. The Company is not currently a party 
to any agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to any 
acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that any of the Company's expansion 
plans will be realized or, if realized, will prove profitable for the Company. 
See ""Risk Factors--Management of Growth."" 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its use of the net 
proceeds based upon its current plans, certain assumptions regarding industry 
and general economic conditions, and the Company's future revenues and 
expenditures. If any of these factors change, the Company may find it necessary 
or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above- described 
categories or to use portions thereof for other purposes or may be required to 
seek additional financing. Pending application thereof, the net proceeds will 
be invested in short-term, investment-grade, interest bearing securities. The 
Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling 
Shareholder pursuant to any exercise of the Underwriters' over- allotment 
option. See ""Capitalization"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting the 
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. 
The Company will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of Common Stock 
by the Selling Stockholders. See ""Principal and Selling Stockholders."" 

The principal purposes of this offering are to repay certain indebtedness, to 
obtain additional capital, to create a public market for the Common Stock and 
to facilitate future access by the Company to the public equity markets. The 
Company anticipates that approximately $5.2 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering will be used to repay indebtedness outstanding under notes payable to 
certain stockholders of the Company (the ""Stockholder Debt"") and to pay down 
certain capital lease obligations. The Stockholder Debt bears interest at such 
rates and matures on such dates as are set forth in ""Certain Transactions."" The 
Company has no specific plans for the remainder of the net proceeds but expects 
that such proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital, increased staffing expenses, increased 
promotional expenses and the purchase of additional equipment. The amounts and 
timing of the Company's actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, 
including the Company's research and development efforts, competition and 
marketing and sales activities. Pending application of the net proceeds as 
described above, the Company intends to invest such proceeds in short-term 
marketable securities. See ""Risk Factors -- Management's Discretion as to Use

are estimated to be approximately $16.6 million ($19.3 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the Offering 
of approximately $1.5 million payable by the Company and assuming no exercise 
of the Warrants. The Company also will receive $4.5 million in cash and a $1.0 
million promissory note from the sale of the Amgen Shares, and approximately 
$67,000 in cash from the sale of 25,000 shares of Common Stock to The Ohio 
University Foundation, pursuant to a stock purchase right. 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering, together with the 
cash proceeds received from the sale of the Amgen Shares and the sale of 25,000 
shares of Common Stock to The Ohio University Foundation, primarily for research
and development. In addition, the Company intends to use a portion of such net 
proceeds as follows: (i) approximately $1.0 million to pay expenses relating to 
employee benefit and retention plans relating to the Acquisition; and 
(ii) approximately $1.0 million relating to legal, accounting, and other costs 
incurred in the Acquisition and related Form S-4 registration statement. 
The Company expects to consolidate its operations in California, and, in 
connection with such consolidation, to use approximately $2.5 million of such 
net proceeds to facilitate employee relocation, and $500,000 of such net 
proceeds for other costs such as benefit costs, the consolidation of operations, 
the elimination of duplicate systems, and facilities, and other integration 
costs. The Company anticipates using the balance of such net proceeds for the 
expansion or upgrade of facilities, acquisition of equipment and for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company also may use a portion
of the net proceeds of the Offering to acquire technology rights, products, 
equipment, businesses or assets of other companies. No such transactions 
involving a material amount of consideration are being negotiated as of the date
of this Prospectus. 

The amounts actually expended for each purpose including the allocation of 
funding among the Company's research programs will depend on numerous factors, 
including any expansion or acceleration of the Company's research and 
development programs; the results of research and development, preclinical 
studies and clinical trials conducted by the Company or its collaborative 
partners or licensees, if any; the acquisition and licensing of products and 
technologies; the Company's ability to establish and maintain relationships with
corporate and academic collaborators; the ability of the Company to integrate 
the operations of Mercator with those of Progenitor; the Company's ability to 
manage growth; competing technological and market developments; the time and 
costs involved in filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and 
intellectual property claims; the receipt of licensing or milestone fees from 
any current or future collaborative arrangements, if established; the continued 
funding of governmental research grants; the timing of regulatory approvals, if 
any; and other factors. The Company estimates that, at its planned rate of 
spending, subject to the factors described above, the net proceeds of the 
Offering, together with the proceeds from the sale of the Amgen Shares, and the 
interest income earned on such proceeds, together with existing cash and cash 
equivalents (collectively, the ""Proceeds""), will be sufficient to meet its 
funding requirements for approximately the next 18 months. In order to achieve 
this result, however, the Company will need to closely manage the rate of 
expenditures for all of its research programs. Although the Company anticipates 
that such Proceeds will be sufficient to meet its funding requirements for its 
primary research programs for approximately the next 18 months, the Company will
be required to curtail the expansion of, or to reduce the level of expenditures 
for, certain of its other research programs, or to seek corporate collaborations
with respect to such programs at an earlier stage than would be required if the 
Company had greater financial resources or obtain other funding. There can be 
no assurance that any such corporate collaboration will be obtained on terms 
favorable to the Company or at all or that any such funding will be available on
terms favorable to the Company or at all. There can be no assurance, however, 
that the Company's assumptions regarding its future levels of expenditures and 
operating losses will prove accurate. Pending such uses, the Company intends to
invest the net proceeds of the Offering in investment grade, interest-bearing 
securities. See ""Risk Factors--History of Operating Losses; Anticipation of

(approximately $90.4 million if the U.S. Underwriters' and the Managers' over-
allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting the underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the 
Company. 

The principal purposes of the Offering are to provide increased visibility of 
the Company in a marketplace where many of its competitors are publicly held 
companies, to create a public market for the Common Stock, to increase the 
Company's equity capital, to facilitate future access by the Company to public 
equity markets and to repay indebtedness and fund potential investments and 
acquisitions. 

The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering to repay 
all of its borrowings outstanding under the Company's revolving credit 
agreement (which totaled approximately $16.0 million at April 30, 1997) and all 
of its other indebtedness (which totaled approximately $3.5 million at April 
30, 1997), to fund approximately $10.0 million in capital expenditures, to fund 
$2.0 million in connection with the Company's option to acquire a significant 
equity interest in a private technology development company and in which the 
Company has an existing equity investment, and for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. The Company may also apply a portion of the net proceeds of 
the Offering to construct facilities and to acquire or invest in other

 shares of Common Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be $62.3
 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated

as follows: (i) $35.4 million to repay indebtedness as set forth in the table
 below; (ii) $5.0 million to be deposited with the Royal Bank of Scotland 
(""RBS"") as additional security for the capital lease obligation relating to the
 Company's offshore seismic data acquisition vessel Simon Labrador; (iii) $18.0
 million to fund the capital expenditures required to increase the streamer 
capacity of the Simon Labrador; and (iv) $3.9 million for general corporate 
purposes. The Company operates the Simon Labrador under a capital lease with 
Simon-Horizon Limited (""Simon""), which in turn leases the vessel from RBS under 
a capital lease. Pursuant to the arrangement between the Company and Simon, the
 Company is required to use its best endeavors to obtain the release of Simon 
from all obligations in connection with the lease of this vessel. The Company
 is currently negotiating with RBS to enter into a capital lease for the vessel
 directly with RBS, the effect of which would be to release Simon from its 
obligations with respect to the vessel. The current state of negotiations 
suggests that RBS will require the Company to deposit approximately $5 million
 as additional security to release Simon from its obligations and enter into a
 capital lease with the Company directly. If RBS will not enter into a lease for
 this vessel directly with the Company or will not agree to other arrangements
 that will release Simon from its obligations with respect to this vessel, or
 if Simon does not waive its right to be released from such obligations, the 
Company will be required to exercise its purchase option under the capital 
lease, which would currently require a payment of approximately $12.5 million.
 If the Company is required to exercise such purchase option and is unable to 
obtain financing for such purchase price, the Company would be required to apply
 funds set aside for capital expenditures or other funds from operations or 
borrow funds under the Company's proposed $20 million credit facility to pay 
such purchase price. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources.""

(1) Does not include accrued interest, but does include prepayment penalties,
 which are immaterial in amount except with respect to NationsBanc Leasing 
Corporation of North Carolina. The prepayment penalty for the NationsBanc 
Leasing Corporation indebtedness is estimated to be approximately $200,000. 
(2) The exchange rate of British pounds to U.S. dollars assumed for purposes of 
calculating these amounts is $1.70 per pound. This indebtedness is comprised of
 a revolving credit facility with an outstanding balance of $7,667,000 and a
 term loan with an outstanding balance of $200,000. The revolving credit facility 
and the term loan bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%. The revolving
 credit facility is payable on demand, and the term loan matures in September
 1997. 
(3) This indebtedness is comprised of four term loans with outstanding principal 
amounts of $4,988,000, $1,016,000, $6,718,000, and $516,000, with fixed interest 
rates of 8.0%, 8.06%, 7.98%, and 7.73%, respectively, maturing July 2001, August 
1999, April 2002, and March 2000, respectively. The proceeds of these loans were 
used to acquire one Opseis seismic data acquisition system and related equipment 
and various offshore seismic data acquisition equipment. 
(4) This indebtedness is comprised of two promissory notes with outstanding 
principal amounts of $160,000 and $330,000, bearing interest at 11.25% and 
12.00%, respectively, and maturing September and October 1997, respectively.
 The proceeds of these loans were used to acquire offshore seismic data 
acquisition equipment. 
(5) Capital lease of offshore seismic data acquisition equipment. 
(6) This indebtedness is comprised of term loans of $2,679,000 and $2,000,000 
owed to Seitel by ERI maturing December 2001 and July 1998, respectively and 
intercompany advances of $2,978,000 by Seitel to Eagle. Interest on the 
$2,679,000 loan accrues at a variable rate of interest equal to 5.35% until
 December 31, 1997, increasing to 8.0% from January 1, 1998 through December 
31, 1998, and then at the prime rate of interest plus 1% from January 1, 1999
 through December 31, 2001. Interest on the $2,000,000 loan accrues at the 
prime rate of interest plus 1%. The proceeds of these loans were used to repay
 $2,000,000 of existing indebtedness of ERI and to pay consideration upon the
 repurchase by ERI of certain of its shares from Seitel. The intercompany 
advances relate to amounts advanced on behalf of Eagle for expenses incurred
 with respect to third party projects and taxes and allocable overhead with 
respect to third-party projects. These advances are payable on demand and bear
 interest at a rate equal to Seitel's cost of funds, which is currently 7.25%."

approximately $99.0 million ($116.2 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment 
option is exercised in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and the estimated offering expenses. Of such net proceeds, the 
Company will use (i) approximately $60 million to acquire up to four widebody 
aircraft and as many as three additional DC-8s by the end of 1998, which 
includes approximately $3 million for spare parts for its widebody aircraft and the cost to convert the acquired aircraft to cargo configuration if necessary; 
(ii) approximately $19.2 million to install hushkits on 12 of the Company's 
DC-8s; and (iii) approximately $9.6 million to retire all of the Company's 
long-term debt, which bears interest at rates ranging from 7.5% to 10% per 
annum and matures at various dates through March 2003. In June 1997, the 
Company began leasing an L-1011 aircraft, which the Company has an option to 
acquire at any time prior to December 1997 for a purchase price of $13 million 
less certain amounts paid by the Company during the lease term. The Company 
expects to purchase this aircraft with a portion of the proceeds from this 
offering. The Company has not identified any of the other widebody aircraft it 
expects to purchase by the end of 1998. See ""Business--Aircraft Fleet."" For a 
description of the Company's long-term debt, see Note 9 of Notes to the 
Company's Combined Financial Statements. The Company will use the remaining net 
proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may 
include payment of the S Corporation Notes and the acquisition of complementary 
businesses. From time to time, the Company evaluates possible acquisitions but 
is not currently considering any specific acquisition. The Company intends to 
invest the net proceeds from this offering in interest-bearing, investment 
grade obligations pending application thereof in the manner described above.

outstanding indebtedness under its loan agreements with Comerica Bank-- 
California (""Comerica""), of which $4.4 million was incurred in connection with 
the TeamAlliance Acquisition and the balance of such indebtedness was incurred

Company has no current plans, agreements or commitments and is not currently 
engaged in any negotiations with respect to any such acquisitions. Pending such 
uses, the Company plans to invest the net proceeds in investment grade 
interest-bearing securities. 

Under its loan agreements with Comerica, the Company has outstanding revolving 
loans, which bear interest at the bank's prime rate (8.5% as of June 30, 1997) 
plus 0.5%, and term loans, which bear interest at the bank's prime rate plus 
1.0% and become due and payable on November 15, 1998. As of June 30, 1997, 
borrowings under these loan agreements were $7.3 million, consisting of $3.8

purposes, a portion of the proceeds allocated to working capital may be 
utilized to pay a portion of the salaries and benefits of the Company's 
officers estimated to be approximately $442,000 over the twelve months 
following the consummation of this offering. 

If the Underwriter's over-allotment option in exercised full, the Company will 
realize additional net proceeds of approximately $1,397,655. See ""Underwriting."" 

The allocation of the net proceeds from this offering set forth above 
represents the Company's best estimate based upon its currently proposed plans 
and assumptions relating to its operations and certain assumptions regarding 
general economic conditions. If any of these factors change, the Company may 
find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within the 
above-described categories or to use portions thereof for other purposes. 
The Company anticipates that the net proceeds of this offering, together with 
projected revenues from operations, will be sufficient to fund the Company's 
operations and capital requirements for approximately 12 months following the 
consummation of this offering. There can be no assurance, however, that such 
funds will not be expended prior thereto due to unanticipated changes in 
economic conditions or other unforeseen circumstances. In the event the 
Company's plans change or its assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate, the 
Company could be required to seek additional financing sooner than currently 
anticipated. The Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or 
potential sources of, any additional financing, and it is not anticipated that 
existing shareholders will provide any portion of the Company's future 
financing requirements. Consequently, there can be no assurance that any 
additional financing will be available to the Company when needed, on 
commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in short-term bank certificates of deposit, short-term

percent of the proceeds of the Offering to the ESOP to acquire Common Shares in
the Offering with the balance of the proceeds initially invested in short-term
investments or deposits with staggered maturities ranging up to three years. The
loan to the ESOP will have a term of up to ten years and an interest rate equal

 to support the growth resulting from the Company's acquisition of nine branch
 locations owned by a large federal savings bank. The Company currently has 
adequate capital and desires to eliminate the $600,000 annual dividend on the

The Company intends to apply approximately $15.5 million of the net proceeds of 
this Offering to finance the installation of its new deflection yoke 
manufacturing facility in Weihai (approximately $10.0 million), and the 
expansion of its two existing deflection yoke manufacturing facilities in 
Xianyang (approximately $5.5 million in the aggregate). These expansion efforts 
will increase the Company's annual manufacturing capacity from approximately 
5.2 million units to approximately 12.8 million units. 

On December 26, 1996, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 
90% of the equity of Dnon Tech for $2.7 million and, on December 28, 1996, the 
Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 70% of the equity of 
Yantai for $2.8 million. The Company expects to consummate the Acquisitions 
contemporaneously with the closing of this Offering. See ""Certain Relationships 
and Related Transactions."" 

The Company believes its ability to accelerate its product development 
activities and to take advantage of acquisition opportunities will be enhanced 
by the additional capital from this Offering. The Company intends to consider 
the development or acquisition of other product lines that the Company 
determines it can manufacture in a cost-effective manner by leveraging its 
manufacturing expertise and efficiencies. In that connection, the Company 
intends to apply approximately $2.0 million of the net proceeds of this 
Offering to research and product development activities, including the payment 
of licensing fees to unrelated third parties for deflection yoke technology and 
the establishment of two research and development divisions. 

The Company also intends to apply approximately $1.0 million of the net 
proceeds of this Offering to sales and marketing activities, including the 
establishment of sales and marketing offices in Korea, Japan and the United 
States. At present, the Company relies on Pianzhuan Group for research and 
development and sales and marketing activities. Following this Offering, the 
Company intends to rely increasingly on its own personnel and resources in 
these areas. See ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."" 

The Company will use the remaining approximately $8.1 million ($13.1 million, 
if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of net proceeds 
of this Offering for general corporate purposes and working capital. 

Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds of this 
Offering in U.S. short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
estimated net proceeds of this Offering. Approximately $10,120,000, or 31.5%, 
of the net proceeds of this Offering ($15,088,000, or 40.7%, if the Underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) are for research and product 
development and general corporate purposes and working capital. Such amounts

Facility which was entered into in connection with the First Gray Line Acquisition

(1) Represents anticipated costs for the promotion of CCN, participation in 
trade shows, multimedia presentations, market research; the hiring of at least 
four additional marketing and sales personnel and three additional personnel to 
the Company's editorial staff. 

(2) Includes continuing enhancements of CCN and related technology. 

(3) Represents (i) the satisfaction of $623,000 principal amount of the Officer 
Notes held by Robert C. Varney, Ph.D., the Chairman of the Board of Directors, 
Chief Executive Officer and a director and Bruce E. Edgington, a director of 
the Company, including interest payable thereon of approximately $70,000; (ii) 
the satisfaction of $1,700,000 principal amount of the Junior Notes, and (iii)
 the satisfaction of $200,000 principal amount of the Short Term Notes held by 
Robert C. Varney, Ph.D., the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief 
Executive Officer and a director and Bruce E. Edgington, a director of the 
Company, including interest payable thereon. The Officer Notes bear interest at 
9.75% per annum. The Officer Notes were issued on July 10, 1996, July 30, 1996, 
September 26, 1996 and October 30, 1996, and the proceeds received by the 
Company from the issuance of the Officer Notes were used for working capital. 
The Company intends to satisfy the Officer Notes at the Closing. In connection 
with the satisfaction of the Officer Notes, the Company is obligated to issue 
to Dr. Varney and Mr. Edgington Officer Note Options to purchase up to 60,357 
shares and 112,282 shares of the Common Stock, respectively, at a purchase 
price of $4.00 per share, exercisable at any time and from time to time for a 
period commencing with the satisfaction of the Officer Notes and for a period 
of eight years thereafter. The Company will also recognize interest expense of 
approximately $12,000 relating to the notes payable and $14,000 of amortization 
of the discount (which represents an effective rate of interest of 17.8 
percent) accrued for the period June 30, 1997 to the time of the repayment of 
the Officer Notes. The Short Term Notes bear interest at 11.5% per annum. One 
of the Short Term Notes was issued on August 8, 1997, two on August 22, 1997 
and two on September 5, 1997, and the proceeds received by the Company from the 
issuance of the Short Term Notes were used for working capital and offering 
expenses. The Company intends to satisfy the Short Term Notes at the Closing. 
The Company will recognize interest expense of approximately $1,900 relating to 
the Short Term Notes. 
The Junior Notes consist of $1,700,000 principal amount of non-interest bearing 
Junior Convertible Subordinated Notes held by 25 persons unaffiliated with the 
Company and John J. Meindl, Jr., a director of the Company. The Junior Notes 
were issued by the Company during the period December 16, 1996 through February
 4, 1997, and the proceeds derived by the Company from the issuance of the 
Junior Notes were used for development and marketing of additional websites, 
CCN expansion, reduction of accounts payable and working capital. The Company 
intends to satisfy the Junior Notes at the Closing. Pursuant to the terms of 
the Junior Notes, the Company is obligated to deliver to the holders of the 
Junior Notes an aggregate of 340,000 shares of the Common Stock upon 
satisfaction of the Junior Notes. At that time the Company will also record a 
$1,700,000 interest expense for the use of these funds, representing an 
effective rate of interest of approximately 150%. See ""MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION 
AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION."" 

(4) Includes payment of salaries to executive officers of $360,000 per annum 
over the next two years. See ""MANAGEMENT -- Employment Agreements, Termination 
of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements."" 

In the event that the Company's plans change or its assumptions prove to be 
inaccurate, or if the proceeds of this Offering prove insufficient to fund 
operations, the Company may find it necessary to reallocate the proceeds within 
the categories as described or to use a portion of the proceeds to seek 
additional financing or to cease operations. Any changes in the allocation of 
the proceeds would be based, among other things, upon a revenue mix that 
differs materially from that anticipated, the timing of revenue generation and 
the acceptance of CCN, all of which affect the level of and content of 
operating expenses. 

Although the Company intends to utilize a majority of the Net Proceeds for 
repayment of indebtedness and the expansion of its sales, marketing, 
promotional and product development efforts, a portion of the Net Proceeds may 
also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to 
obtain product development rights or complementary technologies. Accordingly, 
management will have significant flexibility in applying the Net Proceeds. 
Potential acquisition candidates may include companies with a compatible vision,
 product and technology, where economies of scale and significant synergy or 
increase in distribution of the Company's products and services may result. As 
of the date of this Prospectus, the Company has no agreements, understandings 
or arrangements with respect to any such acquisitions. Investors in this 
offering will not have an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks 
of any acquisition. See ""RISK FACTORS."" 

The Company currently anticipates that the Net Proceeds, together with 
available funds will be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for working 
capital, capital expenditures and business expansion for at least two years. 
Thereafter, the Company may need to raise additional funds. The Company may 
need to raise additional funds sooner in order to fund more rapid expansion, to 
develop new or enhanced services or products, to respond to competitive 
pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies. If 
additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities, 
the percentage ownership of the stockholders of the Company will be reduced, 
stockholders may experience additional dilution and such securities may have 
rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the stockholders of the 
Company. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available 
on terms favorable to the Company, or at all. If adequate funds are not 
available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be 
able to fund its expansion, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, 
develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures. 
Such inability could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, 
results of operations and financial condition. See ""RISK FACTORS"" and 
""MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION."" 

The Net Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will
 be invested in United States Government securities or other minimum risk, 
short-term interest-bearing investments; provided, however, that the Company 
will attempt not to invest the Net Proceeds in a manner which may result in the 
Company being deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940."

Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be $57.7 million. The 
Company will use the net proceeds as follows (assuming the closing of this 
offering on September 29, 1997): (i) approximately $19.6 million will be used 
to repay and retire the term loan portion of the Company's outstanding 
indebtedness under the Credit Facility, including fees and accrued and unpaid 
interest; (ii) approximately $10.8 million will be used to redeem all 
Redeemable Preferred Stock, including accumulated and unpaid dividends; (iii) 
approximately $5.6 million will be used to purchase 466,666 shares of Common 
Stock from a former officer of the Company; (iv) approximately $3 million will 
be used to implement a new management information system and to enhance the 
Company's overall technological capabilities; (v) approximately $1 million will 
be used to fund additional capital expenditures for the new teleservice center 
in Norfolk, Virginia; (vi) approximately $1 million will be used to develop the 
new contract sales organization; and (vii) the balance of approximately $16.7 
million will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
The Company routinely evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses, products 
and technologies that would complement or expand the Company's business. The 
Company may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for one or 
more such transactions; however, it currently has no commitments or agreements 
with respect to such transactions. Pending such use, the balance of the net 
proceeds will be invested in short-term, investment grade, interest bearing 
obligations. 

The Credit Facility entered into in connection with the TA Transaction expires 
on December 31, 2001. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear 
interest at variable rates which are based upon either the prime rate or LIBOR, 
plus in either case a margin which varies according to the ratio of total 
indebtedness of the Company for the most recently completed fiscal quarter to 
EBITDA for the current and three preceding fiscal quarters, each as defined in 
the Credit Facility. The interest rate on such indebtedness at July 31, 1997 
was 7.9% per annum. See ""Capitalization"" and ""Management's Discussion and

 A Common Stock offered by the Company are estimated to be approximately $29.9
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
 Offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of Class A Common Stock by the Selling Shareholder. 
The Company anticipates that of the net proceeds received by the Company in the 
Offering, (i) approximately $21.3 million will be used to repay in full the 
Company's outstanding principal and accrued interest under its term loan (the 
""Term Loan"") pursuant to its credit agreement with NationsBank, N.A. (the 
""NationsBank Credit Agreement""), (ii) approximately $7.2 million will be used
 to repay in full the Company's outstanding principal and accrued interest (the
 ""Subordinate Debt"") to Stratford Capital Partners, L.P. (""Stratford"") and GMM
 Investors SBIC, L.P. (""GMM""), (iii) approximately $1.1 million will be used to
 repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Revolving 
Loan and (iv) any remaining amount will be used for general corporate purposes,
 including the increased working capital requirements of the Company resulting 
from its growth. 
The Company's outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan and the Subordinate
 Debt was incurred in October 1996 primarily to fund the acquisition of the 
Predecessor. Borrowings under the Revolving Loan provide working capital for the
 Company's operations. The Term Loan currently bears interest at 9.75% per year
 which is payable quarterly. Beginning on October 31, 1997, the principal amount 
under the Term Loan is payable in 22 equal consecutive quarterly installments of
 $875,000 plus accrued and unpaid interest, and a 23rd final payment of 
$1,750,000 plus accrued and unpaid interest is due on March 31, 2003. The
 Subordinate Debt bears interest at a fixed rate of 13% per year and is payable
 in monthly installments of accrued interest until maturity on October 8, 2003,
 at which time the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest is due in 
full. Borrowings under the Revolving Loan currently bear interest at 9.5% and 
are payable quarterly. Borrowings under the Revolving Loan are due on October
 8, 1999; provided, however, that the Company shall be in default if, during 
each calendar year, there are not at least two occasions of consecutive 30 day
 periods in which the balance under the Revolving Loan is zero and in which the
 Company has not borrowed under the Revolving Loan. See ""Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and 
Capital Resources."" 
Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this Offering will be invested in short-
term, interest-bearing obligations of investment grade."

Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock by the 
Selling Stockholders. The primary purposes of this offering are to obtain 
additional equity capital, create a public market for the Company's Common 
Stock, facilitate future access by the Company to public equity markets, 
provide liquidity to existing stockholders and provide increased visibility for 
the Company in the marketplace. 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for 
general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Company may also use 
a portion of the proceeds to acquire businesses, products or technologies that 
are complementary to those of the Company, although no specific acquisitions 
are currently planned and no portion of the net proceeds has been allocated for

estimated offering expenses payable by the Company) are estimated to be 
approximately $49.5 million (approximately $57.3 million if the Underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full). 

In connection with the Combination, the Company plans to use approximately 
$25.5 million to repay certain preexisting indebtedness of the Founding 
Companies as follows: (i) $14,539,000 of debt, $5,039,000 of which bears 
interest at the prime rate plus .75% and $9,500,000 of which bears interest at 
LIBOR plus 3.25%, and all of which matures in March 1999; (ii) $3,300,000 of 
debt which bears interest at the prime rate plus .25% and matures in February 
1998; (iii) $2,457,000 of debt which bears interest at the prime rate plus .50% 
and matures in July 1998; (iv) $2,311,000 of debt which bears interest at the 
prime rate and matures on May 31, 1998; (v) $1,307,000 of debt which bears 
interest at the prime rate plus 2% and matures on November 1, 1999; (vi) 
$980,000 of debt which bears interest at the prime rate and matures on October 
1, 1997; and (vii) $599,000 of debt which bears interest at the prime rate plus 
1.5% and matures on December 31, 1997. The prime rate and the LIBOR rate were 
8.5% and 5.7%, respectively, at June 30, 1997. The Company expects to use 
approximately $4.2 million to make a cash payment under applicable corporate 
law to a dissenting shareholder of Predecessor-IDG. 

The remaining $19.8 million of the net proceeds is expected to be used, 
together with internally generated funds and proposed borrowings, to fund the 
acquisition and development of additional MROP distribution and related 
businesses and for general corporate purposes, including as working capital. A 
more specific allocation between these two general categories cannot be made, 
because the portion of the net proceeds to be used for acquisitions will depend 
primarily upon the amount and type of consideration the Company is ultimately 
required to pay to make such acquisitions. While the Company is continuously 
considering possible acquisition prospects as part of its growth strategy, the 
Company is not presently engaged in active negotiations with respect to any 
particular acquisition. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends 
to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade or 
government securities."

($480,000 or 9.7% of the net proceeds) and for working capital ($400,000 or 
8.1% of the net proceeds). Debt repayment consists of repayment of (i) 
principal and interest due on bridge loans advanced in June 1996 aggregating 
approximately $280,000 evidenced by promissory notes bearing interest at 8% per 
annum through June 30, 1997 and 18% per annum until paid, and due the earlier 
of September 30, 1997 or the closing date of the Offering, and (ii) a 
commercial bank line of credit, of which $200,000 will be repaid, bearing 
interest at 3.15% over the thirty day commercial paper rate per annum due 
August 31, 1998. The bridge loans and bank line of credit were used for working 
capital. 

The Company estimates, but cannot assure, that the net proceeds of the Offering,
 together with anticipated operating revenues, will be sufficient to fund the 
Company's estimated cash requirements for at least 12 months following this 
Offering. Any additional funds received by the Company from exercise of the 
Warrants, the Overallotment Option and the Representatives' Warrants will be 
added to working capital. 

While the above use of proceeds indicates the Company's current plans, there 
may be changes due to the availability of other business opportunities and/or 
changes in the Company's plan of operation. Management is not currently aware 
of any such business opportunities or planned changes in operations. Pending 
application, the net proceeds may be invested in short-term interest bearing 
obligations."

improve the Company's facilities and the productivity of its workforce, 
including approximately $4.0 million to acquire and install a four-inch rolling 
mill, approximately $1.7 million to construct a new slip and bulkhead and to 
build a new load out system for use with the new slip, approximately $500,000 
to expand and improve the Company's pipe shop, $700,000 to purchase 
approximately 18 acres of land from McDermott, including the land currently 
leased from McDermott, where the Company's 12,000 square foot main office 
building is located, and $100,500 for an additional 10 acres from Universal 
Partners. The Company will use $6.3 million of the net proceeds to secure the

proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Until 
used, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds in money market funds,

Construction of the new slip will involve dredging to create a new slip at the 
Company's facilities, building out a steel bulkhead around the new slip and 
filling in the work area surrounding the new slip with limestone. The Company 
will also install a new load-out system, consisting of rails and skidways, that 
will be able to support structures weighing up to 6,000 tons. The pipe shop 
improvements will involve the upgrade and automation of much of the pipe shop's 
equipment, which management believes will increase its productivity and 
capacity. Management believes that the new slip and surrounding work areas will 
increase the Company's capacity for smaller structures. These improvements will 
also enable the Company to bid on projects in excess of 3,500 tons that may be 
priced at levels that warrant the expense of dredging the Freshwater Bayou 
Channel privately, if not reopened with local or state funds. See ""Risk Factors 
-- Facility Limitations."" 

The purchase price for the land to be acquired from Universal Partners is based 
upon an independent appraisal of the land, and the purchase price for the land 
to be acquired from McDermott was determined through negotiations between 
McDermott and the Company, who was represented by Mr. Berard, its President and 
Chief Executive Officer. The Company's management believes that these prices 
reflect the fair market value of such properties, if sold in arms' length 
transactions.

Units offered hereby will be approximately $6,360,000 ($7,410,000 if the
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of this Offering.
The Company intends to apply the net proceeds of this Offering, as follows:

                                                                   APPROXIMATE    OFFERINGS

    Repayment of Bridge Notes, and Representative Notes and        $2,245,000          35%
      related interest(1)........................................
    Acquisition of Software Programs.............................   1,702,000          27
    Marketing and Sales(2).......................................     750,000          12
    Working Capital(3)...........................................   1,663,000          26
         Total...................................................  $6,360,000         100%


(1) The Bridge Notes accrue interest at 10% per annum and are payable upon the
    earlier of one year after the date of issuance, or the completion of the
    public offering contemplated herein. The proceeds of the Bridge Notes were
    used for repayment of a $200,000 loan (and accrued interest thereon) made by
    the Representative to the Company in November 1996, payment of accrued
    Officer and employee salaries of $76,000, loans by Officers to the Company
    of $100,000, loans by others to the Company of $25,000 and working capital
    purposes including general and administrative expenses. The Representative
    Notes made by D. H. Blair Investment Banking Corp. and Rivkalex Corp., a
    corporation controlled by a family member of the sole stockholder of the
    Representative, in the aggregate principal amount of $605,000, accrue
    interest at 10% per annum and are payable upon the earlier of (i) the
    closing of this Offering, (ii) the closing of any other financing by the
    Company providing net proceeds of at least $500,000, or (iii) various dates
    from October 28, 1997 through February 27, 1998. The proceeds of the
    Representative Notes were used for working capital purposes, including
    general and administrative expenses. See ""Capitalization -- Bridge
    Financing"", ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
    Results of Operations"" and ""Underwriting"".

(2) Represents funds to be used to implement the Company's marketing and sales
    program, including the hiring of additional personnel, exhibition at trade
    shows and production of brochures and sales literature. See
    ""Business -- Marketing and Sales"".

(3) As a result of the Company's relatively long payment cycles, the Company
    generally applies a significant portion of its working capital toward
    financing its accounts receivable and maintaining sufficient quantities of
    inventory on hand. The Company intends to use the portion of the net
    proceeds from this Offering allocated to working capital purposes in a
    manner consistent with its past practices.

     If the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised, the amount for
which it is exercised will increase the amount of proceeds allocated to sales
and marketing and working capital.

     Until applied as set forth above, all proceeds will be invested in
short-term investment grade instruments or bank certificates of deposit. Income
received from investments or from any Warrant exercise will be added to working
capital and used to fund operations. Investment of the net proceeds in
short-term securities rather than operations could adversely affect the
Company's overall return on its capital.

     Although the Company presently has no plans, agreements or understandings
to enter into any potential business combination, it does intend to actively
seek and investigate such opportunities as they become available. The Company
would likely finance any such transaction with cash, the issuance of equity or
debt securities, incurrence of indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing.
To the extent that any such transaction would be paid for by the Company in
cash, the Company could decide to use a portion of the net proceeds from this
Offering. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""Business -- 
Business Strategy.""

     The foregoing represents the Company's present intentions and best estimate
with respect to the allocation of the proceeds of this Offering based upon its
present plans and business conditions. The Company expects that the net proceeds
of this Offering will enable it to meet its liquidity and capital requirements
for approximately 12 months following completion of the Offering, although the
Company's capital requirements are subject to numerous contingencies associated
with early-stage companies. The Company may be required to seek additional
financing in the event of delays, cost overruns or unanticipated expenses
associated with a company in an early stage of development, or in the event the
Company does not realize anticipated revenues. In addition, the Company may
require additional financing in the future to further expand its product
offerings or to make strategic acquisitions. There is no assurance that
unforeseen events or changed business conditions will not result in the
application of the proceeds of this Offering in a manner other than as described
in this Prospectus. This estimate is based on certain assumptions, which are
subject to change. Future events, including changes in the Company's business
plans, results and economic, competitive or industry conditions, may make shifts
in the allocation of funds necessary or desirable. See ""Risk Factors -- Need for
Additional Financing,"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."""

will use the balance of the proceeds to purchase all of the capital stock 
issued by Citizens in connection with the Conversion. A portion of the net 
proceeds to be retained by the Holding Company will be loaned to our employee 
stock plan to fund its purchase of 8% of the shares of the Holding Company sold 
in the Conversion. On a short-term basis, the balance of the net proceeds 
retained by the Holding Company initially may be invested in short-term 
investments. The Holding Company may also use the proceeds as a source of funds 
for the payment of dividends to shareholders or for the repurchase of shares of 
Common Stock. The Holding Company will not take any action in furtherance of an 
extraordinary capital distribution during the year following the Conversion. 

Citizens intends to use a portion of the net proceeds that it receives from the 
Holding Company to make adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage loans, 
nonresidential real estate loans and consumer loans to the extent there is 
demand for such loans and subject to market conditions. Citizens may also use a 
portion of the net proceeds to fund the purchase of 4% of the shares for the 
RRP which we anticipate will be adopted by our Board following the Conversion, 
subject to shareholder approval, and to repay some or all of its borrowings 
from the FHLB of Indianapolis. We anticipate that the balance of the proceeds 
will be used to purchase loan participations and possibly mortgage-backed 
securities in the secondary market. On an interim basis, we may use some of the 
net proceeds to invest in U.S. government securities and other federal agency 
securities. See ""Business of Citizens -- Investments.""

(1) In calculating estimated net Conversion proceeds, it has been assumed that 
no sales will be made through selected dealers, that all shares are sold in the 
Subscription Offering, that executive officers and directors of Citizens and 
their Associates purchase 170,000 shares of Common Stock in the Conversion, and 
that the ESOP acquires 8% of the shares of Common Stock issued in the 
Conversion. 

(2) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares which 
could occur due to an increase in the Estimated Valuation Range of up to 15% to 
reflect changes in market and financial conditions following the commencement 
of the Subscription Offering and the Community Offering, if any. 

The actual net proceeds may differ from the estimated net proceeds calculated 
above for various reasons, including variances in the actual amount of legal 
and accounting expenses incurred in connection with the Conversion, commissions 
paid for sales made through other dealers, and the actual number of shares of 
Common Stock sold in the Conversion. Any variance in the actual net proceeds 
from the estimates provided in the table above is not expected to be material."

estimated offering expenses payable by the Company) from the sale of 2,760,000 
shares of Common Stock offered by the Company at an initial public offering 
price of $12.00 per share are estimated to be approximately $30.3 million. The 
Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock 
by the Selling Shareholders. See ""Principal and Selling Shareholders."" The 
Company has agreed to grant to the Representatives and their designees warrants 
to purchase up to 100,000 shares of Common Stock, which warrants are being 
registered hereunder. The warrants are exercisable after one year at 110% of 
the initial offering price. There can be no assurance that all or any portion 
of the warrants will be exercised. Accordingly, the proceeds from the exercise 
of the warrants, if any, are not reflected in this Prospectus. 

The Company intends to use approximately $1.5 million of the net proceeds of 
this offering to repay indebtedness incurred to finance operations, which 
accrues interest at the 30-day commercial paper rate plus 2.7% per annum (8.31% 
at June 30, 1997), and matures in September 1999. Although it has no specific 
plan for the use of the balance of the offering proceeds, the Company will 
generally use the balance of such proceeds for expansion of the Company's sales 
and marketing activities for existing and new products, investment in new 
technologies, including product development, capital expenditures and for 
working capital and general corporate purposes, including possible acquisitions.
 The Company has not yet identified the specific amounts of proceeds to be 
expended for these respective corporate purposes. The amounts actually expended 
for each purpose may vary significantly depending on a number of factors, 
including future revenue growth, the amount of cash generated or used by the 
Company's operations, the progress of the Company's new product development 
efforts, technological advances and the status of competitive products. 
Currently, the Company has no arrangements or understandings with respect to 
any acquisition. Pending any such uses, the Company plans to invest the net 
proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment grade securities or money 
market instruments. The Company has undertaken this offering to strengthen its 
capital position by repaying all of its outstanding indebtedness and to provide 
equity capital for the execution of its strategy."

(1) In April 1997, as a result of the Private Placement, the Company obtained
    two loans in the aggregate principal amount of $1,500,000 from
    unaffiliated third parties. The loans are due on the earlier of
    December 31, 1997, or five days subsequent to the Company's completion of
    an initial public offering. The interest rate on each of the loans is 8%
    per annum. The loans are secured by a Stock Pledge Agreement for the
    Company's shares in Apollo and Apollo U.S. and by personal guarantees by
    Mel Stonebraker and James Probst. The proceeds of these loans were used by
    the Company as follows: Apollo and Reynolds working capital, $808,000;
    Sierra Materials working capital, $360,000; and general corporate expenses
    of $332,000.
(2) The Company intends to purchase certain capital equipment necessary for an
    additional production line, which represents approximately 50% of total
    capital equipment which may be purchased. Management anticipates obtaining
    additional financing for the balance of such equipment or, if available,
    using cash from operations.
(3) The Company intends to use these funds to repay certain liabilities of
    Sierra Materials which include $534,000 needed to eliminate the personal
    guarantees of the prior shareholders of Sierra Materials and to eliminate
    the obligation of the Company to make future royalty payments. See
    ""Consolidated Financial Statements"" footnote 2, Acquisitions.
(4) The Company had outstanding notes payable to Mel Stonebraker in the amount
    of $112,496 at June 30, 1997. Subsequent to June 30, 1997 the Company
    entered into an additional note payable to Mr. Stonebraker in the amount
    of $87,659. The notes are unsecured and bear interest at rates ranging
    from 12% to 25% per annum which approximates Mr. Stonebraker's cost of the
    money lent to the Company. Interest is payable monthly on the notes and
    any principal amounts outstanding are due between August 1998 and October
    1999. The Company used the proceeds of Mr. Stonebraker's loans for working
    capital. See ""Certain Transactions.""
(5) Part of the working capital may be used for Apollo marketing and sales,
    for the Pentiumatics manufacturing facility, or for additional capital
    equipment for Sierra Materials. Working capital will be increased by an
    amount equal to the expenses of the offering that have been prepaid. The
    Company had prepaid approximately $370,000 as of August 4, 1997.
  The amounts set forth above represent the Company's present intentions for
the use of the proceeds from this offering. However, actual expenditures could
vary considerably depending upon many factors, including, without limitation,
unanticipated complications, delays or expenses, in developing of
Pentiumatic's manufacturing facility. Any reallocation of the net proceeds of
this offering will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors but
will be in furtherance of the Company's strategy to achieve growth and
profitable operations, including through the acquisition of products or
businesses which are complementary to the Company's current products and
businesses. Although the Company anticipates that the proceeds from this
offering will be sufficient for twelve months, the Company's working capital
requirements are a function of its future sales growth and expansion plans,
neither of which can be predicted with any reasonable degree of certainty,
especially growth resulting from business acquisitions. The Company may need
to seek funds through loans or other financing arrangements in the future, and
there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to make such
arrangements in the future should the need arise. See ""Risk Factors.""
  Pending use of the net proceeds of the offering, the funds may be invested
temporarily in certificates of deposit, short-term government securities or
similar investments. Any income from these short-term investments will be used
for working capital."

underwriting discount and expenses of the Offering payable by the Company, will 
be approximately $45,335,000. The Company will not receive any proceeds from 
the sale of shares of Common Stock by the Selling Shareholders. The principal 
purposes of this Offering are to fund the Company's growth and expansion 
generally, increase the Company's working capital and equity base, provide a 
public market for its Common Stock, provide liquidity to shareholders and 
facilitate future access to the public capital markets. The Company also plans 
to use a portion of the net proceeds of this Offering payable to the Company to 
fund the final S Corporation distribution to the current shareholders. This 
distribution will constitute all of the previously taxed, but undistributed, S 
Corporation earnings. As of June 30, 1997, such distribution amount is 
approximately $10,500,000. The actual amount of the distribution will be 
adjusted to reflect the S Corporation's pro rata portion of the Company's 1997 
taxable income and any shareholder distributions from July 1, 1997 through the 
termination of the S Corporation status. 

Since the proceeds of the Offering will be applied over time, the actual 
expenditure of such proceeds for any purpose could vary significantly from the 
anticipated expenditures described above. Pending their use by the Company as 
described above, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds of the Offering 
in short-term, investment-grade instruments."

$12.00 per share after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering 
expenses payable by the Company. 

The Company intends to use approximately $15.0 million of the net proceeds of 
the offering to fund research and development activities, including the 
development of existing and future gene delivery systems. Approximately $4.0 
million of the net proceeds will be used for leasehold improvements to the 
Company's facilities and approximately $4.0 million of the net proceeds will be 
used for the purchase of certain capital equipment to be used primarily in the 
Company's pilot manufacturing facility. The balance of the net proceeds of the 
offering are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate 
purposes. These corporate purposes may include the purchase of technology 
assets and licenses. The Company has no present understandings, commitments or 
arrangements with respect to the purchase of any technology assets or licenses, 
and the amount and timing of these expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including the progress of the Company's research programs and its 
ability to attract additional corporate partners. Pending application of the 
net proceeds of the offering as described above, the Company intends to invest 
such proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing financial 
instruments. 

The Company anticipates that its existing resources, including the net proceeds 
of this offering, committed funding from existing corporate partnerships and 
projected interest income, will enable the Company to maintain its current and 
planned operations through fiscal 1999. See ""Management's Discussion and

(1) The products and components to be purchased are expected to include those 
contained in the computer communication and multimedia products currently 
offered and under development by the Company; the Company is unable to specifically 
identify the products or components or the quantities thereof that will be so 
purchased. Purchases may include products and components from Micro Equipment 
Corporation, a company which Alexander Remington, a director of the Company,
 founded and of which he currently acts as Chief Executive Officer, and from 
Aura. Such purchases will only be made if they are approved by a majority of
 the Company's disinterested independent directors, are on terms no less favorable 
to the Company than could be obtained from unaffiliated parties and are reasonably 
expected to benefit the Company. See ""Certain Transactions."" 
(2) The Company's existing commercial line of credit bears interest at the 
lending bank's prime rate plus 1.25% (the interest rate was 9.75% at June 30, 
1997); at June 30, 1997 the outstanding principal balance of the credit line was
 $3.6 million. (See Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.) 
The Board of Directors has broad discretion in determining how the net proceeds 
of the Offering (other than with respect to the debt repayment obligations 
described above) will be applied. In addition to the uses described above, 
proceeds may also be used to acquire businesses, technology or products that 
complement the business of the Company. No such transactions are being negotiated 
as of the date of this Prospectus. Pending use of the proceeds from the Offering 
as set forth above, the Company intends to invest all or a portion of such 
proceeds in short-term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government obligations,
 money market investments and short-term investment grade securities. 
The Common Shares comprising any and all Units purchased pursuant to exercise of
 the Underwriters' Over-allotment Option will be sold by Aura and the Company
 will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of such Common Shares. The
 Company will receive the proceeds from the Warrants comprising all Units purchased 
pursuant to exercise of the Underwriters' Over-allotment Option, or $.10 per 
Unit thus purchased. In addition, pursuant to the Redemption Option Agreement 
between the Company and Aura, Aura has the right, exercisable at its option, to
 require the Company to apply up to 70% of the net proceeds received by the 
Company from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to exercise of the
 Warrants (including any Warrants sold pursuant to the Underwriters' Over-allotment 
Option and the Representative's Option), subject to certain limitations, to 
redeem outstanding shares of Common Stock currently held by Aura at the Warrant
 exercise price. Accordingly, the Company will not retain or use for its benefit
 any of the proceeds from the sale of Common Stock as to which Aura exercises 
its option under the Redemption Agreement."

by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately $28.5 million 
(approximately $33.1 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated 
offering expenses. 

The Company intends to use $3.7 million of the net proceeds of this offering to 
fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Austin Acquisition. The 
Company also intends to use approximately $10.4 million of the net proceeds to 
repay the principal of and accrued interest on the Company's 12% Senior 
Subordinated Notes due in 2002 (the ""Senior Subordinated Notes""), $7.5 million 
of which were issued by the Company in December 1995 to provide funds for the 
Reorganization and the acquisition of affiliated dental practices and $2.0 
million of which were issued in June 1997. In connection with the 
Reorganization, the Company paid $6.0 million to Jack H. Castle, D.D.S. to 
acquire a dental practice owned by Dr. Castle. 

The Company intends to use approximately $9.5 million of the net proceeds to 
repay a portion of the total indebtedness outstanding under the Amended and 
Restated Credit Agreement (the ""Bank Credit Facility"") between the Company and 
its bank which was incurred to finance certain of the Company's acquisitions. 
The Bank Credit Facility, as amended, provides for a term loan, revolving 
credit facility and advancing term loan which expire or mature, as applicable, 
on January 31, 1998, and bear interest at variable rates which are based upon 
the bank's base rate plus a margin which varies according to whether the loan 
is a term loan or revolving credit loan. As of July 31, 1997, the interest rate 
on the term loan was 10.0% and the interest rate on the revolving credit loan 
was 9.5%. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and Note 2 to the 
Company's Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Prospectus for a 
description of the interest rate and other terms of the Bank Credit Facility. 

Approximately $4.4 million of the net proceeds will be used to retire seller 
financed subordinated debt issued by the Company to acquire affiliated dental 
practices (""Seller Notes""). The Seller Notes mature at various times from May 
2001 to August 2001, and are accelerated at the closing of this offering. Each 
of the Seller Notes bears interest at 10% per annum. Included in the Seller 
Notes to be retired is an aggregate of $943,363 of the Seller Notes which are 
convertible prior to the payment of such Seller Notes at the option of the 
holder into shares of the Company's Common Stock at a conversion price of 
$14.34 per share, subject to antidilution adjustments and automatic annual 
increases in conversion price. 

Approximately $526,000 of the proceeds will be used to pay amounts owed by the 
Company to Jack H. Castle, D.D.S. pursuant to a Deferred Compensation Agreement 
with Dr. Castle, effective as of December 18, 1995, which agreement provides 
for quarterly payments in the amount of $131,500 to be made to Dr. Castle until 
December 31, 2000 in respect of compensation not paid to Dr. Castle prior to 
the acquisition of Jack H. Castle, D.D.S., Inc. The Deferred Compensation 
Agreement with Dr. Castle was entered into in connection with the acquisition 
by the Company of the non-dental assets of Jack H. Castle, D.D.S., Inc. in 
December 1995, of which Dr. Castle was the sole owner. In June 1997, Dr. Castle 
and the Company amended the Deferred Compensation Agreement (i) postponing the 
payment of any scheduled payments under the Deferred Compensation Agreement 
until the earlier of (a) the issuance of any debt consented to by the bank the 
proceeds of which are applied to pay amounts owed under the Bank Credit 
Facility and the Interim Financing or the closing of any equity offering the 
proceeds of which are applied to pay amounts owed under the Bank Credit 
Facility and the Interim Financing and (b) January 31, 1998, at which time the 
scheduled deferred compensation payments shall become payable beginning on the 
next scheduled payment date, and (ii) deferring payment of the scheduled 
payments under the Deferred Compensation Agreement which were not made from 
September 30, 1996 until the earlier of (a) the closing of an initial public 
offering of the Company's Common Stock in which the gross proceeds are not less 
than $25.0 million; provided, however, that such payments shall only be made in 
the event the Company first pays any amounts owing under the Bank Credit 
Facility and the Interim Financing; or (b) December 31, 2000. Amounts not paid 
when scheduled under the original Deferred Compensation Agreement bear interest 
at the rate of 10% per annum. Following the closing of this offering and the 
payment of the deferred amounts, the Company intends to make quarterly payments 
to Dr. Castle in the amount of $131,500 for the remainder of the term of the 
Deferred Compensation Agreement. In the event the Underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, the Company intends to prepay the remaining 
$1.9 million balance due under the Deferred Compensation Agreement. The Company 
has obtained all consents required under the Bank Credit Facility to apply the 
proceeds of the offering as described above."

Stock offered by this Prospectus (at an initial public offering price of $10.00 
per share), after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and offering 
expenses, are estimated to be approximately $14.3 million ($14.9 million if the 
Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full). 

The Company expects to use approximately $7.1 million of the net proceeds to 
repay all bank debt existing at the closing of the Offering. At April 30, 1997,
the bank debt consisted of (i) $4,625,000 in loans under the Company's 
revolving line of credit with interest rates ranging from 8.375% to 9.25%, and 
(ii) three installment loans totaling $604,000, maturing at various times in 
1997 and 1998 and bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 9.11% per 
annum. Subsequent to April 30, 1997 and before the closing of the Offering, the 
Company will borrow an additional amount equal to approximately $1,850,000 for 
working capital purposes and shareholder distributions. The Company intends to 
use approximately $2.5 million of the net proceeds to launch the Eddie Bauer 
Eyewear collection which the Company expects to release in the Spring of 1998. 
The balance of the net proceeds will be used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. 

The Company intends to maintain flexibility in the use of the proceeds of the 
Offering (other than amounts to retire existing bank debt). The amounts 
actually expended for each use of the proceeds, if any, are at the discretion 
of the Company and may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, 
including requirements for launching new product lines, marketing, advertising 
and working capital to support growth. Accordingly, management reserves the 
right to reallocate the proceeds of the Offering as it deems appropriate. The 
Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, 
products or proprietary rights; however, the Company currently has no 
commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions other 
than those disclosed in this Prospectus. Until the net proceeds of the Offering 
are used, the Company intends to invest them in United States government 
securities, short-term certificates of deposit, money market funds or other 
short-term interest bearing investments."

plus estimated accrued interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum as of June 
30, 1997, on indebtedness incurred in the Bridge Financing. The proceeds of the 
Bridge Financing, in the amount of $1,000,000, were used for research and 
development, working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
If the Underwriters' Over-allotment Option is exercised in full, the Company 
will realize additional net proceeds of approximately $1,646,250, which amount 
will be added to the Company's working capital. 

The Company anticipates, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the proceeds of this Offering will be 
sufficient to satisfy the Company's contemplated cash requirements for at least 
20 months following the consummation of the Offering. In the event the 
Company's plans change or its assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or 
the proceeds of the Offering prove to be insufficient to fund operations (due 
to unanticipated expenses, delays, problems or otherwise), the Company could be 
required to seek additional financing sooner than currently anticipated. The 
Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, additional 
financing, apart from research payments and potential milestone payments from 
Wyeth-Ayerst and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be 
available to the Company when needed on commercially reasonable terms or at 
all. Any inability to obtain additional financing when needed would have a 
material adverse effect on the Company, including possibly requiring the 
Company to significantly curtail or cease its operations. 

Until required for operations, the Company's policy is to invest its cash 
reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate 
notes, U.S. government instruments and other investment-grade quality 
instruments."

upon numerous factors including the timing of the Company's receipt of FDA 
approval of its PMA for PREP, the availability of financing for the Company's 
anticipated equipment lease and rental programs, the level of placements of 
rental PREP systems and Fee-Per-Use SCREEN systems, the resources required to 
further develop its marketing and sales capabilities domestically and 
internationally, the resources required to expand manufacturing capacity and 
the extent to which the Company's products generate market acceptance and

may use a portion of the net proceeds for possible licensing or acquisition of 
products and technologies that are complementary to those of the Company, or 
acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to those of the Company, 
there are no current plans or commitments in this regard. Pending such uses, 
the Company plans to invest the net proceeds in investment grade, 
interest-bearing securities. The Company intends to invest and use the proceeds 
so as not to be considered an ""investment company"" under the Investment Company

its operating requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such 
additional funds through equipment lease or debt financing, public or private

 Stock offered by the Company hereby are approximately $7,873,000, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 
The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to repay the approximately
 $4.0 million in principal and accrued interest outstanding under its subordinated 
loan agreement with Sirrom. The remaining net proceeds of approximately $3.9 
million will be used, in conjunction with additional lending arrangements described
 below, to (i) purchase the Company's Gardena, California facility and construct 
an additional 75,000 square foot warehouse and distribution facility adjoining 
its existing manufacturing facility, and (ii) equip and make leasehold improvements 
to the Company's newly-constructed Tijuana, Mexico manufacturing facility. 
The Company agreed to purchase its Gardena, California facility from its current 
owners for $3.1 million. Such purchase was completed in August 1997. See ""Certain 
Transactions."" The Company has additionally determined to demolish the existing 
20,000 square foot warehouse on such property and construct a new 75,000 square
 foot warehouse and distribution facility adjoining its existing manufacturing 
facility. The Company commenced such demolition in August 1997, with construction
 of the new warehouse and distribution facility to begin in September 1997 and 
to be completed by the end of 1997. The cost of demolition and construction for
 this project is expected to be approximately $1.7 million. The Company intends
 to finance the purchase of its Gardena, California facility and the demolition
 and construction for its new warehouse facility by borrowing $3.5 million under 
a conventional mortgage loan with Sumitomo and using approximately $1.3 million
 of the net proceeds of this offering. 
The Company also plans to equip and make leasehold improvements to its newly-
constructed Tijuana, Mexico manufacturing facility, including installation of 
molding, decorating and painting equipment, improvements to support plumbing
 and electrical requirements, and office equipment and operating supplies to 
commence operations. The Company also intends to transfer a number of molding 
machines and related equipment to this facility from its Gardena, California 
facility. The Company expects that construction of its Tijuana facility will be
 completed in September 1997 and installation of new equipment and leasehold 
improvements will be completed in October 1997, with the transfer of molding 
machines and related equipment to occur through November 1997. The cost of new 
equipment and leasehold improvements for the Tijuana facility is expected to be
 approximately $6.2 million, which the Company intends to finance by borrowing
 $3.0 million under a five-year term loan with General Electric Credit Corporation,
 which the Company is currently negotiating, using approximately $2.6 million 
of the net proceeds of this offering, and the balance from advances under its 
revolving line of credit facility from Sumitomo. 
Pending the use of the net proceeds of the offering for its facilities, the 
Company intends to temporarily reduce approximately $3.9 million in borrowings
 expected to be outstanding under the Company's revolving line of credit facility 
with Sumitomo upon the consummation of this offering. Amounts repaid under the
 Company's revolving line of credit may be reborrowed by the Company, from time 
to time, based on certain percentages of eligible inventories and accounts 
receivable, up to a maximum $10.0 million available under such facility. The 
Company does not anticipate any limits on its ability to reborrow the full 
amount of repayments made from the net proceeds of this offering. See ""Management's
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations --
 Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 
The Sirrom subordinated loan matures in September 2001, subject to certain 
mandatory prepayments, and has a stated interest rate of 13.5% per annum. The 
repayment of the Sirrom subordinated loan will eliminate the Company's current
 annual interest obligations thereunder of $540,000. See ""Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and

trade shows. Working capital is expected to be used to fund the Company's 
accounts receivable and to maintain reasonable operating cash reserves. The

There can be no assurance that the Company's actual application of the proceeds

Company will need additional capital to (i) finance the completion of its 
planned network, (ii) fund working capital needs and future debt service

more rapid international expansion, acquisitions of businesses, investments in, 
or strategic alliances with, companies that are complementary to the Company's

The cost, timing and amount of funds required for the foregoing uses of 
proceeds by the Company will be based on the amount of sales of ZstatFlu in the 
1997-98 influenza season, the anticipated inventory needs for fiscal 1999, and 
the results of the Company's research and development programs. The amounts 
actually expended for any particular use may vary significantly from the 
Company's current plans, particularly given the lack of sales history and the 
uncertainty of the Company's research and development progress. 

Inventory production costs represent the amount of such costs not covered by 
the Company's existing working capital or projected available working capital. 
Such costs also include expenditures for opening a manufacturing facility which 
are not financed through bank or other debt sources. 

Included within the expenditures for research and development for therapeutic 
products, as identified in the table, is the purchase of equipment relating to 
research and development. 

Where appropriate, proceeds of this Offering also may be used to acquire 
products or technologies that complement the Company's business, although there 
are no present understandings, agreements or commitments with respect to any 
such acquisitions. 

Any remaining net proceeds are to be used for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes. Pending application of the proceeds described above, the 
net proceeds of the Offering will be invested in short-term, investment grade, 
interest-bearing securities."

the underwriting discounts, but before deducting estimated offering expenses of 
$248,000. The Underwriter has agreed to limit the underwriting discounts to 
1.5% of the public offering price for the first 328,500 shares sold by the 
Underwriter to organizers of the Bank or their immediate families. Such persons 
have provided nonbinding expressions of interest to purchase approximately 
328,500 shares. If such persons purchase 328,500 shares, underwriting discounts 
will be reduced by, and proceeds to the Company will be increased by, $180,675. 

The Company expects to contribute approximately $11,000,000 of the net proceeds 
of the offering to the Bank by purchasing all of the Bank's common stock to be 
issued. This purchase of the Bank's stock is intended to provide the Bank with 
the capital required by regulators to commence operations. The Bank plans to 
use approximately $650,000 for leasehold improvements and related architectural 
and engineering services, and approximately $850,000 to purchase furniture, 
fixtures and equipment and other necessary assets for the Bank's operations. 
The Company expects to use approximately $46,000 of the net proceeds to pay for 
organizational expenses of the Bank. These organizational expenses, and other 
preopening expenses, are being financed on an interim basis from loans of 
approximately $835,500 made to the Company by members of its Board of Directors.
 It is anticipated that this approximately $835,500 of loans will be repaid by 
the Company promptly following the completion of the offering. Preopening 
income may offset some of these expenses. It is currently anticipated that the 
balance of the net proceeds received by the Bank will be used to fund 
investments in loans and securities and for payment of operating expenses. The 
remaining net proceeds (plus any net proceeds as a result of the exercise of 
the Underwriter's over-allotment option) will initially be invested by the 
Company in investment grade securities and otherwise held by the Company as 
working capital for general corporate purposes and to pay operating expenses, 
as well as for possible future capital contributions to the Bank. The funds 
will also be available to finance possible acquisitions of other branches or 
expansion into other lines of business closely related to banking, although the 
Company presently has no plans to do so."

Bank One's base rate from day to day that matures on July 1, 1999. Indebtedness 
under the term loan was used for the purchase of land, buildings, equipment and 
improvements to facilities, as well as other capital expenditures. At June 30, 
1997, $29.0 million was outstanding under the Bank One Credit Facilities, 
bearing interest at an average rate of 8.85%, and approximately $7.7 million 
was available for drawdown under the revolving facility. 

The Company has three term loans with the Bank of Scotland: a June 7, 1996 loan,
 a September 19, 1994 loan and a December 12, 1991 loan. Each loan has a 120-
month maturity. The June 7, 1996 and September 19, 1994 loans each bear interest
 at 1.75% over the Bank of Scotland's base rate, and the December 12, 1991 loan 
bears interest at 1.5% over the Bank of Scotland's base rate. Indebtedness 
under the Bank of Scotland term loans was used for the purchase of land and 
buildings and to improve the Company's Aberdeen manufacturing facilities. At 
June 30, 1997, $700,000, $600,000 and $1.7 million were outstanding under the 
Bank of Scotland term loans, respectively. See ""Management's Discussion and

Approximately $20.0 million of the net proceeds will be used to pay down indebtedness under the Maxtor Notes, which are payable in three equal installments on June 10, 1999, June 10, 2000 and June 10, 2001 and currently bear interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 9.7% per annum. See ""Certain Transactions."" The Company also intends to repay all of its outstanding bank borrowings, which it currently anticipates will be approximately $19.0 million upon completion of this Offering. Such bank borrowings bear interest at either the prime rate plus 
1.5% or LIBOR plus 2.25% and mature in June 2001. At July 31, 1997, the amount 
of such bank borrowings outstanding was approximately $7.5 million. See

corporate purposes, including working capital. A portion of the proceeds may 
also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products, to 
obtain the right to use complementary technologies or to expand operations into 
new geographic regions; however, there are no negotiations or discussions with 
respect to any such transactions at the present time. Pending use of the net 
proceeds for the above purposes, the Company intends to invest such funds in

(1) Represents the repayment of $9,000,000 aggregate principal amount of loans 
from Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association (the ""Bank""), plus 
accrued interest thereon. The loans bear interest at the Bank's reference rate 
from time to time (8 1/2% as of September 1, 1997) minus 1/2%. The $6,000,000 
loan is due May 7, 1998 and the $3,000,000 working capital loans are due 
October 31, 1998. The Company used the proceeds of the Bank loan to repay a 
portion of its outstanding indebtedness to N. Herrick Irrevocable ABC Trust of 
which Norton Herrick, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the 
Company, is the sole beneficiary and Howard Herrick, Executive Vice President 
and a director of the Company, is the sole trustee. See ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- 
Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 
(2) Represents estimated costs associated with (i) conducting direct mail 
campaigns, including the costs of designing, printing and mailing member 
solicitation packages, (ii) designing and placing advertisements in newspapers, 
magazines and other publications, (iii) limited testing of other forms of 
advertising, including radio and package insert programs, and (iv) public 
relations efforts. See ""Business -- Strategy"" and ""-- Member Acquisition."" 

(3) Represents estimated costs associated with increasing online computer 
service and Internet marketing and advertisting, expanding and maintaining the 
Company's Internet web site and increasing the number of audio book titles to 
select and audio clips to preview online. See ""Business -- Member Acquisition."" 

(4) Includes costs of general corporate overhead and maintaining inventory and 
may, to the extent cash flow from operations is insufficient, be used for the 
payment of the salaries of executive officers, estimated to aggregate 
approximately $490,000 over the twelve months following the consummation of 
this Offering. See ""Management."" 

If the Underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full, the Company 
will receive additional net proceeds of $2,097,375 from the sale of the 235,000 
shares by the Company, which will also be added to working capital. The Company 
will not receive any of the net proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling 
Shareholder. See ""Underwriting."" 

The allocation of the net proceeds from this Offering represents the Company's 
best estimate based upon its currently proposed plans and assumptions relating 
to its operations and certain assumptions regarding general economic conditions.
 If any of these factors change, the Company may find it necessary or advisable 
to reallocate a portion of the proceeds within the above-described categories. 

The Company may, if and when opportunities arise, use a portion of the proceeds 
of this Offering allocated to working capital, together with the issuance of 
debt or equity securities, to expand its operations by acquiring companies in 
businesses which the Company believes will complement or enhance its business. 
While the Company has from time to time evaluated possible acquisition 
opportunities, as of the date of this Prospectus, the Company is not a party to 
any agreement, commitment, arrangement or understanding with respect to any 
acquisition. The Company has not established any minimum criteria for any 
acquisition and Management will have complete discretion in determining the 
terms of any such acquisition. 

Based on the Company's currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to the 
implementation of its business plan (including the timing and success of its 
direct marketing and other new membership recruitment advertising, member 
retention programs, as well as the availability and terms of attractive 
acquisition opportunities), the Company anticipates that the net proceeds of 
this Offering will be sufficient to satisfy its contemplated cash requirements 
for at least twelve months following the consummation of this Offering. In the 
event that the Company's plans change or its assumptions prove to be inaccurate 
(due to unanticipated expenses, difficulties, delays or otherwise) or the 
proceeds of this Offering otherwise prove to be insufficient to fund the 
implementation of the Company's business plan and working capital requirements, 
the Company could be required to seek additional financing. The Company has no 
current arrangements with respect to, or potential sources of, additional 
financing and, following the consummation of this Offering, it is not 
anticipated that existing shareholders will provide any portion of the 
Company's future financing requirements. There can be no assurance that any 
additional financing will be available to the Company when needed, on 
commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest 
bearing investments."

shares of Common Stock offered by the Company are estimated to be approximately
$28.0 million after deducting estimated offering expenses allocable to and
payable by the Company and assuming that none of the rights granted in the
rights offering are exercised and the sale of 5,915,000 shares of Common Stock
to the underwriters pursuant to the standby underwriting agreement. Estimated
offering expenses include the maximum applicable non-accountable expense
allowance to the underwriters, a financial advisory fee of 3% of the exercise
price and an underwriting discount of 4% of the exercise price. In the event
more of the shares of Common Stock offered hereby are sold pursuant to the
exercise of rights, the Company will not be obligated to pay the underwriting
discount with respect to such shares and will, therefore, realize an amount of
net proceeds greater than approximately $28.0 million. See ""The Offering--What
Happens to the Unsubscribed Shares"" and ""Underwriting.""
    The Company intends to use approximately $4.0 million of the net proceeds
from this offering to pay amounts due to CoreStates Bank, N.A. under its line of
credit. The amount outstanding under this line of credit bears interest,
generally at the Company's option, at the bank's prime rate or other short term
rates, and is payable on May 31, 1999. The Company also intends to use
approximately $4.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering to invest in
additional management information systems. The remainder of the net proceeds
will be used for continued international expansion, working capital, general
corporate purposes and other capital expenditures. The Company may also seek to
use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to expand its business
through acquisitions, although the Company does not have any acquisition
commitments. Other than to repay the outstanding balance under its credit line
and to purchase additional management information systems, the Company has not
made any determination regarding the amounts or timing of the use of any
proceeds from this offering. See ""Risk Factors--Broad Discretion in Application
of Proceeds; Acquisition Risks."" The amounts and the timing of any such use may
vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, including the Company's
revenue growth, asset growth, cash flow and acquisition activities. Pending such
uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. The Company currently anticipates
that the net proceeds received by the Company from this offering, together with
amounts available under its existing line of credit, cash generated from
operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy its
operating cash needs through December 31, 1998. See ""Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital

shares of Common Stock offered by the Company hereby, based upon the initial 
public offering price of $16.00 per share, are estimated to be approximately 
$81.2 million (approximately $84.7 million if the Underwriters exercise the 
over-allotment option in full). 

The Company intends to apply the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 
(i) approximately $7.5 million to repay the outstanding principal amount of the 
Junior Notes; (ii) approximately $3.5 million to repay the outstanding 
principal amount of the Senior Notes; (iii) approximately $1.3 million to pay 
the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock; and (iv) 
to repay approximately $68.9 million ($29.9 million of the term loan and $39.0 
million of the revolving loan) of the approximately $83.2 million balance of 
indebtedness under the Credit Facility outstanding at August 31, 1997, which 
indebtedness was used almost exclusively for acquisitions. The Credit Facility 
provides that the net proceeds of the offering be applied pro rata based on the 
aggregate amounts available under the term loan and revolving loans. The 
lenders may elect, however, to have the net proceeds applied to the revolving 
loan. If all of the lenders make such an election, the Company will apply the 
net proceeds against the revolving loan. 

The Junior Notes, which are held by Summit and Schroder, mature on December 31, 
2001, and bear interest at an annual rate of 10%. The Senior Notes, which are 
held by Drs. Poulos, Demaray and Kowalczyk, mature on December 31, 1998 and 
bear interest at an annual rate of 8%. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The Company currently maintains a $150.0 million Credit Facility for 
acquisition and working capital purposes with a syndicate of banks (the ""Banks"")
 led by BankBoston, N.A., as agent (the ""Agent""). The Credit Facility provides 
for borrowings of up to $150.0 million in the form of: (i) a term loan of 
$65.0 million; and (ii) a revolving loan of up to $85.0 million that may be 
used for working capital in an amount limited to 80% of the Company's eligible 
accounts receivable and to fund acquisitions, which borrowings may be made up 
to $85.0 million if borrowings are not otherwise used for working capital 
purposes. The Credit Facility requires the Company to make quarterly payments 
of an annual commitment fee equal to either 0.5% or 0.375%, based upon the 
Company's ratio of total debt to cash flow, of the unused portion of the 
commitment. Commencing July 1, 1998, the term loan requires annual principal 
payments of $650,000, and all outstanding advances under the term loan are due 
and payable on June 30, 2004; all outstanding advances under the revolving loan 
are due and payable on June 30, 2002. The Company has pledged its assets, 
including the capital stock of its subsidiaries, as collateral. The Credit 
Facility bears interest at variable interest rates based, at the Company's 
option, on the Agent's base rate or the Eurodollar rate plus a premium that is 
adjusted quarterly based upon the Company's ratio of total debt to cash flow. 
At August 31, 1997, $65.0 million and $18.2 million principal amount were 
outstanding under the term loan and revolving loan, respectively, of the Credit 
Facility at annual effective interest rates of 8.6% and 8.3%, respectively. The 
Credit Facility provides that the Company may reborrow funds under the 
revolving loan which it has previously borrowed and repaid; the term loan may 
not be reborrowed. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

In the event the Underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, net 
proceeds to the Company from such exercise will be applied to further reduce 
the balance outstanding under the Credit Facility."

 of $2.5 million held by the former owners of A-Y Supply, accruing interest at
 a rate of 10.0% and maturing on February 25, 2000. In addition, the Company 
expects to pay approximately $7.8 million in deferred interest and prepayment
 penalties incurred in connection with the repayment of the indebtedness described
 above. An affiliate of BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, one of the Representatives,
 is a lender under both the Credit Agreement and WCI's existing credit agreement. 
Approximately $3.0 million will be used to redeem the Company's Redeemable 
Preferred Stock held by institutional investors consisting of Apex, Bayview and

PAYMENT OF BANK INDEBTEDNESS. Approximately $10.0 million will be used by the 
Company to make partial repayment on its existing Credit Facility Agreement 
with State Street Bank (the ""State Street Credit Facility""). The Company's 
outstanding indebtedness under the State Street Credit Facility was $16.3 
million at October 17, 1997. Outstanding indebtedness bears interest at the 
U.S. prime rate plus one-half percent (8.5% at June 30, 1997). 
See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""Business -- Purchasing and Manufacturing."" 

PAYMENT OF TRADE PAYABLES TO AFFILIATES. Approximately $6.0 million will be 
used by the Company to make partial repayment on outstanding trade payables to 
the Company's current and former purchasing agents Tai Nam and Concentric Toys 
Limited (""Concentric""), respectively. Tai Nam and Concentric are owned by David 
Chu, Chairman and a principal stockholder of Toymax. Outstanding payables to 
these companies was $9.3 million at June 30, 1997 and it is anticipated that 
such outstanding payables will increase to $21.0 million as of the closing of 
the Offering. The Company will use this portion of the proceeds to shorten the 
payment cycle on products purchased from Tai Nam. See ""Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and
 Capital Resources"" and ""Business -- Purchasing and Manufacturing."" 

WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. The balance of approximately 
$4.5 million will be used by the Company and its operating subsidiaries for 
general working capital purposes, which may include strategic acquisitions. The 
Company intends to pursue acquisitions of toy companies and product lines which 
either complement or enhance the Company's current products or allow the 
Company to expand into new market segments. While the Company engages from time 
to time in discussions with respect to potential investments or acquisitions, 
the Company presently has no plans, commitments or agreements with respect to 
any such acquisitions. 

Management intends to use the estimated net proceeds as indicated above. In t
he event that the Company's plans change, or if the proceeds of this Offering 
or internal cash flow otherwise prove to be insufficient to fund operations, 
the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the 
proceeds within the categories noted above or may be required to seek 
additional financing which may be dilutive to existing shareholders. If the 
Underwriters exercise the underwriters' over-allotment option in full, the 
Company will realize additional net proceeds of $3.2 million, which will be 
used to reduce bank indebtedness. Pending application of the net proceeds 
described herein, such amounts may be invested in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. See ""Risk Factors -- Broad Discretion as to Use of Proceeds."" 

The Company believes that the net proceeds of this Offering, together with its 
existing capital resources and anticipated revenues from operations will be 
sufficient to enable it to maintain its current and planned operations for a 
period of at least 12 months after consummation of the Offering. See

Company will sell a specified minimum number of shares of Common Stock in the 
Offering. 

The Company will use the net proceeds of the Offering to repay all or a portion 
of the amount outstanding under the Company's $8 million revolving line of 
credit. At July 30, 1997, approximately $7.4 million of indebtedness was 
outstanding under the line of credit. Borrowings under the line of credit bear 
interest at the lender's prime rate and interest is payable quarterly. The 
lender's prime rate was 8.5% at July 30, 1997. The line of credit is secured by 
a pledge of the common stock and preferred stock of the Bank owned by the 
Company. Loans drawn on the line of credit mature on June 15, 1998. See 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."" The Company intends to 
contribute any remaining net proceeds of the Offering to the capital of the 
Bank to support continued growth of the Bank's loan portfolio. 

Once repaid, the unused portion of the revolving line of credit will remain 
available and the Company may use the line for future borrowings from time to 
time for general corporate purposes, including continued growth of the Bank, 
for future branch office openings and for potential future acquisitions of 
other financial institutions; however, no general corporate purpose has been 
specifically identified by the Company at this time and the Company has no 
arrangements, agreements or understandings concerning specific acquisitions."

exercised in full). The net proceeds from this offering will be used by the 
Company as follows: to fund the $10.5 million payment due to AOL under the AOL 
Contract upon the consummation of this offering; to fund the $3.8 million due 
to Excite under the Excite Contract in the next 12 months; to fund the $4.0 
million due to Netscape under the Netscape License Agreement (as defined herein)

storage capacity and other computer hardware to enable the Company to handle 
higher customer traffic; approximately $5.0 million for marketing; and the 
balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including 
possible future strategic alliances and acquisitions. A portion of the net

of Common Stock from AOL under certain circumstances and/or to secure such 
obligation by establishing an escrow account, in each case, as more fully 
described under ""Description of Capital Stock -- Registration Rights."" See 
""Risk Factors -- No Specific Use of Certain Proceeds."" 

The short-term indebtedness to be repaid is comprised of approximately 
$6 million aggregate principal amount of promissory notes (the ""Senior Notes"") 
issued by the Company in August 1997. The Senior Notes bear interest at 14% per 
annum and are due on the earliest of (i) consummation of this offering, (ii) a 
""change of control of the Company,"" as that term is defined in the Senior Notes, 
and (iii) March 31, 1998. In connection with the repayment of the Senior Notes, 
the Company will record a charge to its statement of operations in the fiscal 
quarter in which this offering is consummated. This charge will be equal to the 
unamortized portion of the discount on the Senior Notes which was approximately 
$564,000 as of October 15, 1997. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company evaluates 
possible acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, products and 
technologies that are complementary to those of the Company. A portion of the 
net proceeds may therefore be used to fund acquisitions or investments. The 
Company currently has no arrangements, agreements or understandings, and is 
not engaged in active negotiations, with respect to any such acquisition or 
investment. 

Pending the application of the net proceeds from this offering, the Company 
intends to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing instruments or money market funds. To the extent necessary to 
avoid being subject to the registration requirements of the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, as amended, the Company would invest the balance in U.S. Treasury 
obligations. Returns on such investments may be less than those that might 
otherwise result if the Company were able to use such funds immediately in its 
operations."

outstanding under the Credit Facility and any remaining proceeds from such over-
allotment option exercise will be used for general corporate purposes, which 
may include future acquisitions. Although the Company frequently evaluates 
acquisition candidates as part of its normal operating strategy, the Company 
currently has no agreements or understandings with respect to any material 
future acquisitions. The indebtedness under the Credit Facility (i) bears 
interest, prior to the consummation of this offering, at the Company's option,

with the proceeds of this offering, to the Company following the consummation 
of this offering. Until used, the proceeds of this offering will be invested in

The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering to repay 
indebtedness of approximately $21.6 million under the Company's multicurrency 
credit agreement, dated March 31, 1994, as amended (the ""Credit Agreement""), 
which will allow the Company to reborrow funds under the Credit Agreement to 
purchase and construct additional rental equipment, to expand its domestic and 
international distribution channels, to pursue potential acquisitions of 
complementary businesses and for other general corporate purposes. The Company 
currently has no agreements or understandings with respect to potential 
acquisitions. As of August 31, 1997, approximately $42.5 million was 
outstanding under the Credit Agreement (based on currency exchange rates as of 
such date). 

The Credit Agreement provides for U.S. dollar denominated revolving credit and 
term credit facilities in the amount of $23.0 million and $20.5 million, 
respectively, British pounds sterling denominated revolving credit and term 
credit facilities in the amount of $4.9 million and $6.3 million (U.S. dollar 
equivalents as of August 31, 1997), respectively, and Japanese yen denominated 
revolving credit and term credit facilities in the amount of $6.0 million and 
$1.2 million (U.S. dollar equivalents as of August 31, 1997), respectively. The 
U.S. dollar denominated revolving credit facility bears interest at the prime 
rate of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., agent under the Credit Agreement (""BBH""),
 plus 1.0% (9.50% as of August 31, 1997). The British pounds sterling 
denominated revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate determined by 
reference to the London interbank offered rate (""LIBOR"") for deposits in British
 pounds sterling plus 2.0% (9.13% as of August 31, 1997). The Japanese yen 
denominated revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate determined by 
reference to the ""Euroyen TIBOR"" rate on the Bloomberg Financial Markets 
service at ""TIBOEY"" plus 3.5% (4.06% as of August 31, 1997). The U.S. dollar 
denominated term loan bears interest at either BBH's prime rate plus 1.0% 
(9.50% as of August 31, 1997) or a rate determined by reference to LIBOR for 
deposits in U.S. dollars plus 3.5% (9.31% as of August 31, 1997). The British 
pounds sterling denominated term loan bears interest at a rate determined by 
reference to LIBOR for deposits in British pounds sterling plus 2.0% (8.44% as 
of August 31, 1997). The Japanese yen denominated term loan bears interest at 
a rate determined by reference to the Tokyo interbank offered rate for deposits 
in Japanese yen plus 2.5% (3.15% as of August 31, 1997). Mandatory payments of 
principal are due and payable quarterly on each term loan and interest is 
payable monthly or on the last day of any eurocurrency interest period. The 
entire outstanding principal balance of the term loans and the revolving credit 
facilities is due and payable in full on June 30, 2001. Until April 1, 1998, a 
prepayment penalty equal to 0.25% of the amount prepaid is due and payable in 
connection with voluntary prepayments of the term loans. The Company is a party 
to two interest rate swap agreements which fix the Company's effective interest 
costs under a portion of the Credit Agreement. See ""Risk Factors--Foreign

(1) Represents the principal amount and accrued interest at the rate of 10% per 
annum (estimated at approximately $147,000 through October 20, 1997) of Bridge 
Notes issued in the Bridge Financing in February and March 1997. The proceeds 
of the Bridge Financing were and are being used primarily for the repayment of 
certain outstanding indebtedness and for working capital purposes. The 
outstanding indebtedness repaid with the proceeds of the Bridge Financing 
included (a) approximately $171,000, plus accrued interest ranging from 8.5% to 
11% per annum, owed to several stockholders and affiliates of stockholders of 
the Company, including Neal J. Polan, the Company's Chairman of the Board and 
Chief Executive Officer, which loans had varying maturity dates and (b) 
approximately $22,000, plus accrued interest ranging from 9.5% to 10.75% owed 
to a financial institution and one individual, which loans had varying maturity 
dates. Approximately $126,000 of such indebtedness was incurred for working 
capital purposes and approximately $77,000 of such indebtedness was incurred in 
connection with the satisfaction of a consulting arrangement with a stockholder 
of the Company who beneficially owns two percent of the outstanding Common 
Stock prior to the Offering. See ""Capitalization -- Bridge Financing"" and 
""Certain Transactions."" 
(2) Includes the design and production of marketing materials, salaries of the 
Company's three current in-house sales personnel and other related marketing 
expenditures. See ""Business -- Sales and Marketing."" 

(3) Includes computer hardware and telephone switching systems, as well as 
software development costs, required to implement the Network Administration 
System. See ""Business -- The Network Administration System."" 

(4) Includes general and administrative expenses, including approximately 
$524,000 for salaries of four current executive officers and significant 
employees (other than significant employees who are members of the Company's 
in-house sales personnel) for the 18-month period following the date of this 
Prospectus. In the event the Company's proposed joint venture to establish a 
physician and hospital network is consummated, the Company anticipates that it 
will make an initial capital contribution to the joint venture vehicle in an 
amount not to exceed $250,000. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Offering during the next 18 months. This estimate is based 
on certain assumptions relating to the Company's sales and marketing activities,
 market acceptance of the Company's products, competition and other factors. 
Future events, as well as changes in economic, regulatory or competitive 
conditions or the Company's business and the results of the Company's sales and 
marketing activities, may make shifts in the allocation of funds necessary or 
desirable. In addition, the Company may seek to utilize a portion of the funds 
allocated to working capital for acquisitions of new products or other 
complementary businesses. The Company does not currently have any agreements, 
commitments or arrangements with respect to any proposed acquisitions and there 
can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be consummated. 


The Company currently estimates that the net proceeds of the Offering will be 
sufficient to fund its planned operations for approximately 18 months. However,
 the Company may require additional funds during such period in the event of 
delays in sales and marketing or product development, cost overruns or other
 unanticipated expenses commonly associated with a company in an early stage of 
development. In addition, the Company will likely need substantial additional 
financing following such 18 month period. There can be no assurance that 
additional funding will be available to the Company on acceptable terms, if at 
all. In the event such financing is not obtained, the Company may be materially 
adversely affected and may have to cease or substantially reduce operations. 
Any additional proceeds received upon exercise of the Class A Warrants will be 
added to working capital. Pending utilization, the net proceeds of the Offering 
will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated Offering expenses. The 
Company intends to use its net proceeds from the Offering (i) to repay all 
outstanding indebtedness under its Revolving Loan Agreement, which aggregated 
approximately $11.1 million as of June 28, 1997, all of which bore interest at 
the prime rate (8.50% per annum, as of June 28, 1997) plus 0.5% per annum, (ii) 
to repay indebtedness under a secured loan agreement (the ""Merrill Lynch Loan""),
 which aggregated $867,000 at June 28, 1997 and bore interest at the 30-day 
commercial paper rate (5.55% per annum at June 28, 1997) plus 2.95% per annum, 
(iii) to repay in full approximately $3.2 million in Seller Notes and the $3.5 
million Subordinated Note, all of which presently bear interest at 10.0% per

(1) Before giving effect to the receipt by the Company upon consummation of the 
Mergers of approximately $1.7 million of net related party receivables. 
Approximately $42.4 million of the net proceeds will be used to pay the cash 
portion of the aggregate purchase price for the Founding Companies at closing 
of the Mergers (before giving effect to the receipt by the Company upon 
consummation of the Mergers of approximately $1.7 million of net related party 
receivables). Approximately $4.0 million of the net proceeds will be used to 
fund S Corporation distributions to the stockholders of certain of the Founding 
Companies. Pursuant to the CFX and Alpine Gem Merger Agreements, an amount 
equal to the CFX and Alpine Gem accumulated adjustments accounts will be 
distributed to the stockholders of CFX and Alpine Gem, respectively, 
immediately prior to the consummation of the CFX and Alpine Gem Mergers. See 
""Formation of the Company--The Mergers"" and ""Certain Relationships and Related 
Party Transactions--The Mergers."" 

The Company intends to use the balance of the net proceeds (approximately 
$11.8 million) for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

In addition, the Company anticipates that, substantially contemporaneously with 
the consummation of the Offering, Jonathan J. Ledecky will exercise options to 
purchase 110,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price per share equal to 
the initial public offering price. Such exercise would result in additional 
proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.4 million, which the Company 
intends to apply to working capital and general corporate purposes. Pending the 
application of any such additional proceeds or any of the net proceeds of the 
Offering as described above, the Company intends to invest any such amounts in 
short-term investment grade securities."

(1) On the consummation of this Offering, the Company is obligated to repay the 
principal of the Bridge Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $625,000, 
plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $56,250. The Bridge Notes 
accrue interest on the principal amount at the rate of 12% per annum. The 
proceeds from the Bridge Notes were used for working capital purposes and to 
repay certain debt. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources"". 

(2) The net proceeds allocated to marketing and sales are expected to be 
applied towards the promotion of the Company's main brands in their respective 
key markets, including the United States, over the next 24 months. The proceeds 
are intended to be applied to product development, market research, point of 
sale materials, event participation and sponsorships, paid media advertising, 
distributor incentive programs and sales person incentive programs. 

(3) The Company anticipates purchasing the facilities it is currently leasing. 
See ""Business--Properties and Facilities"". The net proceeds allocated to 
purchasing the leased facilities are expected to be applied towards a portion 
of the purchase price. The balance of the purchase price is expected to be 
financed and paid over time from the Company's operations. 

(4) The net proceeds allocated to property and equipment purchases in the next 
24 months are expected to be applied towards the expansion and improvement of 
the Company's production capacity. 

(5) The Company anticipates hiring additional sales and operations employees 
and has allocated these net proceeds to fund certain incremental costs over the 
next 24 months. 

(6) $88,000 will be paid to the Underwriters pursuant to a three-year financial
 advisory agreement, all of which is payable upon consummation of the Offering. 

(7) The net proceeds allocated to repayment of long term debt is to pay in full 
the outstanding principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest of the 
Business Development Bank of Canada loan due August 2001. The loan is repayable 
in blended monthly payments of $1,200 principal and interest at a floating 
commercial and industrial loan rate, plus 2.5% per annum. The loan is secured 
by personal guarantees by Arnold Unger and Renee Unger in the amount of 
Cdn$50,000 each and a lien on the Company's assets. See ""Certain Transactions"". 

(8) The net proceeds allocated to working capital includes funds for general 
corporate purposes including possible strategic acquisitions, although the 
Company has not identified any definite acquisition candidate. 
The foregoing represents the Company's estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of the Offering, based upon the current status of its operations and 
anticipated business needs. It is possible, however, that the application of 
funds will differ considerably from the estimates set forth herein due to 
changes in the economic climate and/or the Company's planned business 
operations or unanticipated complications, delays and expenses, as well as any 
potential acquisitions that the Company may consummate, although no specific 
acquisition has been identified. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations"". Any reallocation of the net 
proceeds will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

Any additional net proceeds realized from the exercise of the Over-Allotment 
Option (up to approximately $689,377) will be added to the Company's working 
capital. 

Pending application, the net proceeds will be invested principally in short-
term certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest-
bearing investments. 

The Company estimates that the net proceeds from this Offering will be 
sufficient to meet the Company's liquidity and working capital requirements for 
a period of 24 months from the completion of this Offering. In the event that 
the Company consummates any acquisition, although no specific acquisition has 
been identified, such funds will be derived from the funds currently allocated 
to working capital or from revenues generated from the Company's operations."

The Company intends to use approximately $83.0 million of the net proceeds to 
fund the S Corporation Distribution and approximately $19.6 million to repay 
indebtedness under the Company's $125 million credit facility. The credit 
facility expires on June 30, 2002 and requires interest to be paid quarterly at 
the Company's option at either (i) the prime rate or (ii) LIBOR plus 0.75% to 
2.0%, depending upon the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio. See

discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the Unit Offering, will be 
approximately $59.4 million ($68.5 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment 
option is exercised in full), all of which will be received by Intelligent 
Polymers. Any net proceeds received from the exercise of the over-allotment 
option will be included in Available Funds. To the extent Available Funds are 
adequate, and Biovail and Intelligent Polymers agree, any additional Product 
may be included for development under the Development Contract. Intelligent 
Polymers expects to use substantially all of the net proceeds from the Unit 
Offering, less $1.0 million to be used as working capital and a reserve of $1.5 
million for possible litigation relating to the Additional Product, and to use 
up to the full amount of any additional Available Funds, if necessary, for 
payments under the Development Contract for the purpose of (i) conducting 
toxicity studies, formulation development and clinical studies for, and 
pursuing U.S. regulatory approval of, the Products other than the Additional 
Product and (ii) conducting clinical testing for, and pursuing U.S. regulatory 
approval of, the Additional Product, under the Development Contract. Such 
payments to Biovail will include an initial payment of $3.5 million for access 
to and use of Biovail's proprietary technology in connection with such product 
development and of $1.25 million as payment for the transfer of the Additional 
Product, based on Biovail's Development Costs in May and June 1997 relating to 
the development of the Additional Product. Intelligent Polymers expects that 
during the term of the Development Contract it will be engaged solely in 
development of the Products in accordance with the Development Contract and 
will have very limited sources of revenue other than the net proceeds from the 
Unit Offering and the interest earned thereon. See ""The Agreements and the 
Purchase Option -- Development Contract."" Pending expenditure of such funds, 
the net proceeds will be invested in short-term interest-bearing or other debt 
securities. Biovail's obligation to perform development work under the 
Development Contract will terminate upon the payment to Biovail of all 
Available Funds, which is projected by Intelligent Polymers to occur on or 
about March 31, 2001 (without taking into account any licensing or marketing 
income earned by Intelligent Polymers or any cash received upon the exercise of 
the Biovail Option). Upon receipt of the Financial Notice, Biovail may elect to 
provide additional funding for the development of any or all of the Products. 
See ""The Agreements and the Purchase Option -- Purchase Option"" and 
""-- Development Contract."" 

The following table sets forth the estimated schedule of expenditures under the 
Development Contract through March 31, 2001, assumes no exercise of the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option and does not take into account any 
licensing or marketing income earned by Intelligent Polymers or any cash 
received upon the exercise of the Biovail Option. The estimated schedule of 
expenditures was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a 
view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute 
of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial 
information, but, in the view of Intelligent Polymers' and Biovail's 
managements, was prepared on a reasonable basis, to reflect the best currently 
available estimates and present, to the best of such managements' knowledge and 
belief, the estimated expenditures of Intelligent Polymers assuming consummation 
of the Unit Offering. The assumptions and estimates underlying this information 
are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant 
business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause 
actual results to differ. Because of the long-range nature of the development 
plans, there can be no assurance that funds will be expended as set forth below 
and Intelligent Polymers and Biovail reserve the right, subject to mutual 
agreement, to add Products, abandon Products or reallocate funds as they deem 
appropriate. Neither Intelligent Polymers' nor Biovail's independent auditors, 
nor any independent accountants or financial advisors, have compiled, examined 
or performed any procedures with respect to the estimated expenditures contained 
herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any form of assurance on such

Stock offered hereby are estimated to be $37.0 million ($42.7 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deduction of 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by the 
Company. The Company will use (i) approximately $12.5 million to repay 
outstanding indebtedness under the Loan Agreement, dated January 23, 1997, 
between the Company and KeyBank (the ""Loan Agreement""), (ii) approximately 
$14.8 million to repay the outstanding balance of subordinated shareholder 
loans (approximately $7.4 million to each of Messrs. Kaplan and Parker) and 
(iii) approximately $50,000 to pay the S Corporation Distribution. The $9.7 
million of remaining net proceeds will be used to finance new superstore 
openings and for working capital. Pending such use by the Company, the net 
proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-term investment-grade, 
interest-bearing instruments. 

The funds advanced to the Company under the Loan Agreement were advanced under 
two facilities, a term loan facility and a line of credit facility. At June 30,
 1997, the Company's outstanding indebtedness under the term loan facility, 
which matures on July 1, 2001, and the line of credit facility, which matures 
on December 31, 1998, was $7,582,000 and $4,875,000, respectively. Each 
facility permits the Company to select an interest rate based on either the 
bank's base or LIBOR rate of interest (as such terms are defined in the Loan 
Agreement). The interest rate on the indebtedness outstanding under the term 
loan facility and line of credit facility was 7.3% per annum as of June 30, 
1997. The Company used the funds advanced to it under the Loan Agreement for 
superstore expansion and working capital. 

Historically, the Company borrowed funds from its shareholders periodically for 
working capital purposes, subject to the terms of a subordination agreement 
among the shareholders and KeyBank. The loans from the Company's shareholders 
are payable on demand and are non-interest bearing. The shareholders have 
agreed not to demand payment of the loans on or before June 30, 1998, except 
upon the date of the Company's completion of an initial public offering or 
consummation of a refinancing on a long-term basis."

after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by the Company.
 
     The Company intends to use approximately $8.6 million of the net proceeds
of this Offering for the repayment of indebtedness, including: (i) $6.4 million
for the repayment of certain indebtedness incurred under the Company's Senior
Subordinated Secured Loan (the ""Subordinated Loan""), including interest and a
prepayment penalty of approximately $63,000; and (ii) $2.2 million of certain
indebtedness consisting of $1.5 million under a lease line of credit with an
equipment financing company (the ""Lease Line"") and $700,000 under other capital
leases. The Company also intends to use approximately $422,000 to redeem a
warrant issued in connection with the Subordinated Loan.
 
     Borrowings under the Subordinated Loan bear interest at the rate of 13% per
annum, payable quarterly. Principal payments are amortized over a three-year
period, payable quarterly, commencing September 30, 1999 with payment in full by
June 30, 2002. The Subordinated Loan is required to be satisfied in full upon
completion of this Offering and will not be available thereafter. The Lease Line
is a credit facility with maximum availability of $6.0 million and is used
primarily to finance dialysis related equipment. Interest accrues at the
five-year U. S. Treasury bond yield rate plus 3.91% (9.71% as of the date of
this Prospectus). Principal and interest are amortized over a five-year period
and payable monthly. The Lease Line will continue to be available to the Company
through its expiration in August 2001. The other capital leases being paid out
of the proceeds of the Offering have similar terms and interest rates as the
Lease Line.
 
     The Company intends to use approximately $1.2 million of the net proceeds
of this Offering to fund leasehold improvements at three dialysis facilities
presently under development. The balance of the net proceeds, approximately
$11.6 million, will be used for acquisitions, de novo facility development,
working capital, including working capital for the facilities under development,
and general corporate purposes. See ""Risk Factors -- Discretion in Use of
Proceeds.""
 
     Other than as described above, the Company has no current specific plan for
the net proceeds of this Offering. The principal purposes for conducting this
Offering are to: (i) obtain additional capital to permit the Company to pursue
acquisition and de novo development opportunities; (ii) increase the Company's
financial flexibility; (iii) create a public market for the Company's Common
Stock; and (iv) increase the Company's working capital. The Company continually
reviews and evaluates acquisition candidates as part of its growth strategy and
is at various stages of discussion or negotiation with a number of such
candidates. However, as of the date of this Prospectus, the Company has not
entered into an agreement or letter of intent as to any such potential
acquisition.
 
     The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock offered hereby, based upon
the current state of its business operations, its current plans for expansion
and the current economic and industry conditions. Such estimate is subject to
reallocation among the categories stated above. The amount or timing of actual
expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including profitability of the
Company, the availability of alternative financing for acquisitions, the
Company's business development activities and competition. See ""Risk
Factors -- Need for Substantial Working Capital"" and ""Risk Factors -- Dependence
upon Proceeds of Offering; Possible Need for Additional Capital.""

to range from $29.3 million to $39.8 million, or up to $45.9 million if the 
Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%. See ""PRO FORMA DATA"" for the 
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Holding Company has applied for 
OTS approval to purchase all of the capital stock of the Savings Bank to be 
issued in the Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the 
Offerings from which it will fund the loan to the ESOP and fund the MRP. This 
will result in the Holding Company retaining approximately $14.7 million to 
$19.9 million of net proceeds, or up to $22.9 million, if the Estimated 
Valuation Range is increased by 15%, from which it will fund the loan to the 
ESOP and fund the MRP, and the Savings Bank receiving an equal amount. See 
""PRO FORMA DATA."" 

Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the Common Stock will 
increase the Savings Bank's capital and will support the expansion of the 
Savings Bank's existing business activities. The Savings Bank will use the 
funds contributed to it for general corporate purposes, including, initially, 
lending (including agricultural and commercial business lending), the purchase 
of dealer-originated automobile contracts and dealer-originated contracts 
secured by recreational vehicles, trailers, motorcycles and other vehicles, and 
investment in short-term U.S. Government and government agency obligations. 

In connection with the Conversion and the establishment of the ESOP, the 
Holding Company intends to loan the ESOP the amount necessary to purchase 8% of 
the shares of Common Stock sold in the Conversion. The Holding Company's loan 
to fund the ESOP may range from $2,414,000 to $3,266,000 based on the sale of 
214,400 shares to the ESOP (at the minimum of the Estimated Valuation Range) 
and 326,600 shares (at the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range), 
respectively, at $10.00 per share. If 15% above the maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range, or 4,694,875 shares, are sold in the Conversion, the Holding 
Company's loan to the ESOP would be approximately $3,755,900 (based on the sale 
of 375,590 shares to the ESOP). It is anticipated that the ESOP loan will have 
a 7-year term with interest payable at the prime rate as published in The Wall 
Street Journal on the closing date of the Conversion. The loan will be repaid 
principally from the Savings Bank's contributions to the ESOP and from any 
dividends paid on shares of Common Stock held by the ESOP. 
The remaining net proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially will be 
invested primarily in short-term U.S. Government and government agency 
obligations. Such proceeds will be available for additional contributions to 
the Savings Bank in the form of debt or equity, to support future 
diversification or acquisition activities, as a source of dividends to the 
stockholders of the Holding Company and for future repurchases of Common Stock 
to the extent permitted under Oregon law and federal regulations. The Holding 
Company will consider exploring opportunities to use such funds to expand 
operations through acquiring or establishing additional branch offices or 
acquiring other financial institutions. Currently, there are no specific plans, 
arrangements, agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding any 
diversification activities. 

Following consummation of the Conversion, the Board of Directors will have the 
authority to adopt plans for repurchases of Common Stock, subject to statutory 
and regulatory requirements. Since the Holding Company has not yet issued 
stock, there currently is insufficient information upon which an intention to 
repurchase stock could be based. The facts and circumstances upon which the 
Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future would 
include but are not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the 
price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the 
attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return 
and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value 
and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the ability 
to improve the Holding Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of 
dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the 
exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) 
any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of 
the Holding Company and its stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be 
subject to a determination by the Board of Directors that both the Holding 
Company and the Savings Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable 
regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that capital will be 
adequate, taking into account, among other things, the level of nonperforming 
and classified assets, the Holding Company's and the Savings Bank's current and 
projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic 
environment and tax and other regulatory considerations. For a discussion of 
the regulatory limitations applicable to stock repurchases and current OTS 
policy with respect thereto, see ""THE CONVERSION -- Restrictions on Repurchase

will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing, government and other 
investment grade securities. The Company believes that the net proceeds from 
the Offering, its existing capital resources, committed payments under its 
existing collaborative agreements and licensing arrangements, equipment 
financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund its current and 
planned operations for at least 18 months following the Offering. 

The amounts actually expended for each purpose may vary significantly depending 
upon numerous factors, including progress of the Company's discovery, research 
and development programs, the number and breadth of these programs, achievement 
of milestones under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements, the 
ability of the Company to establish and maintain corporate partnerships and 
other licensing arrangements and the progress of the development efforts of the 
Company's corporate partners. Such factors also include the pace and amount of 
any acquisitions or investments, competing technological and market 
developments that make the Company's technologies and products relatively less 
attractive to corporate partners, the costs involved in enforcing patent claims 
and other intellectual property rights and the costs and timing of obtaining 
necessary regulatory approvals."

Common Stock offered by it hereby (after deducting underwriting discounts and
 commissions and estimated offering expenses) are estimated to be approximately
 $22.7 million. 
The principal purposes of the Offering are to increase the Company's equity 
capital and financial flexibility, create a public market for the Common Stock,
 facilitate future access by the Company to the public equity markets, enhance
 the Company's ability to use Common Stock as a means of attracting and retaining 
key employees and technical staff, and provide working capital to fund the 
Company's growth strategies. See ""Business -- Growth Strategies"" and ""Business
 -- Recruiting and Training."" 
The Company intends to use a portion of its net proceeds from the Offering to
 make the Distribution to existing stockholders of the Company in an amount 
equal to the Company's undistributed S corporation earnings for the period from
 November 1, 1996 through the closing date of the Offering. The Company currently 
estimates that the Distribution will be approximately $2.5 million. See ""Certain 
Transactions."" In addition, the Company intends to use approximately $2.8 million 
of its net proceeds to pay outstanding indebtedness under a revolving credit
 facility and two term notes. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources"" 
for information regarding interest rates, maturities and use of proceeds of 
indebtedness. 
Approximately $1.0 million of the net proceeds will be used to build-out and 
equip additional Virtual Insourcing Centers. See ""Business -- Growth Strategies
 -- Develop Additional Virtual Insourcing Centers."" As of June 30, 1997, the 
Company had not incurred, or made any commitments to incur, significant capital
 expenditures with respect to the additional Virtual Insourcing Centers. 
The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes, including the expansion of its entry-level training program, working
 capital, branch expansion and possible acquisitions of related businesses. The
 Company is not currently engaged in any negotiations for the acquisition of any 
other business. Pending any of the foregoing uses, the Company intends to invest 
the net proceeds in short-term, investment grade securities, certificates of 
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States government. 
The Company will not receive any proceeds from shares of Common Stock sold by
 the Selling Stockholders."

The increase in working capital will enhance the Company's ability to obtain 
performance bonding and thus enable it to bid on larger contracts as a primary 
contractor. See ""Business -- Marketing."" The proceeds from the debentures, 
which bear interest at 10% per annum and mature on December 31, 2000, were used 
for working capital, except for $700,000 thereof which was invested in a 
limited partnership interest in Special Situations Investment Holdings, Ltd. 
(""SSIH"" or the ""Selling Stockholder""), the Company's largest stockholder. The 
Company and SSIH have agreed that, immediately following the Offering, such 
limited partnership interest will be redeemed at the greater of $700,000 or its 
market value. See ""Management -- Certain Transactions"" and ""Principal and 
Selling Stockholders."" The debentures to be repaid with proceeds of the 
Offering are held by certain limited partners of SSIH. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends 
to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing securities. The 
Company will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the 
Selling Stockholder. However, the Selling Stockholder will use a portion of
such funds to redeem the limited partnership interest as described above. See

Common Stock in the Offering are estimated to be approximately $112.7 million 
(approximately $129.9 million if the U.S. Underwriters' over-allotment option 
is exercised in full). The Company intends to use such net proceeds as follows:
 (i) approximately $84.9 million to repay a portion of the indebtedness 
incurred under the Senior Credit Facility and (ii) approximately $27.8 million
 (as of June 30, 1997) to redeem $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
 Notes and to pay the redemption premium and accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon. 
The indebtedness to be repaid under the Senior Credit Facility consists of term
 loans, which have a scheduled maturity of December 31, 2002 and September 30,
 2004. The Tranche A term loan generally amortizes in increasing increments
 prior to maturity; the Tranche B term loan is payable primarily in balloon 
payments due in 2003 and 2004. Such term loans bear interest at varying rates.
 The overall effective interest rate for such indebtedness at August 31, 1997 
was approximately 8.53%. In connection with the Offering, the Company expects 
to refinance its remaining indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility after 
the application of the net proceeds of the Offering as described above. See 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 
The Company used borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility and proceeds from
 the Bridge Financing Facility to finance a portion of the Acquisition. Proceeds 
from the sale of the Notes were used to repay the Bridge Financing Facility. 
The Notes mature on November 15, 2006, and bear interest at the rate of 11 1/8%
 per annum. The redemption of the Notes will be effected as soon as practicable 
following the completion of the Offering. Pending such redemption, the Company 
will invest such proceeds in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing 
securities or temporarily reduce its borrowings under the New Credit Facility.
 The amount necessary to redeem the Notes will change depending on the actual 
date of the redemption. Any additional amount so required will reduce the amount 
to be repaid under the Senior Credit Facility. 
The reduction in the Company's indebtedness as a result of the application of
 the net proceeds of the Offering will enhance the Company's ability to make 
acquisitions of publications and businesses complementary to the Company's existing 
portfolio. See ""Business--Business and Operating Strategy."" The Company, however,
 currently has no definitive agreements with respect to any acquisitions, nor 
can there be any assurance that the Company will make any such acquisition in 
the future."

370,000 shares to be sold in this Offering will bear their pro rata share of

indebtedness, to increase the Company's research and development activities, to 
enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, to pursue possible acquisitions, 
and to increase the Company's funds available for general corporate purposes, 
including working capital purposes. Although a portion of the net proceeds may 
be used to pursue possible strategic acquisitions, the Company is not currently 
a party to any commitments or agreements, and is not currently involved in any 
negotiations with respect to any acquisitions. While the Company intends to use 
the net proceeds it receives from this Offering for the foregoing purposes, 
other than the repayment of indebtedness, the Company is currently unable to 
specifically allocate the net proceeds among the foregoing purposes. See ""Risk

Borrowings under the foregoing bank facilities are generally used for working 
capital purposes. However, in connection with the acquisition of AME earlier 
this year, the Company borrowed approximately $900,000 under these facilities 
to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of that subsidiary. 

The Company is also considering exercising its option to purchase its 
headquarters and its engineering and manufacturing facilities in Hawthorne, 
California. See ""Business--Facilities."" If the Company elects to purchase the 
facilities, it may use a portion of the proceeds of this Offering to pay part 
or all of the approximately $3.0 million purchase price.

all the amounts outstanding (including both short and long term debt) under the 
Company's existing bank credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""), which amount 
was $38.4 million at June 30, 1997. Borrowing under the Credit Facility at June 
30, 1997 bore interest at approximately 8% and the Credit Facility matures in 
2002. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility in the last 12 months have 
been used for working capital purposes. See ""Management's Discussion and

10% per annum and approximately $238,000 will be used to redeem the Redeemable 
Preferred that is not exchanged for Common Stock. See ""Recapitalization."" The

corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and 
possible future acquisitions. The Company on occasion reviews possible

 to range from $4.8 million to $6.7 million, or up to $7.7 million if the Estimated 
Valuation Range is increased by 15%. See ""PRO FORMA DATA"" for the assumptions 
used to arrive at such amounts. The Holding Company has received the approval of
 the OTS to purchase all of the capital stock of the Savings Bank to be issued 
in the Conversion in exchange for the lesser of 85% of the net proceeds of the
 Offerings or that amount of net proceeds sufficient to increase the Savings 
Bank's tangible capital to 10% of total assets.

 the number of shares set forth below together with the amount to be retained by 
the Holding Company and the amount to be contributed to the Savings Bank.

Receipt of up to 85% of the net proceeds of the sale of the Common Stock will 
increase the Savings Bank's capital and will support the expansion of the Savings 
Bank's existing business activities. The Savings Bank will use the funds contributed 
to it for general corporate purposes, including increased local lending and 
purchases of investments, and possible future acquisitions of branches. The 
Savings Bank may also use a portion of the funds contributed to it to retire 
outstanding borrowings. Pending deployment of funds, the Savings Bank plans
 initially to invest the net proceeds in short- to intermediate-term U.S. 
Government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities. Shares of 
Common Stock may be purchased with funds on deposit at the Savings Bank, which
 will reduce deposits by the amount of such purchases. As a result, the net 
amount of funds available to the Savings Bank for investment following receipt
 of the Conversion proceeds will be reduced by the amount of deposit withdrawals 
used to fund stock purchases. 
In connection with the Conversion and the establishment of the ESOP, the Holding 
Company intends to loan the ESOP the amount necessary to purchase 8% of the shares 
of Common Stock sold in the Conversion. The Holding Company's loan to fund the 
ESOP may range from $421,600 to $570,400 based on the sale to the ESOP of 42,160 
shares (at the minimum of the Estimated Valuation Range) and 57,040 shares (at 
the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range), respectively, at $10.00 per share.
 If 15% above the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range, or 819,950 shares,
 are sold in the Conversion, the Holding Company's loan to the ESOP would be 
approximately $655,960. It is anticipated that the ESOP loan will have a ten-year 
term with interest payable at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street 
Journal on the closing date of the Conversion. The loan will be repaid principally 
from the Savings Bank's contributions to the ESOP and from any dividends paid on 
shares of Common Stock held by the ESOP. 
The remaining proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially will be invested 
in short- to intermediate-term U.S. Government and agency securities and mortgage-
backed securities. Such proceeds will be available for additional contributions
 to the Savings Bank in the form of debt or equity, to support future diversification 
or acquisition activities, as a source of dividends to the stockholders of the 
Holding Company and for future repurchases of Common Stock to the extent permitted 
under Pennsylvania law and federal regulations. Currently, there are no specific 
plans, arrangements, agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding 
any diversification activities. 
Following consummation of the Conversion, the Board of Directors will have the 
authority to adopt plans for repurchases of Common Stock or other returns of 
capital to stockholders, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. Since 
the Holding Company has not yet issued stock, there currently is insufficient 
information upon which an intention to repurchase stock could be based. The facts 
and circumstances upon which the Board of Directors may determine to repurchase 
stock in the future may include but are not limited to: 
(i) market and economic factors, such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
 the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the remaining 
outstanding shares, and the ability to improve the Holding Company's return on 
equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue 
additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee 
stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases would 
be in the best interests of the Holding Company and its stockholders. Any stock 
repurchases or return of capital will be subject to a determination by the Board 
of Directors that both the Holding Company and the Savings Bank will be capitalized 
in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases 
or return of capital and that capital will be adequate, taking into account, 
among other things, the level of nonperforming and classified assets, the Holding 
Company's and the Savings Bank's current and projected results of operations and 
asset/liability structure, the economic environment and tax and other regulatory 
considerations. See ""THE CONVERSION -- Restrictions on Repurchase of Stock."""

October 10, 1997) of 13 1/4% Discount Debentures. See ""The Refinancing."" The 13 
1/4% Discount Debentures mature on March 15, 2005 and accrete in value at the 
rate of 13 1/4% per year until March 15, 2000, at which time the interest on 
such debentures will become payable in cash at the rate of 13 1/4% per annum. 
See ""Description of Certain Indebtedness -- 13 1/4% Discount Debentures."" In 
the event the net proceeds of the Offerings exceed the aggregate amount 
required to repurchase the 13 1/4% Discount Debentures pursuant to the Senior 
Debenture Offer, any such excess proceeds will be used for working capital and 
general corporate purposes."

Stock offered by the Company pursuant to this offering are estimated to be 
$25,948,000 ($29,937,700 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Shareholders. 
See ""Principal and Selling Shareholders."" 

The principal purposes of this offering are to establish a public market for 
the Company's stock, to provide enhanced equity incentives to attract and 
retain key employees, to increase the Company's visibility in its markets, to 
facilitate future access to public capital markets and to obtain additional 
working capital. The Company will use a portion of the net proceeds of this 
offering to repay a short-term bank loan which the Company obtained in order to 
pay the estimated Dividend prior to completion of this offering. At June 30, 
1997 the Dividend would have been approximately $10.6 million, but the actual 
amount of the Dividend is expected to be materially higher. A portion of the 
net proceeds may also be used for the acquisition of businesses, assets, 
services and technologies that the Company believes would be complementary to 
those of the Company. The Company presently has no commitments or 
understandings for any acquisitions and is not presently engaged in any 
discussions or negotiations for any acquisitions. Pending such uses, the 
Company intends to invest the balance of the net proceeds of this offering in 
short-term, interest-bearing instruments. See ""Risk Factors--Broad Management 
Discretion in Use of Proceeds."""

(1) The amount set forth with respect to each purpose represents the Company's 
current estimate of the approximate amount of the net proceeds that will be used
for such purpose. The Company reserves the right, however, to change the amount 
of such net proceeds that will be used for any purpose to the extent that 
management determines that such change is advisable. Consequently, management 
of the Company will have broad discretion in determining the manner in which 
the net proceeds of this Offering are applied. 

(2) The Bridge Notes are in the aggregate principal amount of $875,000, bear 
interest at the rate of 15% per annum and are payable upon the earlier of the 
closing of this Offering or September 30, 1997. The Company has obtained 
agreements from the holders of Bridge Notes in the aggregate principal amount 
of $730,000 to extend the maturity date thereof to the earlier of the closing of
this Offering or October 31, 1997. The Bridge Notes provide for a 15 calendar 
day ""cure"" period for any failure to pay amounts due under the Bridge Notes. 
As noted in the table above, the Company intends to repay all of the Bridge 
Notes with the proceeds of this Offering. The net proceeds from the sale of the 
Bridge Notes were used for working capital and general corporate purposes and 
to pay that portion of the accounting, legal and printing expenses of this 
Offering due and payable prior to the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement. A portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Bridge Notes in 
the amount of $25,452 was paid to Leonard, Mulherin & Greene, P.C. (""LMG""), a 
public accounting firm that provides accounting services to Omega pursuant to a 
consulting agreement. See ""Management's Plan of Operation-- Liquidity and 
Capital Resources"" and ""Management--Consultants."" Dr. Glovsky, Dr. Bellavia and 
Dr. Grove, each a director of the Company, will receive an aggregate of $105,000
in payment of the Bridge Notes that they purchased from the Company. 
See ""Certain Transactions."" 

In June 1997, the Omega Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to 
$150,000 of Interim Notes to finance, in part, Omega's operations pending 
closing of this Offering and in August 1997 increased the authorization to 
$250,000. As of the date of this Prospectus, Interim Notes in the aggregate 
principal amount of $210,000 have been issued. The Interim Notes bear interest 
at the rate of 16% per annum and are payable upon the earlier of the closing of 
this Offering or June 30, 1998. Dr. Glovsky and Dr. Grove will receive an 
aggregate of $110,000 in payment of the Interim Notes that they purchased from 
the Company. See ""Certain Transactions."" The Company is authorized to issue up 
to an additional $40,000 of Interim Notes, and purchasers of such additional 
Interim Notes (if any are issued prior to the closing of this Offering) may 
include Dr. Glovsky and one or more other persons or entities affiliated with 
the Company. 

(3) The Company plans to consummate the Acquisitions concurrently with the 
closing of this Offering. In connection with the Acquisitions, the Company will 
acquire the equity interests in the Initial MSOs associated with the seven 
Initial Orthodontic Affiliates (except in the case of two sole proprietorships 
where it will acquire certain assets of such proprietorships). The costs of the 
Acquisitions will be paid through a combination of (i) cash aggregating 
approximately $2,111,800, (ii) five year 8.5% notes aggregating approximately 
$142,500, (iii) 465,314 shares of Common Stock of the Company and (iv) an option
to acquire 83,333 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the 
initial public offering price per share. See ""Management's Plan of Operation."" 
Dr. Grove, one of the Company's directors, has agreed to sell substantially all 
of the assets of his practice (which will include leasehold improvements, 
fixtures, furniture, furnishings, equipment, inventory, supplies and 
intangibles) to the Company concurrently with the closing of this Offering and, 
in partial consideration therefor, will receive $333,567 of the net proceeds of 
this Offering and 129,721 shares of Common Stock of the Company. See ""Certain 
Transactions."" 

(4) The Company plans to enter into Affiliation Agreements and Management 
Service Agreements with up to an additional 24 Orthodontic Affiliates during 
the 12 months following the closing of this Offering. Pursuant to the 
Affiliation Agreement, the Affiliated Orthodontist will typically convert his 
existing professional corporation into a general corporation that will function 
as the MSO and create a new professional corporation (the Orthodontic Affiliate)
through which the Affiliated Orthodontist will continue to provide orthodontic 
care. The MSO will retain certain assets and liabilities which will typically 
include the lease for the Orthodontic Affiliate's office space, clinical 
supplies and equipment and office furniture, supplies and equipment. 
The Orthodontic Affiliate will retain certain other assets and liabilities 
(if any) which will typically include all cash and cash equivalents, real 
property, automobiles, patient records, related patient information and notes 
payable unrelated to assets purchased. The Company will generally acquire all 
of the equity interests of the MSO from the Affiliated Orthodontist, the 
purchase price for which is determined through an assessment of immediate and 
future return on investment. The MSO typically is acquired for a combination of 
cash, five year notes and unregistered Common Stock or stock options. 
The average MSO purchase price is expected to be approximately $600,000, of 
which the cash portion is expected to be approximately $200,000. 
See ""Management's Plan of Operation."" 

(5) The Company plans to develop or acquire certain software for use by 
Orthodontic Affiliates in implementing the Model and estimates that development 
or acquisition costs will be approximately $200,000. 

(6) The remaining portion of the net proceeds will be allocated to working 
capital and will be used by the Company to fund operations as required, 
including amounts required to pay non-affiliated consultant and professional 
fees, office-related expenses and other corporate expenses, including the 
leasing of office space in Massachusetts where the Company intends to locate its
financial operations and staff. See ""Management's Plan of Operation--Plan of 
Operation"" and ""Business--Facilities."" The additional net proceeds received from
the exercise of the Over-allotment Option, if any, will be used for working 
capital and general corporate purposes. 

The Company anticipates, based on current plans and assumptions relating to its 
operations, that the net proceeds of this Offering, together with net cash from 
operations, should be sufficient to satisfy the Company's cash requirements for 
at least the 12 months after the date of this Prospectus. The Company's future 
liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors, 
including the availability of orthodontic practices meeting the Company's 
affiliation criteria, the extent to which the Orthodontic Affiliates gain market
acceptance, marketing activities and competition. There can be no assurance that
additional capital, if needed, will be available on terms acceptable to the 
Company, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive
to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, will likely include 
restrictive covenants and provide for security interests in the Company's 
assets. The failure of the Company to raise capital on acceptable terms when 
needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is 
obligated to pay each of the Consultants approximately $421,000 over a period 
of three years beginning in January 1998. The Company believes that it will have
sufficient cash flow from its operations to pay such amounts, however, there can
be no assurance that the Company's cash flow will be sufficient to pay such 
amounts. If its cash flow is insufficient to pay such amounts, the Company will 
have to seek alternative financing sources which are not now available. 
See ""Risk Factors--Possible Need for Additional Financing"" and ""Risk Factors--
Risks Associated with Expansion."" Pending the aforementioned uses, the net 
proceeds of this Offering will be invested in interest-bearing government 
securities or short-term, investment grade securities."

the Offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and other 
offering expenses, all of which are payable by the Company, are estimated to be 
approximately $445.4 million (approximately $512.4 million if the Underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full). In addition, Jonathan Ledecky has 
agreed to purchase 250,000 shares of Common Stock directly from the Company in 
the Concurrent Common Stock Offering and FBR Asset Investment Corporation, Inc. 
has agreed to purchase 500,000 shares of Convertible Non-Voting Common Stock 
directly from the Company in the Concurrent Non-Voting Stock Offering, in each 
case at the initial public offering price. No underwriting discounts or 
commissions will be paid in connection with the Concurrent Offerings. Such 
purchases, therefore, will result in additional proceeds to the Company of 
$15.0 million. 

The Company intends to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the 
Offering and the Concurrent Offerings to engage in consolidation and operating 
activities, including identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition 
candidates and structuring, negotiating and consummating the acquisitions. The 
Company is not currently involved in negotiations and has no current 
commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions. The Company cannot 
assure that any acquisitions will ever be consummated. A portion of the net 
proceeds will be used to repay the indebtedness of the Company to Jonathan 
Ledecky evidenced by demand notes having an interest rate equal to 6.75%. As of 
September 30, 1997, such indebtedness was approximately $206,000. The Company 
expects that Jonathan Ledecky will advance additional funds to the extent 
necessary to pay any additional expenses incurred prior to consummation of the 
Offering. 

Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends to 
invest the net proceeds in readily marketable, interest-bearing, investment 
grade securities."

(initial public offering expenses); $600,000 (operating expenses, August and 
September 1997); $300,000 (operating expenses, October 1997); and $748,000 
(remaining on balance as of November 21, 1997). 
In the event the Underwriters exercise the over-allotment option, the net 
proceeds thereof ($2,162,700) will be used entirely for marketing, sales, 
customer service and commercialization expenses. 

The amount and timing of working capital expenditures may vary significantly 
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our research, 
discovery and development programs, the timing and costs involved in obtaining 
regulatory approvals, the costs involved in filing, prosecuting and enforcing 
patent claims, competing technological and market developments, payments 
received under collaborative agreements, changes in collaborative research 
relationships, the costs associated with potential commercialization of our 
products, including the development of marketing and sales capabilities, the 
cost and availability of third-party financing for capital expenditures and 
administrative and legal expenses. 

We believe that our available cash and existing sources of funding, together 
with the proceeds of this offering and interest earned thereon, will be 
adequate to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next 
18 months. 

Until used, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in interest-
bearing, investment-grade securities. While the net proceeds are so invested, 
the interest earned by us on such proceeds will be limited by available market 
rates. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations"" at page 23. We intend to invest and use such proceeds so 
as not to be considered an ""investment company"" under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, as amended."

offered hereby are approximately $22.4 million after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable by the 
Company. 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering to (i) repay 
certain indebtedness outstanding under Daisy's credit facility which has been 
specifically allocated to the Company, which matures in January 1998 and bears 
interest at LIBOR plus 2.5%, (ii) repay certain intercompany indebtedness owed 
to Daisy, (iii) pay to Daisy the value of its divisional equity in the Company,
 and (iv) provide working capital and funding for other general corporate 
purposes, which may include the investment in or acquisition of complementary 
businesses. As of August 31, 1997, these amounts were as follows(i) $1.5 
million, (ii) approximately $2.2 million, (iii) approximately $3.1 million, 
and (iv) approximately $15.6 million for a total of $22.4 million. 

The Company anticipates, however, that intercompany borrowings from Daisy will 
increase significantly (to approximately $7.0 to $8.0 million) prior to the 
consummation of the Offering due to the Company's increased working capital 
needs to support sales growth, and that divisional equity will also increase 
significantly (to approximately $3.5 to $4.5 million) as a result of increased 
income. Consequently, the Company expects that total payments to Daisy from 
the proceeds of the Offering will be approximately $12.0 to $14.0 million. 
Beyond the specific purposes described in (i)-(iii) above, the Company's 
principal reason for undertaking the Offering at this time is to provide 
additional working capital for the Company. The rapid growth in the Company's 
revenues has resulted in an increased need for working capital. Accordingly, 
the balance of the net proceeds from the Offering, approximately $8.4 million 
to $10.4 million, will be used for working capital to support the planned 
growth of its business and for other general corporate purposes, which may 
include the investment in or acquisition of complementary businesses."

exercised in full), assuming an initial public offering price of $17.50 per 
share and after deduction of the estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions and other offering expenses. Of the net proceeds available to the 
Company, (i) approximately $31.0 million will be used to repay all outstanding 
indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility, (ii) approximately $6.5 
million will be used to repay other indebtedness of the Company, described 
below, (iii) approximately $1.6 million will be used to fund the Williams 
Termination Fee, (iv) approximately $6.0 million will be used to finance the 
Company's investment in certain information and technology infrastructure

purposes, which could include funding the Company's cash requirements relating 
to the UPenn Contract or the Development Purchases. See ""Management's Discussion

such use of proceeds, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds in 
investment grade short-term, interest-bearing securities. Upon completion of 
the Offering, the Company intends to use its borrowing capacity, cash generated 
from operations and the remaining net proceeds of the Offering to pursue its 
growth strategy. 

Approximately $31.0 million of the net proceeds from the Offering will be used 
to repay indebtedness owed by the Company under its Existing Credit Facility. 
Approximately $30.0 million indebtedness was incurred on August 22, 1997, bears 
interest at a rate of 6.625% per year and has a maturity date of February 22, 
1998. Approximately $7.0 million of such indebtedness was incurred in order to 
refinance certain indebtedness of the Predecessor Company and approximately 
$22.7 million of such indebtedness was incurred in connection with the Doppelt 
Acquisition. An additional $1.0 million was incurred in October 1997 for 
working capital purposes. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

Approximately $6.5 million of the net proceeds from the Offering will be used 
to reduce certain indebtedness of the Company. Of the $6.5 million indebtedness,
 approximately $3.8 million is deferred compensation payables owed to former 
employees of the Company which accrue interest at an annual rate of 8.25% and 
have no stated maturity. See ""Management--1995 Profit Sharing Plan."" The 
remaining indebtedness includes approximately $1.1 million owed under various 
lines of credit (which accrue interest at annual rates ranging from 8.0% to 8.5%
 and have stated maturities extending from March 1998 to April 2000), 
approximately $0.9 million owed to former shareholders (which accrue interest 
at an annual rate of 6.1% and have stated maturities extending from January 
2000 to February 2000) and approximately $0.7 million of indebtedness owed to 
Mr. Williams (which accrues interest at an annual rate of 10.5% and has a stated
maturity of October 1, 2006). See ""Certain Transactions--Capitalization Debt."""

The principal purpose of this offering is to reduce existing indebtedness to 
provide additional capital to support the Company's continued expansion and 
growth. The Company intends to use the proceeds of this offering as follows: 
(i) approximately $5.8 million to repay the Company's current outstanding 
balance on its revolving credit facility with Richfield Bank & Trust Co., which 
accrues interest at the bank's base rate plus 0.5% (9.0% as of August 1, 1997)

Shareholder Notes, which accrue interest at 5.63% per annum, and (iii)

interest at 10% per annum and mature November 30, 2004. In addition, in the 
event that the Company declares the Second Dividend, a portion of the net

 the conversion of the Company to a C corporation, the Company does not believe 
that the Second Dividend will be material. Messrs. Dolginow and Schlosser,

The principal purpose of this offering is to reduce existing indebtedness to

(i) approximately $5.8 million to repay the Company's current outstanding

accrues interest at the bank's base rate plus 0.5% (9.0% as of August 1, 1997)

Stock offered by the Company hereby are $38.6 million ($44.4 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting 
discounts and commissions and estimated Offering expenses. 

The Company elected to be taxed as a corporation under subchapter S of the Code 
(""S Corporation"") beginning October 1, 1986, and, therefore, the income of the 
Company is attributable to its existing stockholders for federal and certain 
state tax purposes. Upon consummation of the Offering, the Company will 
terminate its S Corporation election and will become subject to U.S. federal 
and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates. In connection with the 
termination of the Company's S Corporation election, the Company will pay 
to its existing stockholders a distribution (the ""S Corporation Distribution""), 
which will be declared, but not paid, prior to the Offering. The S Corporation 
Distribution will be equal to the amount of the Company's undistributed 
earnings from October 1, 1986 to May 3, 1997 which were previously taxed to its 
existing stockholders plus the Company's S Corporation earnings 
attributable to the period from May 4, 1997 to the date of termination of the S 
Corporation election. It is not possible to predict the actual amount of the S 
Corporation Distribution at this time, because the Company's S Corporation 
earnings for the period from May 4, 1997 to the date of termination of the S 
Corporation election will be based on a pro rata allocation of the Company's 
earnings for the 12-month period ending May 2, 1998 (based on the number of 
days in the period). The Company will use approximately $32.7 million of the 
net proceeds of the Offering to pay a portion of the S Corporation Distribution 
upon consummation of the Offering, and, once the actual S Corporation 
Distribution is determined, the Company expects to use cash on hand to fund the 
balance of the S Corporation Distribution. Purchasers of shares of Common Stock 
in the Offering will not be entitled to any portion of the S Corporation 
Distribution. The Company intends to use the balance of the net proceeds to 
finance capital expenditures. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of

fund future growth, to provide capital for acquisitions and liquidity and to 
create a public market for the Company's shares. Approximately $4.3 million of 
the net proceeds of this offering are allocated to repay substantially all of 
the Company's outstanding indebtedness (which had varying interest rates at 
July 31, 1997 not exceeding 9% per annum and maturing not later than April 11, 
2000). The proceeds of the indebtedness which is being repaid were primarily 
used to refinance the Company's previously outstanding line of credit and for 
operating needs, including payments of estimated income taxes. The Company will 
be able to borrow up to $3 million under the Revolving Credit Facility upon 
completion of this offering. The Company has allocated approximately $12 million
of the net proceeds of this offering to fund its growth plans, which includes: 
approximately $8 million for capital expenditures, including the purchase of 
additional fixed-base and hand-held bingo units to be installed at existing and 
new customers' bingo halls; approximately $3 million for expanding the Company's
 operations into new markets; and approximately $1 million for launching TSBN.

urban centers; (iii) $2.0 million to increase inventories of premium cigars; 
(iv) $600,000 to expand its mail order business; (v) $500,000 for the 
introduction of new premium cigar brands; and (vi) $500,000 to upgrade the 
Company's management information and accounting systems. The outstanding 
indebtedness to be repaid with the net proceeds of the Offering includes four 
different loans with approximately $2.7 million, $450,000, $146,000 and $64,000 
outstanding, respectively, bearing interest at 6.0%, 8.75%, 8.5% and 9.0%, 
respectively, and maturing December 1, 1997, December 2008, June 2020 and April 
1998, respectively. The $2.7 million loan was incurred to finance the 
distribution to Robert G. Levin, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer 
and President of the Company, of the estimated $2.7 million in undistributed S 
Corporation earnings of Ashton Distributors, Inc. through the date of the 
Reorganization, which estimated earnings have been or will be taxed directly to 
Mr. Levin. See 'Reorganization of the Company' and 'Certain Transactions.' The 
$450,000 loan was incurred to finance the construction of tenant improvements

'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources.' 

The remainder of the net proceeds of the Offering, approximately $7.8 million, 
will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital to 
support the growth of the Company business. In lieu of establishing new retail 
stores, as described in (i) above, the Company may elect to acquire existing 
retail locations and, to the extent such stores are acquired rather than 
established, the Company anticipates that the cost to acquire a store will be 
substantially greater than the $1.3 million allocated to establish a store. The 
Company may use approximately $450,000 of the proceeds of the Offering to make 
a contribution to a proposed joint venture. See 'Business -- Marketing and 
Distribution -- Retail Store.' In addition, a portion of the net proceeds may 
also be used for acquisition of proprietary cigar brands and existing 
distributors of premium cigars. The Company currently has no agreements with 
respect to the acquisition of any retail store, cigar brand or distributor. 

Pending application of the net proceeds of the Company from the Offering, the 
Company intends to invest in interest-bearing bank accounts, short-term, 
investment grade securities or guaranteed obligations of the United States

The Company's business strategy envisions that the Company will build out its 
existing clusters, construct new clusters and interconnect its clusters, which 
will require substantial additional capital in addition to the capital raised 
in this Offering. The Company expects to meet such additional capital needs with
 the proceeds from the Credit Facility, together with internally generated cash 
flow and lease arrangements, proceeds from other bank credit facilities, other 
borrowings and possible issuances of additional equity securities. 

Because of the number and variability of factors that determine the Company's 
use of the net proceeds of the Offering, management will retain discretion over 
the application of net proceeds. There can be no assurance that such 
application will not vary from the Company's current plans. In addition, there

sufficient capital to enable it to fully realize all of its strategic 
objectives. See ""Risk Factors--Significant Capital Expenditures"" and ""--Risks

September 27, 1997, the Company had $5.8 million outstanding under its credit 
facility, which includes $3.0 million outstanding under its revolving credit

option, as currently structured, will not be available following completion of 
this offering. As of November 7, 1997, the interest rate payable by the Company 
indexed to the London or Nassau Interbank rates was 6.53%. This rate applied to 
$5,000,000 of the Company's indebtedness under its credit facility. The 
additional indebtedness under its credit facility bore interest at 8.25% as of 
November 7, 1997. Repayment of amounts outstanding under the line of credit will
not reduce the total amount available for borrowing under the line of credit.

after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and offering expenses 
payable by the Company. 

Approximately $14.8 million of the net proceeds to the Company will be used to 
repay a portion of the borrowings of the Company incurred under its credit 
facility (the ""Credit Facility"") and $0.2 million for unrelated term debt. The 
Credit Facility bears interest per annum at varying rates of LIBOR plus a 
margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.00% or the prime rate plus .50%. The Credit 
Facility has a five year term. The Credit Facility was used to finance an 
aggregate of $9.0 million for the Company's acquisitions of LaValley and SEFCO.
 In addition, approximately $6.7 million of the net proceeds will be used to 
repay the Company's outstanding indebtedness to Owens Corning, which 
indebtedness was incurred in connection with the Company's acquisition of the 
fiberglass composite UST business of Owens Corning. The indebtedness to Owens 
Corning bears interest at 10.0% per annum and is scheduled to mature on 
December 31, 1999. Approximately $1.1 million (including accrued interest) of 
the net proceeds will be used to repay the Company's outstanding indebtedness 
to Praxair, Inc., which indebtedness was incurred in connection with the 
acquisition of Ershigs. The indebtedness to Praxair, Inc. bears interest at a 
rate of 10.0% per annum and is scheduled to mature in February 1998. A portion 
of the proceeds equal to approximately $1.4 million will be used to redeem all 
of the shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock (including accrued and 
unpaid dividends through the date of redemption). The Company's Directors 
beneficially own approximately 75% of the Series A Preferred Stock. The 
remaining net proceeds, if any, are intended to be used by the Company for 
general working capital purposes. See ""Business -- Business Strategy."""

The Company intends to use the net proceeds to repay indebtedness outstanding

the Term Loan Facility, $7.1 million outstanding under the Vendor Financing, 
$12.7 million outstanding under the Other Notes, and $11.1 million to be repaid 
under the Term Loan due 2001. Such borrowings bore interest as of such date at 
a weighted average interest rate of 8.20%, 7.91%, 
8.48% and 7.47%, respectively. All such borrowings were incurred to finance the 
Cherokee Acquisition or the modernization of the Company's manufacturing and

Stock to Japan Tobacco are estimated to be approximately $24,720,000 
($28,068,000 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), 
at the initial public offering price of $8.00 per share, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by the Company. 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of 
shares to Japan Tobacco as follows: approximately $2,000,000 to fund tenant 
improvements; approximately $10,000,000 to fund capital expenditures; and the 
remainder to fund its research and development activities, including scale-up 
of its laboratory, database and business development operations, and for 
working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company's management will 
retain broad discretion in the allocation of such net proceeds. The Company may 
also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund acquisitions of complementary 
technologies, products or businesses, although the Company has no current 
agreements or commitments for any such acquisitions. Pending such uses, the 
Company intends to invest the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of 
shares to Japan Tobacco in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade 
securities. 

The amounts actually expended for each purpose may vary significantly 
depending upon numerous factors, including progress of the Company's programs, 
the number and breadth of these programs, future revenue growth, if any, 
achievement of milestones under strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, 
the ability of the Company to establish and maintain strategic alliances and 
other arrangements, the progress of the development efforts of the Company's 
strategic partners and the amount of cash, if any, generated by the Company's 
operations. Such factors also include the pace and amount of any acquisitions 
or investments, competing technological and market developments that make the 
Company's technologies and database products relatively less attractive to 
strategic partners and the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other 
intellectual property rights. 

The Company believes that its existing capital resources, together with the net 
proceeds from this offering and the sale of shares to Japan Tobacco, interest 
income and future payments due under its existing strategic alliances, will be 
sufficient to satisfy its current and projected funding requirements for at 
least the next 24 months. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial

Stock offered hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
and estimated Offering and Merger expenses, are estimated to be $33.2 million 
($38.8 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). 

Of the net proceeds, $18.1 million or approximately 54% will be used to pay the 
cash portion of the purchase price for the Founding Companies, some of which 
will be paid to persons who will become directors of the Company or will become 
holders of more than 5% of the Common Stock. In addition, $1.3 million of the 
net proceeds will be used to pay the portion of the $6.9 million Owners' 
Distributions which would not have been funded through the Founding Companies' 
existing cash balances had the distribution been made as of September 30, 1997. 

The remaining net proceeds from this Offering, which are estimated to be 
approximately $13.9 million, will be used, together with borrowings available 
from the Company's revolving credit facilities discussed below, to repay the 
$1.7 million of the long-term debt of the Founding Companies and for working 
capital and acquisitions. Management will have substantial discretion over the 
use of the funds intended to be used for working capital and acquisitions, and 
may use these funds for other corporate purposes. The Founding Companies also 
had approximately $38.8 million of floor plan financing as of September 30, 1997 
which will be refinanced from the revolving credit facilities. The portion of 
this $41.9 million debt that was incurred during 1996 was $38.1 million and the 
use of proceeds for such debt was to finance the opening of new sales centers 
and to provide working capital. Approximately $37.1 million of the $41.9 
million has been personally guaranteed by stockholders of the Founding 
Companies who will become officers, directors or beneficial owners of 5% or 
more of the Company's Common Stock upon consummation of the Offering. Such 
indebtedness bore interest at a weighted average per annum interest rate of 
9.9% in 1996 and matures at varying dates through September 2003. The remaining 
indebtedness bore interest at a per annum interest rate of 8.5% in 1996 and 
matures at various dates through November 1998. 

The Company has obtained commitments from two financial institutions for lines 
of credit totaling $125 million for floor plan financing, and has a commitment 
from a bank for a $20 million credit facility and is currently undertaking a 
syndication for an additional $30 million credit facility for working capital 
and acquisitions. These revolving credit facilities are expected to be entered 
into following consummation of the Offering, and the Company intends to 
refinance all of the Founding Companies' floor plan debt. The floor plan 
portion of the credit facility may be used only to finance the purchase of 
manufactured homes, and borrowings may not exceed the total purchase price of 
the homes financed. The credit facilities will bear interest at various rates 
not exceeding the prime rate. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of

     The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering for (i)
approximately $2.0 million of start-up and other funding costs related to the
expansion of the Company's contract sales operations into the United States,
(ii) approximately $1.3 million of capital expenditures associated with the

The Company intends to use approximately $3.0 million of the net proceeds to 
fund a planned expansion of its primary manufacturing facility, $1.0 million to 
construct, lease or purchase additional facilities and equipment to diversify 
its manufacturing capability to include five-strand leader wire and telemetric 
cable and $1.5 million to repay short-term debt. The Company intends to use the

corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions. 

All of the $1.5 million in short-term debt to be repaid from the net proceeds of
the Offering was incurred in connection with the purchase by the Company of 
real properties from affiliates of OYO Japan in September 1997. This debt bears 
interest at a variable LIBOR-based rate (6.2% as of October 31, 1997) and 
matures on a rolling 30-day basis. The real properties purchased consist of the 
Company's principal plants and certain adjacent properties. See ""Relationship 
With OYO Japan and Related Transactions.""

provide the Company with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund its 
operations for fiscal 1998 and support an acquisition and expansion program and 
otherwise carry out the Company's business strategy as described elsewhere in

able to obtain a credit facility on terms that it considers reasonable or that, 
even if such a facility is effected, such sources of capital will be sufficient 
to support an acquisition and expansion program in fiscal 1998 or in the long-
term, and the Company may be required to issue additional debt or equity 
securities in the future to meet its capital requirements. See ""Management's

(1) Includes costs and expenses for pilot clinical studies, stability testing 
and costs associated with the FDA approval process. Pilot clinical studies seek 
to demonstrate, in vivo, that a proposed drug product provides a significantly 
accelerated onset of therapeutic action or a given therapeutic effect at a 
significantly reduced dosage, and have an average cost in the range of $100,000 
to $200,000 per study. These studies are conducted after the product development
work referenced in item (2) has been completed indicating that the product would
 be suitable for the Company's delivery systems. 
(2) Includes costs and expenses in connection with product formulation and 
development which occurs earlier in the product development life cycle than the 
pilot studies and testing referenced in item (1). 

(3) Represents expenses for hiring marketing personnel and developing marketing 
and sales and promotional programs, travel and related expenses for attendance 
at seminars, trade shows and related functions, and creation of brochures and 
similar promotional materials and trade show displays. 

(4) Represents costs expected to be incurred for the operation of the Company if
consulting revenues cannot fully support general operating expenses. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of the 
net proceeds of this offering, based on the current status of its proposed 
products, anticipated operating expenses, and current product development and 
marketing plans. The allocation of proceeds and the timing of expenditures 
relating to development of the Company's proposed products are subject to 
numerous factors, including, among others, the stage of development of a 
particular product, the timing of regulatory approvals, the extent of, and 
costs associated with, clinical and other studies, the current status of the 
Company's business and contemplated arrangements with third-parties with 
respect to development and commercialization of its proposed products, as well 
as unanticipated events causing delays. Accordingly, the Company cannot 
accurately predict the amount or potential allocation of the proceeds of the 
offering to any particular proposed product. 


The Company anticipates, based on its current proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations (including the timetable of, and costs associated 
with, new product development), that the proceeds of this offering together 
with projected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its 
contemplated cash requirements for approximately twenty-four (24) months 
following the consummation of this offering. If the Company's plans change, its 
assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or if the proceeds of this 
offering and/or projected cash flow prove to be insufficient to fund operations 
(including due to unanticipated expenses, technical problems or difficulties or 
otherwise), the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some 
of the proceeds within the above-described categories or to use portions 
thereof for other purposes. 
The Company may use a portion of the proceeds of this offering allocated to 
working capital, together with the issuance of debt or equity securities, to 
expand the Company's product line by acquiring rights to, or developing, 
technology and/or products, or by acquiring companies which the Company 
believes are compatible with the Company's business. The Company has no 
agreements, commitments or other arrangements with respect to any such 
acquisition, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to 
successfully expand its operations. 

Any additional net proceeds received upon the exercise of the Underwriters' 
Options, the Class A Warrants or any options or warrants will be used for 
working capital. Pending the use of the proceeds of this offering, the funds 
will be deposited in interest or non-interest bearing accounts, or invested in 
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, government securities or similar 
instruments, short-term certificates of deposit, money market funds or other 
short-term interest-bearing investments."

Approximately $4,222,000 of the net proceeds of this Offering will be used to 
fund the Company's integrated full-scale sales and marketing activities and to 
expand its sales and marketing activities both domestically and internationally,
by hiring additional domestic and internationals sales and marketing personnel, 
increasing advertising, participating in trade shows and other promotional 
activities, developing indirect sales channels and enhancing the Company's 
customer service capabilities. See ""Business--Sales and Marketing."" 

Approximately $4,420,000 of the net proceeds of this Offering will be used to 
repay the Bridge Notes issued in connection with the Bridge Financing 
consummated in July 1997. The Bridge Notes consist of 43 unsecured promissory 
notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4,300,000, bearing interest at the 
rate of 10% per annum through September 30, 1997 and at a rate of 13% per annum 
thereafter and payable with interest thereon upon the consummation of this 
Offering. If the Offering were consummated on October 31, 1997, the interest to 
be paid on the Bridge Notes would be approximately $120,000. Approximately 
$259,000 of the principal and interest to be repaid on the Bridge Notes is to 
be repaid on Bridge Notes held by 5% stockholders and entities affiliated with 
directors of the Company. The net proceeds from the sale of the Bridge Notes 
have been used primarily for working capital purposes, including payments to 
suppliers and the repayment of an aggregate $500,000 of principal amount 
unsecured promissory notes (""First Interim Financing Notes"") issued in 
connection with an interim financing consummated in May 1997 (""First Interim 
Financing""). In addition, approximately $208,000 of the net proceeds of this 
Offering will be used to repay the Second Interim Financing Note and 
approximately $600,000 of the net proceeds of this Offering will be used to 
repay the October 1997 Interim Financing Notes. The net proceeds from the 
Second Interim Financing and the October 1997 Interim Financing have been used 
primarily for working capital purposes. The October 1997 Interim Financing 
Notes are held by 5% stockholders of the Company. See ""Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations --Liquidity and 
Capital Resources and ""Certain Transactions."" 

Approximately $2,000,000 of the net proceeds of this Offering will be used for 
research and development, including enhancements to existing features and 
development of new functions for Voyager and QueryObject System and the 
salaries and related payroll costs of additional research and development 
personnel. See ""Research and Development."" 

The balance of the net proceeds of this Offering will be allocated to working 
capital and general corporate purposes, including payment of salaries 
(including salaries of its executive officers). A portion of the proceeds 
allocated to working capital will be used to pay taxing authorities amounts due 
for sales, use, excise and past due payroll taxes, as well as to make payments 
to certain vendors which are currently past due. If the Underwriters exercise 
the over-allotment option in full, the Company will realize additional net 
proceeds of $2,002,500, which will be added to working capital. Management will 
have significant discretion regarding how and when such proceeds will be 
applied. 

The allocation of the net proceeds of the Offering set forth above represents 
the Company's best estimates based upon its current plans and certain 
assumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions and the 
Company's future revenues and expenditures. If any of these factors change, the 
Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds 
within the above-described categories. 


Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested temporarily, pending their application as described above, in short-
term United States government securities, short-term bank certificates of 
deposit, money market funds or other investment grade, short-term, interest-
bearing instruments. 
The Company anticipates, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations (including the costs associated with its growth 
strategy), that the proceeds of the Offering, together with its existing 
financial resources and revenues, should be sufficient to satisfy its 
anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 14 months; however, there 
can be no assurance that this will be the case. The Company's actual cash 
requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend upon 
numerous factors, including the general market acceptance of the Company's new 
and existing products and services, the growth of the Company's distribution 
channels, the technological advances and activities of competitors, and other 
factors. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations."""

to repay a substantial amount of its financial institution debt, it will, 
immediately following the Offering, acquire a revolving line of credit facility 
with a borrowing base of at least $15 million (the Company has a commitment 
letter from NBD Bank for a $15 million revolving line of credit facility, 
subject to the consummation of the Offering, and will either enter into an 
agreement with NBD Bank based on such commitment or with another financial 
institution on the same or better terms) and intends to utilize the resulting 
increased borrowing availability under such new line of credit as necessary in 
the ordinary course of its business, including for increased inventories and 
receivables and continued growth of the Company and its subsidiaries. In 
addition, the Company may use a portion of such increased borrowing 
availability to acquire businesses which the Company believes are compatible 
with its business strategy; however, while the Company regularly evaluates 
possible acquisition opportunities, as of the date of this Prospectus, the 
Company has no agreements, commitments, understandings or arrangements with 
respect to any acquisition other than the Closing Acquisitions. See

prime lending rate (a total of 9.75% as of September 30, 1997) and matures on 
December 31, 1997 (the 'Utilase/Comerica Equipment Line'). See 'Management's

Stock offered hereby, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated 
expenses payable by the Company, are estimated to be approximately $14,130,000 
($16,362,000 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). 
The Company expects to use the net proceeds to fund research and development, 
in-licensing of technology and clinical trials of product candidates and for 
working capital and general corporate purposes. 

The Company believes that the net proceeds of this offering, together with the 
Company's present capital resources, should be sufficient to fund operations at 
least through the end of 1999, based on the Company's current operating plan. 
No assurance can be given that there will be no change that would consume the 
Company's liquid assets before such time. The Company will require substantial 
funds in addition to the proceeds of this offering to conduct development 
activities, preclinical studies, clinical trials and other activities relating 
to the commercialization of any potential products. The Company cannot 
currently estimate with any accuracy the amount of these additional funds 
because it may vary significantly depending on results of research and 
development and product testing, potential relationships with in-licensors and 
collaborators, changes in the focus and direction of the Company's research and
 development programs, competitive and technological advances, the cost of 
filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims, the regulatory 
approval process, manufacturing, marketing and other costs associated with 
commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and 
other factors. The Company anticipates that it will seek these funds from 
external sources, such as future offerings of equity or debt securities or 
agreements with corporate partners and collaborators with respect to the 
development of the Company's technology. There can be no assurance, however, 
that the Company will be able to negotiate such arrangements or obtain the 
additional funds it will require on acceptable terms, if at all. 

In addition, the amount of the proceeds from this offering that the Company 
will devote to each of the purposes described herein may vary significantly 
because of results of research and development and product testing, potential 
relationships with in-licensors and collaborators, changes in the focus and 
direction of the Company's research and development programs, competitive and 
technological advances, the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and 
enforcing patent claims, the regulatory approval process, the need to procure 
clinical grade compounds, through third-parties or otherwise, marketing and 
other costs associated with commercialization of products following receipt of 
regulatory approvals and other factors. The Company's lease for all of its 
facilities expires in April 1998. If the Company elects to move to a new 
location, it may incur substantial expenses for leasehold improvements and 
relocation costs, which the Company estimates will cost up to $2.0 million. If 
the Company remains in its current facilities, it expects to incur costs of 
approximately $500,000 to enhance its manufacturing capabilities. 

Pending such uses, the net proceeds from this offering will be invested by the 
Company in short-term, interest bearing investment grade securities."

Common Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately
$41.7 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders.
  The principal purposes of this offering are to increase the Company's equity
capital, to establish a public market for the Company's Common Stock, to
provide enhanced equity incentives to attract and retain key employees, to
increase the Company's visibility in its markets, to facilitate future access
to public capital markets and to obtain additional working capital. The
Company will use a portion of the net proceeds to repay a promissory note
issued by the Company in connection with the acquisition of R.D. Nickel. This
note bears simple interest at a rate of 9% per annum and will have an
outstanding balance of principal and accrued interest at November 15, 1997 of
approximately Cdn$7.1 million (US$5.1 million). It has a stated maturity date
of September 30, 1999, but requires prepayment upon consummation of this
offering. In accordance with the terms of the acquisition of R.D. Nickel, upon
consummation of this offering, the Company will owe an additional payment of
Cdn$500,000 (approximately US$360,000), which will be paid from the net
proceeds of this offering. See ""Company Background.""
  The remainder of the net proceeds of this offering will be used for working
capital and other general corporate purposes, including financing product
development and augmenting the Company's professional services business. A
portion of the net proceeds may also be used to fund acquisitions of
complementary businesses, products or technologies. The Company is not
currently a party to any agreements, understandings or negotiations with
respect to any material acquisitions. Pending such uses, the Company intends
to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, investment grade
securities."

(1) The Company expects to use $3,000,000 of the net proceeds to cover the pre-opening
 costs and expenses (including construction and equipment) of four Max's Grille 
Restaurants. On July 1, 1997 the Company entered into an agreement with URCI 
pursuant to which the Company committed $3,000,000 in net proceeds of this offering 
in exchange for 51 percent equity interests in the entities that own or will own 
the four Max's Grille Restaurants. These entities are Florida limited partnerships,
 the limited partner of which is Unique Restaurant Concepts, Ltd., the general 
partner of which is URCI, the owners of which are Company directors Catalfumo,
 Max and Rapoport, and the general partner of which is a Florida corporation owned 
by Company directors Catalfumo, Max and Rapoport. See ""Business -- The Max's Grille 
Restaurants"". Such proceeds will ultimately be paid to Catalfumo Construction 
and Development, Inc., the construction firm controlled by Company director Daniel 
Catalfumo. URCI, which is owned by Company directors Catalfumo, Max and Rapoport,
 will be beneficiaries of the proceeds, insofar as payment to the construction 
company will ensure that the Max's Grille Restaurants shall be built. 
(2) The Company expects to use $400,000 of the net proceeds to redeem 80,000 
shares of its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. See ""Description of Securities"".
(3) The Company expects to use $125,000 of the net proceeds to repay its debt to 
director Catalumo. Mr. Catalfumo is a principal of URCI, owns the above-referenced 
construction company that has built several restaurants for URCI and which built 
Max's Beach Place Grille (one of the Max's Grille Restaurants) and is building
 the other Max's Grille Restaurants. See ""Description of Securities"". 
(4) The balance of the net proceeds will be utilized by the Company to cover its 
working capital needs. 
Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be invested 
principally in short-term bank certificates of deposit, United States Government 
obligations, money market instruments or short-term investment grade securities."

Klamath Falls Timberlands in August 1996, $3.6 million in Guarantee Fees and 
approximately $10.2 million in accrued interest; and (ii) $270.0 million of 
bank indebtedness incurred by USTK in July 1997 to refinance indebtedness 
incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Klamath Falls Timberlands

approximately $1.7 million in accrued interest. The Holdings Debt matures in 
September 1999 and bears interest at a floating rate, adjusted monthly (6.19% 
per annum at September 30, 1997). The USTK Debt consists of $70.0 million 
outstanding under a revolving credit facility and $200.0 million outstanding 
under a term credit facility, each of which matures in June 2004 and bears 
interest at a variable rate (7.94% per annum at September 30, 1997). The

(i) $31.0 million to redeem the Senior Notes in full; 
(ii) $64.0 million to repay in full the principal amount outstanding under the

The Credit Facilities consist of (i) a senior secured credit facility (the 
""Senior Facility"") and (ii) the Company's outstanding $31.0 million aggregate 
principal amount Senior Subordinated Increasing Rate Notes (the ""Senior Notes"").
 In March 1997, pursuant to the Senior Facility, certain financial institutions,
 as lenders, Credit Lyonnais New York Branch, as a lender and as administrative
 agent, and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc.,
 as a lender and as advisor, arranger and syndication agent (collectively, the 
""Lenders""), provided to the Company a $65.0 million five-year term loan (the 
""Term Loan"") and a $25.0 million three-year revolving credit facility with a

 Credit Facility""). As of September 30, 1997, the outstanding indebtedness 
under the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility was $64.0 million and 
$15.0 million, respectively. Absent a default or an event of default (as defined
 in the Senior Facility), outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan accrue 
interest at a rate per annum equal to one, two, three or six month LIBOR plus 3
 1/4% and outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue 
interest at a rate per annum equal to one, two, three or six month LIBOR plus 2
 3/4%. As of September 30, 1997, the interest rate applicable to outstanding
 borrowings under the Term Loan was 8.94% and the weighted average interest rate
 applicable to outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was
 8.68%. For a description of the Senior Facility, see ""Management's Discussion
 and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and 
Capital Resources."" 
In March 1997, the Company issued the Senior Notes pursuant to a Senior 
Subordinated Increasing Rate Note Purchase Agreement (the ""Senior Notes 
Agreement"") to certain investors, as interim lenders, including Strategic 
Resource Partners, an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc. As of September 30, 
1997, the principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes was $31.0 million.
 As of September 30, 1997, the interest rate applicable to the outstanding 
principal amounts of the Senior Notes was 12.28%."

approximately $4.9 million will be paid to Cree under the Development Agreement

the net proceeds of this offering to fund the acquisition of additional SiC 
crystal growth systems from Cree, which the Company could be required to 
purchase for use by Cree in supplying commercial production quantities of SiC 
crystals to the Company. Under the Exclusive Supply Agreement, Cree has the 
option to require the Company to purchase such systems from Cree at Cree's cost 
or to build such systems itself and recoup its costs by incorporating the cost 
of the systems into the cost of the SiC crystals purchased by the Company. See 
""Business -- Dependence on Cree and Cree Technology."" The Company has not 
received any indication from Cree as to whether future capacity requirements 
will be met at the Company's or Cree's expense. The Company also intends to use 
approximately $2.8 million to purchase other equipment from unaffiliated third 
parties. In addition, the Company plans to use approximately $6.8 million of 
the net proceeds to fund its sales and marketing efforts. 

The remaining net proceeds will be used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes or may be used to fund additional equipment purchases or 
sales and marketing expenses as the Company's business develops. Pending 
application of the net proceeds as set forth above, the Company intends to 
invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment grade debt securities. The 
Company reserves the right to reallocate the use of the net proceeds of the 
offering to meet the business needs of the Company, which could be required if 
Cree is unable to develop a fully repeatable process for growing SiC crystals 
in desired colors, sizes and volumes, if market acceptance of lab-created 
moissanite gemstones is slower than anticipated or if there are unanticipated 
technological or other changes within the jewelry industry. The Company 
currently believes that its existing capital resources, together with the net 
proceeds of this offering and interest earned thereon, will satisfy the 
Company's capital requirements at least through the 12 months following this

facilities (see ""Business -- Properties"") and (iii) approximately $81.9 
million, for general corporate purposes, including working capital, product 
development, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions. While the Company 
engages from time to time in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions,
 the Company has no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to 
any such acquisitions as of the date of this Prospectus. The debt to be repaid 
consists of (i) borrowings under the Company's revolving line of credit which 
were incurred to fund operations, bear interest at a weighted average rate of 
8.25% and mature in December 1997 ($10.7 million outstanding as of September 
30, 1997), (ii) a $5.3 million note payable to a financial institution, due 
July 2002, that bears interest at 0.375% over the prime rate of the institution 
and was used to finance the repurchase of common stock from a stockholder, 
(iii) a $3.7 million note payable to a financial institution, due March 2001, 
that bears interest at 0.375% over the prime rate of the institution and was 
used to repay an industrial development bond, (iv) a $1.0 million note payable 
to a financial institution, due January 2001, that bears interest at 8.92% and 
was used to finance the purchase of property, and (v) a $3.6 million non-
interest bearing note due June 1999 and payable to an existing stockholder 
which was issued by the Company as partial consideration for the repurchase of 
certain of such stockholder's shares. The Company will not receive any proceeds 
from the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends 
to invest the net proceeds from the Offering in short-term, investment grade, 
interest bearing securities. Investment of the net proceeds in short-term 
investments rather than operations could adversely affect the Company's overall 
return on its capital. The foregoing represents the Company's present 
intentions with respect to the allocation of proceeds of the Offering based 
upon its present plans and business conditions. The occurrence of certain 
unforeseen events or changed business conditions, however, could result in the 
application of the proceeds of the Offering in a manner other than as described 
in this Prospectus. See ""Risk Factors -- Lack of Current Specific Plans for 
Unallocated Offering Proceeds."""

RETIREMENT OF BANK DEBT. Approximately $2,500,000 of the proceeds from this 
offering will be used to retire the balance of the Company's outstanding 
obligation to National City Bank (the ""Bank""), which obligation arose in 
January 1997 and matures in January 1998. The Company used $2,200,000 of the 
proceeds from such loan to finance the acquisition of assets from Telco West, 
Inc. (""Telco West""). See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Acquisitions."" The Company makes 
principal payments to the Bank on a monthly basis, together with interest on 
the outstanding loan balance accruing at the rate of two points over the 
""reference"" rate announced from time to time by the Bank. 

ACQUISITIONS AND EXPANSION. The Company will reserve approximately $2,000,000 
of the proceeds from this offering for acquisitions and expansion. The Company 
anticipates expanding its business through the acquisition of site contracts 
and related assets from PSPs. The Company completed the Telco West acquisition 
in January 1997 and the acquisition of assets of Computer Assisted Technologies,
Inc. (""CAT"") in August 1997. Although the Company routinely explores 
acquisition opportunities, no acquisitions are pending as of the date hereof. 
The portion of the proceeds allocated for future acquisitions will only be used 
for acquisitions of payphone routes and related businesses and assets. If the 
Company does not use the full amount of proceeds allocated for acquisitions and 
expansion, it may use such proceeds for further debt reduction and general 
corporate purposes. 

WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. The remainder of the proceeds, 
estimated to be $116,000, will be retained as working capital and used for 
general corporate purposes. 

If the Underwriter exercises the over-allotment option in full, the Company 
will realize additional net proceeds of approximately $747,600, which may be 
used for further debt reduction, to finance acquisitions or for general 
corporate purposes. In addition, the Company may derive up to $8,740,000 from 
the exercise of the Redeemable Warrants included in the Units. Any amounts that 
the Company derives from the exercise of the Redeemable Warrants are expected 
to be used for further debt reduction, to finance acquisitions or for general 
corporate purposes. The Company has the right, under certain circumstances, to 
redeem the Redeemable Warrants for a total cost of up to $9,200. See ""Risk 
Factors - Current Prospectus and State Registration Required to Exercise 
Warrants; Possible Redemption of Warrants."" 

The foregoing use of proceeds is based upon the Company's expectations with 
respect to its projected business operations and anticipated revenue from such 
operations. If such expectations are not met, the Company may have to 
reallocate the proceeds in such manner as it deems appropriate under the 
circumstances. 

Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in bank 
certificates of deposit, investment-grade securities and short-term, income-
producing investments, including government obligations and other money market 
instruments. The Company believes that the net proceeds of this offering, 
together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to conduct 
its operations for two years."

     The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of
the net proceeds of the Offering during the next approximately 12 months. This
estimate is based on certain assumptions, including that the consolidation of
the acquired companies is successfully completed, revenues from operations do
not fall below anticipated levels, no events occur which would cause the Company
to abandon any particular efforts and that competitive conditions remain stable.
The amounts actually expended for each purpose may vary significantly in the
event any of these assumptions prove inaccurate. The Company reserves the right
to change its use of proceeds as unanticipated events may cause the Company to
redirect its priorities and reallocate the proceeds accordingly.
     Any additional proceeds received upon exercise of the Underwriters'
over-allotment option will be added to working capital. Pending utilization, the
net proceeds of the Offering will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing
investments."

offered by the Company hereby, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts 
and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately US$14.1 million (or 
approximately US$16.8 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full). The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
the 200,000 ADSs by the Selling Shareholders. 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds to the Company from the Offering as 
follows: (i) approximately A$11.2 million (approximately US$8.0 million) to be 
used for repayment of indebtedness incurred under the credit facility (the ""ANZ 
Facility"") by and between the Company and the Australian and New Zealand 
Banking Group Limited (""ANZ"") in connection with the Capital Reduction, (ii) 
approximately US$1.8 million to be used for repayment of all outstanding 
indebtedness under a term loan and revolving line of credit facility (the 
""Merrill Lynch Facility"") by and between Barbeques Galore, Inc., the Company's 
U.S. operating subsidiary (along with its U.S. parent, The Galore Group (USA), 
Inc., ""Galore USA""), and Merrill Lynch Business Financial Services, Inc. 
(""Merrill Lynch""), and (iii) approximately A$6.0 million (approximately US$4.3 
million) to be used for expansion of the Company's operations in the United 
States. The Company's borrowing under the ANZ Facility relating to its real 
property loan (in the aggregate, A$2.2 million at an interest rate of 9.35% per 
annum) provides for a variable prepayment penalty depending on the term of the 
loan. As of October 1997, the penalty would be approximately A$100,000. In 
light of recent declines in interest rates, the Company will periodically 
assess whether prepayment is economically advantageous. The majority of the 
remainder of the Company's borrowings under the ANZ Facility are commercial 
paper borrowings bearing interest, as of October 1997, at approximately 5.1% 
per annum plus an additional percentage fee payable to ANZ of approximately 
1.25%. There are no significant prepayment penalties associated with these loans
. The Company anticipates that approximately A$20.5 million will be outstanding 
under the ANZ Facility subsequent to the application of the net proceeds of the 
Offering. The revolving line and the term loan under the Merrill Lynch Facility 
accrue interest at the 30-day commercial paper rate plus 
2.65% and 2.70%, respectively. There are no prepayment penalties associated 
with the Merrill Lynch Facility. Pending the uses described above, the Company 
intends to apply the net proceeds of the Offering to repay short-term debt or 
invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade 
securities. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

million after deducting estimated offering expenses payable by the Company and 
underwriting discounts and commissions. The Company will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. 
The principal purposes of this offering are to increase the Company's equity 
capital and to create a public market for the Company's Common Stock, which 
will facilitate future access by the Company to the public financial markets 
and help to attract and retain key employees. The Company intends to use 
approximately $3.9 million of the net proceeds to repay indebtedness. The 
Company intends to use the balance of the net proceeds for working capital and 
general corporate purposes, including the financing of potential acquisitions 
and new centers currently under development that the Company would otherwise 
finance with mortgage debt. Although the Company regularly evaluates 
acquisition opportunities, it is not a party to any letter of intent or other 
agreement regarding any acquisition. Pending such uses, the Company intends to 
invest the net proceeds of this offering primarily in investment grade, 
interest-bearing securities. 

The Company intends to repay unsecured indebtedness outstanding as of September 
30, 1997, of approximately $2.4 million, plus accrued interest, to 
ServiceMaster incurred in connection with the acquisition of GreenTree in 
December 1995, which indebtedness is required to be repaid in the event of an 
initial public offering. This indebtedness began accruing interest June 1, 1996 
at a variable rate per annum equal to the prime rate declared by First National 
Bank of Chicago. The principal balance of this indebtedness was $2.6 million as 
of June 30, 1997. At September 30, 1997, the interest rate on this indebtedness 
was 8.5%. The Company also intends to repay approximately $1.5 million in 
mortgage debt outstanding as of September 30, 1997 under three mortgage notes
 consisting of: $650,000 owed to BankBoston--Connecticut, N.A., which debt has 
a maturity date of November 1999 and bears interest at a variable rate per 
annum equal to the base rate plus 1.0%; $370,000 owed to SouthTrust Bank of 
West Florida, which debt has a maturity of October 2000 and bears interest at a 
fixed rate of 9.0% per annum; and $500,000 owed to Fleet National Bank, which 
debt has a maturity date of June 2016 and bears interest at a variable rate per 
annum, equal to the base rate plus .25%. At September 30, 1997, the interest 
rate on the mortgage note to BankBoston--Connecticut, N.A. was 9.5% and the 
interest on the mortgage note to Fleet National Bank was 8.75%."

minority interests in a subsidiary of the Company. See ""Certain Transactions.""
Prior to the consummation of the Offering, borrowings under the Senior Credit
Facility bear interest at the prime rate established from time to time by

In connection with the Combination, the Company plans to use approximately 
$14.2 million of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay certain indebtedness 
of the Constituent Companies assumed pursuant to the Combination. At June 30, 
1997, such indebtedness had interest rates ranging between 7.5% and 12.5% and 
had a weighted average interest rate of 9.3%. Such indebtedness, if not prepaid,
 would otherwise mature at various dates through February 2026. See ""Risk 
Factors -- Use of Proceeds; Availability of Capital"", ""The Combination"" and

The Company intends to spend approximately $2.5 million to upgrade and equip 
each center in the Precision Tune Auto Care system with current signage and a 
""point of sale"" computer system, which will communicate sales results and other 
data to the Company's corporate office. Following the Combination, the Company 
will make an investment to ensure that each existing center is equipped with 
the Company's proprietary point of sale system. For those centers which do not 
currently have the system, the Company will provide the system (which costs 
approximately $2,500) directly to the franchisee. For those centers which 
already have the system, the Company will reimburse the franchisee for up to 
$2,500 of costs the franchisee incurred in installing the system. In addition, 
the Company will invest up to $2,500 to upgrade each center's signage to 
current image standards. $1.5 million of the net proceeds from the Offering 
will be used for this purpose and the balance will be financed through 
borrowings under a revolving credit facility. 

The Company recently entered into a letter of understanding to purchase all of 
the outstanding capital shares of Worldwide Drying Systems, Inc. (""Worldwide"") 
for $2.8 million. Worldwide manufactures and distributes drying systems for 
installation in automatic car washes. The terms of the agreement call for a 
cash payment at closing of $1.6 million and seller financing of $1.2 million. 
The promissory note will bear interest at a rate of 9% per annum and require 
monthly payments of principal and interest over a four-year term. The Company 
expects to close the transaction immediately following the consummation of the 
Offering and the Combination. The Company intends to use $1.5 million of the 
net proceeds of the Offering to substantially fund the cash portion of the 
purchase price. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends 
to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment grade or government, 
interest-bearing securities. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the 
sale of shares of Common Stock offered by the Selling Shareholders. See

Research and Development Expenses. The Company intends to continue investing in 
the further development of its oral drug delivery technologies and the DepoMed 
Systems. The Company also intends to continue to develop a reduced irritation 
aspirin product and an enhanced absorption calcium supplement product 
internally. The Company intends to conduct or fund clinical trials, as 
required, on such products and will undertake the associated regulatory 
activities. 

Laboratory and Facilities Capital Expenditures. The Company intends to spend a 
portion of the net proceeds of this Offering to make capital investments in 
laboratories and related facilities, including the leasing of laboratory, 
testing and pilot manufacturing facilities, leasehold improvements and purchase 
of laboratory and pilot scale manufacturing equipment. 

Repayment of Certain Indebtedness. Approximately $1,000,000 of the net proceeds 
of this Offering will be used to repay indebtedness of the Company incurred in 
connection with the Bridge Financing. In connection with the Bridge Financing, 
the Company issued promissory notes (the ""Bridge Notes"") in the aggregate 
principal amount of $1,000,000 to fund working capital and general corporate 
purposes. Interest accrues on the Bridge Notes at the rate of 6% per annum and 
the Bridge Notes will become due and payable on the consummation of the 
Offering. Approximately $600,000 of the net proceeds of this Offering will be 
used to repay other indebtedness of the Company, including unpaid salaries and 
five promissory notes held by officers of the Company. As of June 30, 1997, 
$1,250,667 of principal was outstanding and $65,364 of interest was outstanding 
on such promissory notes. Interest accrues on $150,667 of principal at the rate 
of 6% per annum and on the remaining $100,000 at the rate of 6.5% per annum. 
See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Offering, based on the current state of its operations, its 
current plans and current economic conditions. Proceeds may be reapportioned 
among categories listed above. The amount and timing of expenditures will vary 
depending upon a number of factors, including progress of the Company's 
operations, technical advances, terms of collaborative arrangements, changes in 
competitive conditions and determinations with respect to the commercial 
potential of products utilizing the DepoMed Systems. 

The Company currently anticipates that the net proceeds of this Offering will 
enable it to meet its operational and capital requirements for at least the 12 
months following the date of this Prospectus. However, there can be no 
assurance the net proceeds of this Offering will satisfy the Company's 
requirements for any particular period of time. Further, the net proceeds of 
this Offering are not expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's 
operations through commercialization of products yielding sufficient revenues 
to support the Company's operations. To the extent capital resources are 
insufficient to meet future capital requirements, the Company will have to 
raise additional funds to continue the development of the DepoMed Systems. 
There can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms, 
or at all. See ""Risk Factors--Need for Substantial Additional Funds."" 

Pending application of the net proceeds of the Offering, the Company intends to 
invest such net proceeds in interest-bearing, short-term investment grade

Common Stock offered by the Company (at the initial public offering
price of $12.00 per share), after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses, are estimated to be $21.2 million.
Such net proceeds will be used primarily (i) to acquire the non-dental assets
of additional dental practices, (ii) to provide working capital and (iii) for
general corporate purposes. The Company may use a portion of the net proceeds
of this Offering to purchase businesses complementary to the business of the
Company and to lend money to PAs to be formed in the future by existing or
future PA owners for the purpose of acquiring the dental assets of certain
additional dental practices. The Company cannot presently determine the
allocation of proceeds among the above listed uses of proceeds. The Company
will determine such allocation based upon its future business needs. The
Company is currently considering the acquisition of the capital stock of
Profit. It is anticipated that such acquisition will not happen prior to 1998
and will be consummated only upon approval of the outside members of the Board
of Directors. The owners of certain PAs with which the Company has Management
Agreements have executed non-binding letters of intent to acquire ten dental
practices, which practices reported aggregate revenue for their last full
fiscal year of approximately $10.0 million. It is estimated that the aggregate
purchase price for the dental and the non-dental assets of these practices will
be approximately $6.0 million. The structure and timing of such potential
transactions have not been finally determined. Such potential transactions are
subject, among other things, to the negotiation of definitive agreements. If
such transactions are consummated, the acquiring PAs are expected to enter into
Management Agreements with the Company. No assurance can be given that any such
acquisitions will be consummated by the PA owner, that the Company will enter
into Management Agreements with respect to such practices or that any such
practices will be successfully integrated into the Company's network. See ""Risk
Factors--Broad Discretion of Management in Applying Proceeds of Offering"" and
""-Risks Associated with Expansion Strategy."" Pending such applications, the net
proceeds will be invested in investment grade, short-term, interest-bearing
securities. The Company will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of
any Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the over-allotment
option, if exercised. If any Selling Stockholder fails to sell to the
Underwriters any such additional shares, the Company has agreed that it will
issue and sell to the Underwriters an equal number of shares of Common Stock.
In such event the total proceeds to the Company will increase by $11.16
(assuming an initial public offering price of $12.00 per share) multiplied by
the number of such additional shares issued by the Company. See ""Principal and

(1) The Offering proceeds will be used to repay the principal amount of the 
1996 Notes, issued June 30, 1996 and July 16, 1996, and the Bridge Notes, 
issued August 8, 1997, in the amount of $3,000,000 and $2,000,000, respectively,
 together with estimated accrued interest thereon through the closing date of 
the Offering amounting to $400,000 and $50,000, respectively. As a result of 
the attribution of value of the Bridge Warrants issued with the Bridge Notes, 
the Bridge Notes have an effective interest rate which exceeds 300%. See ""Risk 
Factors--Anticipated Non-Cash Charges."" As a result of the Bridge Financing, 
the Company received approximately $1,700,000 of net proceeds, which funds are 
being used to finance the Company's short-term working capital needs and to 
fund expenses of the Company in connection with the Offering. As a result of 
the 1996 Placement, the Company received approximately $5,404,300 of net 
proceeds, which funds were used by the Company to pay overdue trade accounts 
payable, fund the Company's long-term projects, and fund the Company's working 
capital needs. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources.' 

(2) The Company's plans to increase its engineering staff by adding 
approximately 36 new positions. 

(3) Includes $1,633,750 allocated to the Company's plans to increase its sales

Interactive Video Segment--Sales and Marketing"" and ""--CD-ROM Segment--Sales 
and Marketing"" for additional uses of these proceeds. 

(4) The Company plans to increase its administrative staff by adding 
approximately five new positions. 

(5) The Company agreed to extinguish approximately $25,000 of lease 
obligations guaranteed by Mr. Youssefi and to pay Mr. Youssefi the remaining 
balance (approximately $15,000) under a termination agreement relating to the 
termination of Mr. Youssefi's employment with the Company. See 'Certain 
Relationships and Related Transactions.' 

Any net proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of the Underwriter's 
over-allotment option or the Underwriter's Warrants will be added to working

amounts outstanding under the revolving loan facility between Fleet Capital 
Corporation (""Fleet"") and the Company (the ""Revolving Loan""), which amount was 
$7.9 million at September 30, 1997 and which facility will remain available for 
future use by the Company, (ii) redeem in full, through a cash payment of $18.2

50% of the amount outstanding under the $30.5 million term loan facility between
the Company, CIT and Fleet (the ""Term Loan""), which amount was $28.5 million at 
September 30, 1997 and which may not be repaid until January 1998, (iv) make a 
cash payment to CIT of $1.05 million in connection with the CIT Exercise,
(v) modify, upgrade and refurbish drilling rigs and equipment currently owned by
the Company at an estimated cost of between $16 million and $18 million and

Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Loan bear interest based on Fleet's 
prime rate and mature in April 2000. Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan 
bear interest, at the election of the Company, at floating rates based upon 
Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"")
and mature in March 2002. At September 30, 1997, the applicable interest rates 
under the Revolving Loan and the Term Loan were 10% and 9.95%, respectively. 
The Subordinated Notes to be redeemed from Chesapeake were issued by the Company
in May 1997 in an original principal amount of $18 million, mature on May 1, 
2003 and bear interest at the option of the Company at either (i) 11% per annum,
payable in cash, or (ii) 12.875% per annum, payable in the form of additional 
Subordinated Notes. See ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions --

the expansion of its leasing business. Approximately $18 million of the net

Company's bank lines of credit. The Company's existing lines of credit bear 
interest at variable rates varying from 30-day LIBOR plus 1.75%, LIBOR plus

  be determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently estimated
  that such net proceeds will be between $18,258,820 and $24,825,580, based on
  the current Valuation Range.  If the gross proceeds of the shares sold are
  increased to 15% above the maximum of the Valuation Range, it is estimated
  that net proceeds will equal $28,601,467.  See ""PRO FORMA DATA"" for the
  assumptions used to arrive at these amounts.  The actual net proceeds may vary
  materially from the estimated amounts described herein.  The estimated amount
  of net proceeds includes proceeds from the sale of the shares which are

  to enable such purchases is estimated to range from $1,734,000 (if 433,500
  shares are issued) to $2,697,900 (if 674,475 shares are issued).  If for any
  reason the ESOP is unable to purchase its shares in the Subscription Offering,
  the ESOP is expected to purchase its shares in the open market--in which event
  the cost of the purchases may be higher or lower because the purchase price
  per share may be higher or lower than $50.00.  See ""MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK --

       After first deducting the amount of the net proceeds used by the Company
  to make the loan to the ESOP (estimated to range from $1,734,000 to

  the remaining net proceeds of the Offerings and will pay the balance of the
  net proceeds to the Bank in exchange for all of the common stock of the Bank 
  to be issued in connection with the Conversion. The Company expects to use the
  portion of the net proceeds it retains for working capital and investment 
  purposes. The Company does not expect to have significant operating expenses 
  and anticipates that it will initially invest the net proceeds it retains 
  primarily in interest-earning deposits, U.S. government, federal agency and 
  other marketable securities and mortgage-backed securities. The types and 
  amounts of such investments will vary from time to time based upon the 
  interest rate environment, asset/liability mix considerations and other 
  factors.

       Net proceeds paid to the Bank initially will become part of the Bank's
  general funds and will be invested primarily in mortgage, consumer and other
  loans, and investments consisting primarily of interest-earning deposit
  balances, U.S. government and federal agency obligations and other marketable
  securities in accordance with the Bank's lending and investment policies.  The
  relative amounts to be invested in each of these types of investments will
  depend upon loan demand, rates of return and asset/liability matching
  considerations at the time the investments are to be made.  Management is not
  able to predict the yields which will be produced by the investment of the
  proceeds of the Offerings because such yields will be significantly influenced
  by general economic conditions and the interest rate environment existing at
  the time the investments are made.  Remaining net proceeds paid to the Bank
  will be used for general corporate purposes.

       The proceeds of the Offerings will result in an increase in the Bank's
  net worth and regulatory capital and may enhance the potential for growth
  through increased lending and investment activities, branch expansion,
  additional ATMs or otherwise.  The net proceeds retained by the Company could
  be used to support the future expansion of operations of the Company through
  the opening of one or more branch offices in or near the Bank's primary market
  area.  The Company has no current plans to open any additional office.
  Payments for shares of Common Stock of the Company made through the withdrawal
  of existing deposit accounts at the Bank will not result in the receipt of new
  funds for investment by the Bank.

       Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors will have the
  authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and regulatory
  requirements.  Based upon facts and circumstances which may arise following
  the Conversion, the Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in
  the future.  Such facts and circumstances may include but are not limited to
  (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the Common Stock is
  trading, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment
  alternatives in terms of the rates of return and risks involved in the
  investments, (ii) the ability to increase the book value and earnings per
  share of the remaining outstanding shares, and improve the Company's return on
  equity; (iii) the reduction of dilution to stockholders caused by having to
  issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund
  employee stock benefit plans; and (iv) any other circumstances in which
  repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company and its
  stockholders.

       Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board
  of Directors that both the Company and the Bank will be capitalized in excess
  of applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that
  capital will be adequate taking into account, among other things, the level of
  nonperforming assets and other risks, the Company's and the Bank's current and
  projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic
  environment and tax and other regulatory considerations.  Federal regulations
  require that, subject to certain exceptions, the Company must obtain approval
  of the Federal Reserve prior to repurchasing Common Stock in excess of 10% of
  its net worth during any twelve-month period.  See ""SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
  -- Regulation of the Company -- Dividend and Repurchase Limitations.""  The
  Company does not intend to repurchase any Common Stock during the first year
  following the Conversion.

       The Company and the Bank have no present intention to file consolidated
  tax returns which will preserve for the Company the ability to use a portion
  of the proceeds to make a return of captial in the future. However, the
  Company has not made any decision to pay such a return of capital. The Company
  and the Bank have agreed to notify the FDIC before making a return of capital
  during the first three years following the Conversion. See ""DIVIDEND
  POLICY.""

       At any time following approval of the MRP by the Company's stockholders,
  it is expected that the MRP may acquire a number of shares of Common Stock
  equal to 4% of the number of shares issued in the Conversion. See ""MANAGEMENT
  OF THE BANK -- Proposed Management Recognition Plan."" Such shares may be
  acquired in the open market or acquired through the Company's issuance of
  authorized but unissued shares. In the event shares are acquired in the open
  market, the funds for such purchase may be provided by the Bank from the
  proceeds of the Conversion. It is estimated that
  between 17,340 and 23,460 shares may be acquired by the MRP Trust, assuming
  the issuance of between 433,500 and 586,500 shares, respectively, in the
  Conversion. If all such shares were acquired by the MRP in the open market,
  and if such shares were acquired at a price of $50.00 per share, the Bank
  would contribute between $867,000 and $1,173,000, respectively, to the MRP for
  this purpose."

until the offering is complete,  we presently  anticipate  that the net proceeds
from  the  sale of  Common  Stock  will be  between  $6,938,000  and  $9,521,000
($11,011,000  million assuming an increase in EVR by 15%). See ""PRO FORMA DATA.""
The Company  will use the  majority  of the net  proceeds  from the  offering to
purchase  all of the  capital  stock  we  will  issue  in  connection  with  the
Conversion. Subject to regulatory approval, the Company will retain up to 25% of
the net  proceeds.  A portion of the net  proceeds to be retained by the Company
will be loaned to our ESOP to fund its  purchase  of up to 8% of the shares sold
in the Conversion.  Based on the issuance of 744,000 shares, or 1,006,000 shares
at the minimum  and  maximum of the EVR,  the loan to the ESOP would be $595,200
and $804,800, respectively. If these shares are not available in the Conversion,
they  will  be  purchased  in  the  open  market  following  completion  of  the
Conversion.  On a short-term  basis, the balance of the net proceeds retained by
the Company initially will be invested in short-term  investments.  A portion of
the net proceeds may also be used to fund the purchase of up to 4% of the shares
for a RSP which is anticipated to be adopted  following the Conversion.  Some of
the proceeds may be used to expand  facilities,  in particular the establishment
of branch offices. See ""PRO FORMA DATA.""

     Although we exceed all regulatory  requirements,  the funds we receive from
the sale of our capital  stock will  further  strengthen  our capital  position.
These  funds  may be used for  general  corporate  purposes  including,  but not
limited to: (i) repaying FHLB  advances,  (ii) funding loan  commitments;  (iii)
investment in mortgage-backed securities; (iv) investment in mortgages and other
loans; and (v) possible expansion of our banking facilities.  However, initially
we intend to invest the net  proceeds  in  short-term  investments  until we can
deploy  the  proceeds  pursuant  to  our  business  plan.  Our  plan  calls  for
diversification of our lending products into commercial/small  business lending.
It also  anticipates  our  opening a branch or  branches  in the next two years.
Branch expansion, however, is dependent upon finding a suitable location for the
facilities, the cost of constructing,  purchasing or leasing such a facility and
general economic conditions, including the level of interest rates. Accordingly,
there is no assurance that expansion will be achieved in the near future,  if at
all. We also plan to  increase  our home  equity  lending  program and enter new
lines of lending.

     After the first year  following the  Conversion (or sooner if authorized by
the OTS),  the  Company may  repurchase  shares of our Common  Stock  subject to
applicable  regulations of the OTS governing such  repurchases.  The decision to
repurchase  our Common Stock will be made by our Board of Directors  and will be
based on our board's  view of the price of the Common  Stock,  general  economic
conditions,  the  attractiveness of other investments and our capital needs. Any
decision  to  repurchase  stock  will be  subject  to the  determination  of the
Company's  Board of Directors that both the Company and Ninth Ward Savings Bank,
FSB will be  capitalized  in excess of all  applicable  regulatory  requirements
after such repurchases and the receipt of necessary  approvals or non-objections
from the OTS. The  repurchase  of stock would also be prohibited if equity would
be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation  account.  There can be
no assurance that the Company will repurchase any shares.

     The net proceeds may vary because the total  expenses of the Conversion may
be more or less than those  estimated.  We expect our  estimated  expenses to be
between  $502,000 and $539,000.  Our estimated net proceeds will range from $6.9
million to $9.5 million (or up to $11.0  million in the event the maximum of the
estimated valuation range is increased to $11.6 million).  See ""PRO FORMA DATA.""
The net  proceeds  will  also  vary if the  number of shares to be issued in the
Conversion  is adjusted to reflect a change in our  estimated  pro forma  market
value.  Payments  for shares made  through  withdrawals  from  existing  deposit
accounts  with us will not result in the receipt of new funds for  investment by
us but will result in a reduction of our  liabilities  and  interest  expense as
funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or accounts."

Offering  Range by 15%).  See ""Pro  Forma  Data"" as to the  assumptions  used to
arrive at such amounts.

         The Company  will use at least 50% of the net  proceeds to purchase all
of the capital  stock of the Bank and will use the balance of the net  proceeds,
less  the  amount  of the  loan  by the  Company  to the  ESOP,  as its  initial
capitalization. The net proceeds contributed to the Bank will become part of the
Bank's  general funds for use in its business,  through its current  activities,
subject to applicable regulatory  restrictions.  The portion of the net proceeds
retained  by the  Company  initially  may  be  used  to,  among  other  possible
investments,  invest in U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various
maturities,   high-grade  short-term  and  medium-term   marketable  securities,
adjustable and fixed
rate mortgage-backed securities, equity securities,  deposits of or loans to the
Bank,  a  combination  thereof  or to repay  existing  borrowings.  The Bank may
likewise use the proceeds it receives to, among other things, repay a portion of
its  borrowings  from the  FHLB,  invest in high  grade  securities  of  various
maturities,   including   federal   government   and  agency   securities,   and
mortgage-backed  securities or it may use the proceeds in a combination thereof.
Ultimately, the portion of net proceeds retained by the Company may be used: (i)
to fund the 1998 RSP ($1,122,000  and $1,518,000  based on the sale of 2,805,000
and 3,795,000  shares of Conversion Stock at $10.00 per share at the minimum and
maximum of the Offering Range, respectively), (ii) to support the Bank's lending
activities,   (iii)  to  support   future   expansion  of   operations   through
establishment of additional branch offices or other customer facilities, (iv) to
support  acquisitions of other financial  service  organizations,  such as other
mutual or stock savings institutions and commercial banks, (v) to support future
expansion into other lending  markets,  (vi) to support  future  diversification
into  other  banking  related  businesses  (although  no such  transactions  are
specifically  being  considered at this time),  and (vii) for other business and
investment   purposes,   including  the  possible  payment  of  dividends,   and
repurchases of the Common Stock.  The Company  intends to lend funds to the ESOP
sufficient  to enable the ESOP to  purchase  up to 8% of the  Conversion  Stock.
Based upon the sale of 2,805,000 or 3,795,000  shares of Conversion Stock at the
minimum and maximum of the Offering Range, respectively, the loan to the ESOP to
purchase  8% of the  Conversion  Stock  would  be  approximately  $2,244,000  or
$3,036,000, respectively. The ESOP loan is currently expected to be for 10 years
at an adjustable  interest rate approximately  equal to the prime rate published
in The Wall Street Journal.

         Upon  completion of the  Conversion  and  Reorganization,  the Board of
Directors will have the authority to adopt stock  repurchase  plans,  subject to
any  applicable  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements.  Based upon facts and
circumstances which may arise following Conversion and Reorganization, the Board
of Directors  may determine to  repurchase  stock in the future.  Such facts and
circumstances  may  include,  but are not  limited  to, (i) market and  economic
factors  such as the price at which  the stock is  trading  in the  market,  the
volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment  alternatives in terms
of the rate of return  and risk  involved  in the  investment,  the  ability  to
increase the book value and/or  earnings per share of the remaining  outstanding
shares, and an improvement in the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance
of dilution to  stockholders by not having to issue  additional  shares to cover
the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans;  or (iii)
any other  circumstances in which  repurchases would be in the best interests of

be determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated 
that the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock (after the expenses of 
the Conversion are deducted) will be between $39.4 million and $53.7 million, 
with a midpoint of $46.6 million. In the event that the Estimated Price Range 
is increased by 15%, the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock (after 
the expenses of the Conversion are deducted) are estimated to be $62.0 million. 
See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion -- Stock Pricing"" for a discussion of 
the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Company will be unable to 
utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offerings until the consummation of the 
Conversion. 

The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock as follows: 

1. The Company will purchase all of the capital stock of the Bank to be issued 
in the Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the Offerings. 

2. The remaining net proceeds will be retained by the Company. Net proceeds to 
be retained by the Company after the purchase of the capital stock of the Bank 
are estimated to be between $19.7 million and $26.9 million, with a midpoint of 
$23.3 million. In the event that the Estimated Price Range is increased by 15%, 
the net proceeds retained by the Company are estimated to be $31.0 million. The 
net proceeds retained by the Company will be used for general business 
activities and will initially be invested primarily in federal funds, 
government and federal agency mortgage-backed securities, other debt securities, 
equity securities, deposits of or loans to the Bank, or a combination thereof. 

3. The Company intends to use a portion of the retained net proceeds to make a 
loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of the Common Stock 
to be issued in the Conversion, including shares issued to the Foundation. 
Based upon the issuance of 4,122,500 shares or 5,577,500 shares at the minimum 
and maximum of the Estimated Price Range, respectively, the amount of the loan 
to the ESOP (if the loan is made by the Company and not a third party) would be 
$3.4 million or $4.6 million, respectively (or $5.3 million if the Estimated 
Price Range is increased by 15%), if shares are acquired at the Purchase Price, 
to be repaid over a period of up to 10 years at an interest rate of 8%. See 
""Management of the Bank -- Benefits -- Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust.
"" 

The portion of the net proceeds received by the Bank from the Company's 
purchase of the Bank's capital stock, estimated to be between $19.7 million at 
the minimum of the Estimated Price Range and $26.9 million at the maximum of 
the Estimated Price Range, will be added to the Bank's general funds to be used 
for general corporate purposes, including: investment in one- to four-family 
residential mortgage loans, commercial and other loans; investment in federal 
funds, short- to intermediate-term investment-grade marketable securities, 
mortgage-backed and equity securities; and to fund the RRP. The Bank may also 
use such funds for the expansion of its facilities, the relocation of its 
Middletown branch and to expand operations through acquisitions of other 
financial institutions, branch offices or other financial services companies. 
See ""Business of the Bank -- Properties."" The net proceeds may also be used to 
purchase or lease additional branch or office facilities inside or outside of 
Orange County, New York. The Bank has recently obtained a license from the New 
Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance to establish a mortgage banking 
operation in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex Counties, New Jersey through its 
mortgage banking subsidiary, WSB Mortgage. Except for the establishment of 
mortgage banking operations in New Jersey, the Bank has no current agreements, 
arrangements or understandings regarding any establishment or acquisition or 
any other transaction related to the possible expansion of its operations. 
The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the future 
expansion of the Bank's operations through branch acquisitions and the 
acquisition of other financial institutions or diversification into other 
banking related businesses and for other business or investment purposes, 
including possibly the payment of dividends and the repurchase of the Company's 
Common Stock as permitted by the Superintendent. See ""Dividend Policy"" and 
""Regulation and Supervision -- New York Banking Regulation -- Dividends."" The 
Company has no current arrangements, understandings or agreements, written or 
oral, regarding any such transactions. The Company, upon completion of the 
Conversion, will be a bank holding company under federal law, which, under 
existing laws, generally would be restricted as to the types of business 
activities in which it may engage. See ""Regulation and Supervision -- Holding 
Company Regulation"" for a description of certain regulations applicable to the 
Company. In determining the amount of net proceeds to be used to purchase the 
capital stock of the Bank, consideration was given to such factors as the 
regulatory capital position of the Bank, both before and after giving effect to 
the Conversion, and the rules and regulations and policies of the New York 
Banking Board (""NYBB"") and the FDIC governing the amount of proceeds that may 
be retained by the Company. 
Upon completion of the Conversion, the Company's Board of Directors will have 
the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and 
regulatory restrictions and other requirements. Based upon facts and 
circumstances that may arise following the Conversion, and subject to applicable 
regulatory requirements, the Company's Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include: 
(i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment, 
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares and improvement in the Company's return on equity; 
(ii) the avoidance of dilution to shareholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans; and (iii) any other circumstances under which repurchases would be in 
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In the event the 
Company determines to repurchase stock, such repurchases will generally be made 
at market prices, which could be in excess of the Purchase Price in the 
Conversion. 

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Company's 
Board of Directors that both the Company and the Bank will be capitalized in 
excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and 
that such capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, 
the level of non-performing and other risk assets, the Company's and the Bank's 
current and projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the 
economic environment and tax and other considerations. In addition, the FDIC 
prohibits an insured mutual state savings bank that has converted from mutual 
to stock form of ownership from repurchasing its capital stock within one year 
following the date of its conversion to stock form, except that stock 
repurchases of no greater than 5% of a bank's outstanding capital stock may be 
repurchased during this one-year period where compelling and valid business 
reasons are established to the satisfaction of the FDIC. NYBB regulations also 
include restrictions on repurchases of stock within the first three years 
following conversion. Further, the Company may not repurchase any of its Common 
Stock if the repurchases would cause the Bank to become ""undercapitalized"" 
within the meaning of the FDIC prompt corrective action regulation. See 
""Regulation and Supervision -- Federal Banking Regulation -- Prompt Corrective 
Action."" 

The Board of Directors of the Company intends to consider a policy of paying 
cash dividends on the Common Stock in the future. However, no decision has been 
made as to the amount or timing of such dividends, if any. The payment of 
dividends or repurchase of stock, however, would be prohibited if shareholders' 
equity would be reduced below the amount required to maintain the Bank's 
liquidation account. See ""Dividend Policy,"" ""The Conversion -- Certain 
Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After Conversion"" and 
""-- Effects of Conversion -- Liquidation Rights."" 

Neither the Bank nor the Company has yet determined the approximate amount of 
net proceeds to be used for each of the purposes mentioned above."

the ESOP would be $26.5 million and $35.9 million, respectively. The remaining 
net proceeds retained by the Company initially may be used to invest in 
investment securities, mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government and federal 
agency securities of various maturities, deposits in either the Bank or other 
financial institutions, or a combination thereof. The portion of the net proceed
s retained by the Company may ultimately be used to support the Bank's lending 
activities, to support the future expansion of operations through acquisitions 
of other financial institutions or branch offices (although no such transactions
 are specifically being considered at this time), and for other business and 
investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special cash dividends,
 possible repurchases of the Common Stock or returns of capital (the Company 
and the Bank have committed that no return of capital will be made on the 
Common Stock during the one-year period subsequent to consummation of the

should such opportunities become available. Neither the Bank nor the Company has
 any specific plans, arrangements or understandings regarding any acquisitions 
or diversification of activities at this time, nor have criteria been 
established to identify potential candidates for acquisition.

circumstances, the Company's Board of Directors may determine to repurchase 
some shares of Common Stock, subject to any applicable statutory and regulatory 
requirements. Such facts and circumstances may include but not be limited to 
(i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in the Company's return on 
equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue 
additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee 
stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases 
would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Any stock 
repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Company's Board of 
Directors that the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable 
regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. The payment of dividends or 
repurchase of stock, however, would be prohibited if the Bank's net worth would 
be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account to be 
established for the benefit of Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental 
Eligible Account Holders. As of April 30, 1997, the initial balance of the 
liquidation account would be approximately $177.3 million. See ""Dividend 
Policy,"" ""The Conversion - Liquidation Rights"" and ""The Conversion - Certain 
Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After the Conversion."" 

The Company will be a unitary savings and loan holding company which, under 
existing laws, would generally not be restricted as to the types of business 
activities in which it may engage, provided that the Bank continues to be a 
qualified thrift lender (""QTL""). See 

""Regulation - Regulation of Savings and Loan Holding Companies"" for a 
description of certain regulations applicable to the Company. 
The portion of the net proceeds used by the Company to purchase the capital 
stock of the Bank will be added to the Bank's general funds to be used for 
general corporate purposes, including increased lending activities and 
purchases of securities. While the amount of net proceeds received by the Bank 
will further strengthen the Bank's capital position, which already 
substantially exceeds all regulatory requirements, it should be noted that the 
Bank is not converting primarily to raise capital. After the Conversion, the 
Bank's tangible capital ratio will be 14.0% (based upon the midpoint of the 
Estimated Valuation Range). As a result, the Bank will be a well-capitalized 
institution. After the Conversion, the Bank intends to emphasize capital 
strength and growth in assets and earnings. 

THE NET PROCEEDS MAY VARY BECAUSE TOTAL EXPENSES OF THE CONVERSION MAY BE MORE 
OR LESS THAN THOSE ESTIMATED. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of 
shares to be issued in the Conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in the 
estimated pro forma market value of the Bank. Payments for shares made through 
withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at the Bank will not result in the 
receipt of new funds for investment by the Bank but will result in a reduction 
of the Bank's interest expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from 
interest-bearing certificates or other deposit accounts."

operating plans and certain strategic assumptions, including those relating to 
the Company's future revenue levels and expenditures, and industry and general 
economic and other conditions. Although the Company does not contemplate any 
material changes in the proposed use of proceeds, since the proposed uses of 
proceeds are based on assumptions concerning future events and conditions, many

among the uses indicated above or, if business conditions make it necessary or 
advisable, in management's opinion, to do so, certain portions of the net

if the Company's revenues in future periods were less than anticipated, 
management might increase its allocation of funds to marketing and advertising 
in an effort to increase sales. Alternatively, management might decrease the 
allocation of funds for that purpose if, in the circumstances, management 
believed that reduced sales levels would not support previously budgeted 
marketing and advertising expenses. In the latter case, funds previously 
allocated for marketing and advertising might be reallocated to research and 
development to pursue the identification and development of new products, or to 
accelerate ongoing research and development activities. By way of further 
illustration, if manufacturing and inventory costs associated with new products 
were higher than anticipated, management might be required to scale back 
operations in the areas affected, or to reallocate funds to manufacturing and 
inventory which previously had been allocated to other uses.

retain $815,000, $891,000, $966,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, at the 
minimum, midpoint, maximum and maximum, as adjusted, of the Estimated Valuation 
Range. The balance will be used to purchase all of the capital stock we will 
issue in connection with the conversion. A portion of the net proceeds to be 
retained by the Company will be lent to our ESOP to fund its purchase of 8% of 
the shares sold in the conversion. On a short-term basis, the balance of the 
net proceeds retained by the Company initially will be invested in short- term 
investments. The net proceeds subsequently may be used to fund acquisitions of 
other financial services institutions or to diversify into non-banking 
activities, although we have no current plans or agreements to do so. Subject 
to applicable regulatory restrictions, the net proceeds may also serve as a 
source of funds for the repurchase of shares or for the payment of dividends to 
stockholders, although the Company has not yet adopted a dividend policy. A 
portion of the net proceeds may also be used to fund the purchase of 4.0% of 
the shares for the MRP, which is anticipated to be adopted following the 
conversion. See ""Pro Forma Data."" 

The funds we receive from the sale of our capital stock to the Company will be 
added to our general funds and be used for general corporate purposes including: 
(i) investment in mortgages and other loans, (ii) U.S. Government and federal 
agency securities, (iii) mortgage-backed securities, (iv) funding loan 
commitments or (v) repaying FHLB advances. However, initially, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in short-term investments until we can deploy the 
proceeds into higher yielding loans. The funds added to our capital will 
further strengthen our capital position. 
The net proceeds may vary because the total expenses of the conversion may be 
more or less than those estimated. We expect our estimated expenses to be 
$400,000. Our estimated net proceeds will range from $2.0 million to 
$2.8 million (or up to $3.3 million in the event the maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range is increased to $3.7 million). See ""Pro Forma Data."" The net 
proceeds will also vary if the number of shares to be issued in the conversion 
is adjusted to reflect a change in our estimated pro forma market value. 
Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts 
with us will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by us but 
will result in a reduction of our liabilities and interest expense as funds are 
transferred from interest-bearing certificates or accounts. 

For a period of one year following the completion of the conversion, we will 
not pay any dividends that would be construed as a return of capital nor take 
any actions to pursue or propose such dividends."

create a public market for the Company's Common Stock and to facilitate future 
access to public markets. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Company has no 
specific plans to use the net proceeds from this offering other than as set 
forth below. 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds for repayment of all 
amounts outstanding under a $2.0 million revolving line of credit expiring in 
September 1998. In October 1997, the Company borrowed $1.7 million under this 
revolving line of credit, bearing an annual interest rate of 1.75% over the 
bank's prime lending rate. The Company also expects to use a portion of the net 
proceeds for repayment of a $400,000 term loan, bearing interest at 1.75% over 
the bank's prime lending rate, undertaken to finance its capital expenditure 
commitments. The Company also expects to use a portion of the net proceeds for 
repayment of a subordinated promissory note, the outstanding principal balance 
of which at October 31, 1997 was $1.1 million, and which bears interest at the 
annual rate of 13.5%. 

The Company expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general 
corporate purposes (primarily working capital and, to a lesser extent, 
expansion of the Company's sales, marketing and customer support 
infrastructure). Furthermore, from time to time the Company expects to evaluate 
the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies that complement the 
Company's business, for which a portion of the net proceeds may be used. 
Currently, however, the Company does not have any understandings, commitments 
or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions. Pending use of the net 
proceeds for the above purposes, the Company plans to invest the net proceeds

repay all borrowings under its credit facility, which totaled $3.5 million at 
November 10, 1997 (borrowings totaled $2.8 million at September 30, 1997). As 
of November 10, 1997, the revolving and term components of the current credit 
facility bore interest at 10.00% and 10.25% per annum, respectively, and mature
 in December 1998. Following such repayment, the Company will maintain the 
credit facility through its term to fund future financing requirements. The 
Company has used the proceeds from borrowings to fund working capital 
requirements, the growth of the business and selective acquisitions. For a 
description of the terms of the credit facility, see ""Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and 
Capital Resources."" The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds from 
this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which 
may include the acquisition of capital equipment and leasehold improvements 
totaling approximately $800,000. In the normal course of business, the Company 
evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses that would complement or expand 
the Company's business. A portion of the net proceeds may be used for one or 
more such acquisitions, although the Company has no present commitments or 
agreements with respect to any such acquisitions and no portion of the net 
proceeds has been allocated for any specific acquisition. Pending such uses, 
the Company intends to invest the remaining net proceeds of this offering in 
investment-grade securities, including short-term, interest-bearing money market
 funds."

The Company intends to use approximately $4.9 million of the net proceeds of the Offering to manufacture and
 deploy additional L-VIS Units. This amount includes the capital cost of the equipment and facilities,
 and the personnel costs associated with fabrication, testing and service of L-VIS Units. The cost of customer 
training, end-user support and equipment service are also included. 

The Company intends to spend approximately $4.2 million of the net proceeds of the Offering to fund its research 
and development activities, including enhancement of the L-VIS System. Such costs will also include personnel 
costs associated with quality assurance, software engineering and hardware engineering. The Company also plans 
to continue to seek intellectual property protection through trademarks and patents. The Company intends to 
continue to retain outside consultants as necessary in order to address specific research and development needs
 when it is cost effective to do so. 

Approximately $3.3 million of the net proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay the Bridge Notes in full, 
including accrued and unpaid interest thereon and payment of a five percent fee to Barington. The Bridge Notes

A significant increase in personnel is projected in the marketing and customer relations areas. Approximately 
$2.1 million of the net proceeds of the Offering will be spent to enhance sales and marketing capabilities

regulatory capital and support future growth of the Bank, including development

the Rights Offering, the Community Offering and the Syndicated Community 
Offering and the amount of the actual expenses incurred in the Offering, which

Total Minimum of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock and the sale of the Total 
Maximum of 2,701,619 shares of Common Stock in the Offering. In determining net 
proceeds, the estimated expenses of the Offering have been subtracted from 
gross proceeds. In estimating the expenses of the Offering, the following 
assumptions have been utilized: (i) 15% of the shares of Common Stock will be 
sold to Shareholders in the Rights Offering, of which 5% of the shares will be 
sold to directors, officers and employees of the Company for which KBW will 
receive a commission of 2% of the aggregate Subscription Price of such shares, 
excluding the shares sold to directors, officers and employees; (ii) the 
remaining 85% of shares of Common Stock will be sold in the Community Offering 
or Syndicated Community Offering for which KBW will receive a commission of 7% 
of the aggregate Subscription Price of such shares, excluding the shares sold 
to directors, officers and employees of Federal Trust; and (iii) the estimated 
expenses of the Offering, including the fees paid to KBW described above.

sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders. See ""Principal and Selling 
Stockholders."" 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase the Company's equity 
capital, to create a public market for the Company's Common Stock, to 
facilitate future access by the Company to public equity markets, to provide 
liquidity to existing stockholders, to provide increased visibility and 
credibility in a marketplace where many of its current and potential 
competitors are or will be publicly held companies, and to enhance the ability 
of the Company to use its Common Stock as consideration for acquisitions and as 
a means of attracting and retaining key employees. 

The Company expects to use the net proceeds from this offering for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company has not as yet 
identified specific uses for such proceeds and will have discretion over their 
use and investment. Pending use of the net proceeds, the Company intends to 
invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment grade, 
interest-bearing instruments. See ""Risk Factors -- Broad Discretion as to Use 
of Proceeds."" 

The Company intends to seek acquisitions of businesses, products and 
technologies that are complementary to those of the Company, and a portion of 
the net proceeds may also be used for such acquisitions. While the Company 
engages from time to time in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions,
 the Company has no plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any such 
acquisitions as of the date of this Prospectus, and there can be no assurances

its manufacturing facility for its surgical sealant products. The balance of 
the net proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate 
purposes. Although the Company may use a portion of the net proceeds for the 
licensing or acquisition of new products or technologies from others, the 
Company currently has no specific commitments in this regard. The amounts 
actually expended for each purpose and the timing of such expenditures may vary

December 1, 2001, February 1, 2002, March 1, 2002, May 1, 2002 and August 1, 
2002, respectively. Proceeds from these loans were used to purchase, and the 
notes are collateralized by, various seismic drilling and support equipment. 
The Company will incur a prepayment penalty of 2.0% of the outstanding balance 
at the time it repays the indebtedness (approximately $92,000 at November 30, 
1997). 
(b) Matures on January 3, 2000. Proceeds from this loan were used to 
consolidate financing incurred to purchase 43 trucks, which, together with bank 
deposit accounts, serve as collateral for the loan. 
(c) Matures on April 1, 2000. Proceeds of this loan were used to finance three 
years of the Company's insurance premiums. 
(d) Consists of 20 separate motor vehicle loans incurred to purchase 34 trucks,
 which, along with bank deposit accounts, serve as collateral for the loans. 
The loans range in maturity from September 17, 1999 to September 17, 2000 and 
bear interest at 9.0%, except for one loan of $18,933 which bears interest at 
8.5%. 
(e) Bears interest at the lesser of the prime rate as quoted from time to time 
by Citibank, N.A. New York (""Citibank Prime"") plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 3.5% and 
matures on November 1, 1998. The revolving line of credit provides up to $8.0 
million (subject to a borrowing base limitation of 80% of eligible trade 
receivables) that can be used for general working capital requirements and the 
issuance of letters of credit. The loan is secured by the Company's accounts 
receivable, general intangibles, its Carencro facilities and by the collateral 
securing the other Company loans with Hibernia National Bank. In addition, the 
Company has granted Hibernia National Bank a mortgage on the 34 acres of land 
it owns adjacent to its Carencro facility. This mortgage also secures the loans 
described in notes (g) and (h). 
(f) Includes $762,000 that was borrowed after November 30, 1997. Bears interest 
at the lesser of Citibank Prime plus 0.75% or LIBOR plus 3.75% and matures five

 new administrative and fabrication and maintenance buildings, which 
collateralize the loan. 


(g) Bears interest at the lesser of Citibank Prime plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 
3.0% and matures on August 6, 2002. Proceeds of this loan were used to fund a 
portion of the purchase price for substantially all of the assets of American 
Aviation. The loan is collateralized by the assets of the Company's aviation 
division and by the collateral securing the other Company loans with Hibernia 
National Bank. The Company will incur a prepayment penalty of 1.0% of the 
prepayment amount (approximately $65,000 at November 30, 1997). 
(h) Consists of three separate loans owed by Leonard J. Chauvin, Jr., Inc., 
including a $40,000 note for working capital purposes, a $12,121 loan incurred 
to purchase a boat and a $24,161 loan incurred to purchase an automobile. 
(i) Matures on June 30, 2001. This promissory note was issued to OGC as part of 
the consideration for the OGC Acquisition. See ""Certain Transactions."" 
(j) Payable on demand. This promissory note was issued in connection with the 
acquisition of substantially all of the assets of American Aviation. 
(k) Matures on July 1, 1998. Proceeds were used to finance one year of premiums 
for seven of the Company's insurance policies. 
The Company will use the remaining estimated net proceeds, approximately $5.1 
million, to repay a portion of the Company's equipment financing loan with The 
CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc., together with prepayment penalties and 
accrued interest thereon. As of November 30, 1997, there was approximately $7.1 
million outstanding under this loan. Of the principal outstanding, $5,244,992 
bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.75% (the ""Variable Rate"") and matures on July 19,
 2001. Prior to August 19, 1998, the Company may elect to pay interest on this 
portion of the loan at a fixed rate equal to the interest rate on U.S. Treasury 
securities of a comparable maturity to the loan at the time of election plus 
4.25% (the ""Fixed Rate""). The Company will incur a prepayment penalty of up to 
5% on any portion of this principal amount that is prepaid. The proceeds of this
 portion of the loan were used to finance a portion of the OGC Acquisition, and 
the assets acquired serve as collateral for the loan. 

The remaining portion of this loan was borrowed pursuant to an additional 
commitment from the lender of up to $4,000,000 or 90% of the cost of the 
collateral securing amounts advanced under this new commitment. As of November 
30, 1997, $1,811,333 of this commitment had been advanced. Amounts advanced 
under this commitment bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.0% and are collateralized 
by various seismic drilling and support equipment. The Company will incur a 
prepayment penalty of 2.0% of the outstanding balance upon repayment. 

Any proceeds received from the exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment 
option will be used to repay the remaining indebtedness to The CIT 
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc., with any remaining proceeds to be used for 
working capital and general corporate purposes."

 Stock offered hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated 
offering expenses, are approximately $31.1 million ($36.3 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of this amount, 
approximately $28.7 million will be used to fund the Acquisitions, including: 
(i) the $25.4 million cash portion of the purchase price for the Founding 
Companies; (ii) $2.8 million of indebtedness net of cash acquired (based upon 
the September 30, 1997 relevant account balances) to be assumed from the 
Founding Companies and repaid by the Company; and (iii) $0.5 million to pay the
 transaction fees associated with the Acquisitions. 

The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which 
are expected to include future acquisitions. Pending such uses, the net proceeds
 will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade securities. 
The Company intends to enter into the Credit Facility to assist in the funding 
of future acquisitions and operating activities. The Company also may utilize 
Common Stock to fund future acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the 
Credit Facility or the Common Stock will be sufficient to fund the Company's 
needs. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Company has no commitments or 
agreements with respect to any acquisitions other than of the Founding Companies
. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
of Operations - Pro Forma Combined Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

Of the cash portion of the purchase price, approximately $7.3 million represents
 the purchase price to be paid for certain Founding Companies which are 
affiliated with persons who are or will become officers, directors or 5% 
shareholders of the Company. Of the indebtedness to be repaid (which was used 
for working capital, equipment purchases and general corporate purposes), 
approximately $3.1 million (as of September 30, 1997) is an obligation of a 
Founding Company whose shareholder is a Director of the Company and 
approximately $77,000 (as of September 30, 1997) is comprised of obligations of 
two Founding Companies, certain shareholders of which are to be elected as 
Directors of the Company upon consummation of the Offering. See ""The Company"" 
and ""Certain Transactions."" The indebtedness to be repaid from the proceeds of 
the Offering bears effective interest rates ranging from approximately 4% to 
12%. Such indebtedness would otherwise mature at various dates through 2010. 
The consideration to be paid for the Founding Companies was determined through 
arm's length negotiations among ImageMax and representatives of the Founding 
Companies. See ""Certain Transactions."""

     Upon satisfaction of all of the conditions discussed in ""The
Offering -- Conditions to the Offering and Release of Funds,"" all subscription
funds held in escrow will be released and will become capital of the Company.
The gross proceeds to the Company from the sale of the shares offered hereby
will be between $6,100,000 and $12,000,000. The Company will use a portion of
the offering proceeds to pay (or reimburse the organizers for) the
organizational and offering expenses of the Company and the organizational and
pre-opening expenses of the Bank (which are described in the following section) 
through the date of the release of funds held in escrow. The organizational and 
offering expenses of the Company will consist primarily of legal, accounting, 
marketing, and printing expenses, and the Company anticipates that they will not
exceed $75,000. The Company will use approximately $875,000 for the purchase of 
the facilities for the Bank's offices. The Company has obtained an $875,000 loan
from Carolina First Bank to purchase these facilities and will use a portion of
the offering proceeds to repay this loan. The loan has a six month term, with a
single payment of all interest and principal due at that time. Interest accrues
at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal.

     After payment of these expenses, the Company will use a minimum of
$6,000,000 and a maximum of $7,000,000 of the gross proceeds to purchase all of
the capital stock of the Bank. The Company will retain the balance of the
proceeds and intends initially to invest them in United States government
securities or as a deposit with the Bank. In the long-term, the Company will use
these sums for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including
payment of expenses of the Company and the provision of additional capital for
the Bank, if necessary. Subject to regulatory approval, the Company may also use
such proceeds for potential expansion opportunities, such as the establishment
of additional branches, the acquisition of other financial institutions, or the
establishment of mortgage banking services. The Company does not currently have
any definitive plans regarding any such expansion possibilities.

     The following table sets forth the anticipated use of proceeds by the
Company based on the sale of the minimum number and maximum number of shares in
this offering.

(1) Assumes that 610,000 shares of Common Stock are sold in this offering. 
(2) Assumes that 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock are sold in this offering. 
(3) If sufficient proceeds from the offering are available, the Company will

above from Carolina First Bank. 

BY THE BANK 
The Bank currently plans to use up to approximately $250,000 of the proceeds it 
receives from the sale of its stock to the Company to reimburse the Company and 
the Organizers for amounts advanced by the Company and the Organizers to pay 
organizational and pre-opening expenses of the Bank. Organizational expenses of 
the Bank, estimated at $25,000, include consulting fees, expenses for market 
analysis and feasibility studies, and legal fees and expenses. Pre-opening 
expenses, estimated at $225,000, include officers' and employees' salaries and 
benefits (assuming the Bank opens for business on its target date of August 1997). 
In addition, the Company anticipates that approximately $250,000 will be used 
for renovation of the Bank's offices. For furniture, fixtures, and equipment 
(including computer equipment) for the offices, the Bank expects to spend 
approximately $500,000 in 1997. If there are not sufficient proceeds from the 
offering for the Company to repay the $875,000 loan (plus interest) from 
Carolina First Bank used to purchase the facilities, then the properties will 
be assigned to the Bank and the Bank will repay the loan. The balance of the 
proceeds to be received by the Bank and available for use in the first year 
(estimated at $4,185,000 if the minimum number of shares is sold and $6,000,000 
if the maximum number is sold) will be used for loans to customers, investments, 
and other general corporate purposes. 

The following table depicts the anticipated use of proceeds by the Bank. All 
proceeds received by the Bank will be in the form of an investment by the 
Company in the Bank's capital stock.

Although the amounts set forth above provide an indication of the proposed use 
of funds based on the Organizers' plans and estimates, actual expenses may vary 
from the estimates. These estimates were based on assumptions that the 
Organizers believed were reasonable, but as to which no assurances can be given. 
The Organizers believe that the estimated minimum net proceeds of the offering 
will satisfy the cash requirements of the Company and the Bank for their 
respective first five years of operations and that neither the Company nor the 
Bank will need to raise additional funds for operations during this period, but 
there can be no assurance that this will be the case."

Stock offered hereby are estimated to be $30.8 million at the initial offering 
price of $9.00 per share ($35.5 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment 
option is exercised in full). Of the net proceeds to be received by the Company,
 approximately $12.4 million will be used to repay a portion of the outstanding 
principal amount of the AAA Notes, and approximately $13.0 million will be used 
to repay outstanding indebtedness including amounts owed under a revolving 
credit facility and long-term note arrangement with the Company's principal bank
s (the ""Banks""). The net proceeds will also be used to pay when due the 
remaining $5.2 million outstanding principal amount of the AAA Notes 
(approximately $1.0 million due on December 31, 1997 and the balance of $4.2 
million due on April 15, 1998), which amount approximates the income tax 
liability of Industrial's shareholders for income earned from January 1, 1997 
through the termination of S Corporation status. Of the approximate $17.6 
million of net proceeds to be received by existing shareholders as repayment of 
the AAA Notes, approximately $13.8 million, $2.1 million and $1.7 million will 
be received by Monte R. Black, Susan K. Black and The Monte R. Black and Susan 
K. Black 1994 Irrevocable Trust, respectively. The remaining net proceeds, if 
any, will be used for general corporate purposes. Pending specific application 
of the net proceeds, the Company intends to invest unused net proceeds in 
short-term investment grade securities or money market instruments. 

As of September 30, 1997, the Company's revolving credit facility had an 
outstanding balance of $7.1 million and a weighted average interest rate of 
7.06%. The revolving credit facility bears interest at the prime rate less 0.5%
 or, at the Company's option, the Eurodollar market rate plus 1.0%. Under the 
long-term note arrangement, the Company entered into promissory notes with the 
Banks with an aggregate outstanding balance as of September 30, 1997 of $5.9 
million. The long-term notes bear interest at the prime rate less 0.25% or, at 
the Company's option, the Eurodollar market rate plus 1.25%. The weighted 
average interest rate for the notes as of September 30, 1997 was 6.91%."

approximately $19,000,000, $8,800,000 of which will be used to repay outstanding
Subordinated Debentures (""Subordinated Debt""), $7,200,000 of which will be used 
to retire a bank term loan (the ""Term Loan"") and a portion of which will be 
used to repay the total outstanding balance due under terms of the Company's 
revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Line of Credit""). At November 25, 
1997, the Company had borrowings of $3,000,000 outstanding under the revolving 
Line of Credit. The balance of the net proceeds, if any, will be used for 
working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Of the $8,800,000 which will be used to repay the Subordinated Debt, $8,501,000 
will be paid to the following affiliates of directors and former directors of 
the Company in the indicated amounts: Grotech Partners IV, L.P. ($3,588,000); 
Keystone Ventures IV, L.P. ($753,000); Stolberg Partners, L.P. ($2,803,000); 
Richard K. McDonald ($460,000); and Constitution Partners I, L.P. ($897,000). 
The balance of the Subordinated Debt is held by Needham Capital Partners, L.P. 
and Penn Janney Fund, Inc. The following directors are affiliated with the 
following entities: Dennis J. Shaughnessy and J. Roger Sullivan, Jr. (Grotech 
Partners IV, L.P., Grotech Partners III, L.P., Grotech III Companion Fund, L.P. 
and Grotech III Pennsylvania Fund, L.P.); Richard K. McDonald (M&M General 
Partnership and Constitution Partners I, L.P.); and G. Kenneth Macrae (Keystone 
Ventures IV, L.P.). 

The Subordinated Debt is subordinate to the Term Loan and the Revolving Line of 
Credit. See ""Certain Transactions."" The Subordinated Debt bears interest at the 
rate of 12% per annum and is due and payable in full on March 1, 1998. 

The Term Loan, which is owed to Commerce Bank, N.A., carries a floating rate of 
1.5% above the prime rate, which was 8.5% on July 31, 1997. Payments under the 
Term Loan are due quarterly, with a final payment due December 31, 2001. 
The Term Loan is secured by substantially all the assets of the Company. 

The Revolving Line of Credit, which is also owed to Commerce Bank, N.A., carries
a floating interest rate of 1% above the prime rate and is due in December 1998 
subject to certain renewal provisions. The Revolving Line of Credit is secured 
by substantially all the assets of the Company. 

Upon repayment of the Term Loan and the Revolving Line of Credit concurrent 
with the offering, the Company will record a one-time write-off of unamortized 
loan fees which total approximately $300,000 as of July 31, 1997. 

The Company intends to seek acquisitions of retail optical stores that are 
complementary to the Company and a portion of the net proceeds may be used for 
such acquisitions. Although the Company from time to time engages in discussions
regarding potential acquisitions and strategic affiliations, the Company is not 
currently a party to any letter of intent or definitive purchase agreement with 
respect to any material acquisition. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends 
to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing investment grade 
securities."

from $9.3 million, at the minimum of the Updated Offering Price Range, to 
$12.7 million, at the maximum of the Updated Offering Price Range. At the 
midpoint of the Updated Offering Price Range, the estimated net proceeds from 
the sale of the Conversion Stock would be $11.0 million. 

The Holding Company plans to contribute to the Association $4.6 million, 
$5.5 million and $10.7 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 
Conversion Stock at the minimum, midpoint and maximum of the Updated Offering 
Price Range, respectively, and to retain the remainder of the net proceeds. The 
Holding Company plans to contribute a greater portion of the net proceeds to 
the Association at the maximum of the Updated Offering Price Range in order to 
achieve a greater than 10% tangible capital ratio, which, in turn, will permit 
the ESOP and the 1997 MRP to be funded with a greater amount of Common Stock. 
See ""Benefits to Directors and Executive Officers--Employee Stock Ownership 
Plan;"" ""--1997 Management Recognition Plan."" Assuming that the Conversion and 
Reorganization is consummated at the maximum of the Updated Offering Price 
Range, the Association will receive approximately $10.7 million and the Holding 
Company will retain approximately $2.0 million, out of which the Holding 
Company will make a loan to the Association's ESOP in the amount of $1,334,000 
and fund the 1997 MRP at a later date in the amount of $656,000, provided the 
1997 MRP is approved by the Holding Company's stockholders. 

For additional information with respect to the use of the proceeds from the 
Resolicitation Offering, see ""Use of Proceeds"" in the Prospectus."
