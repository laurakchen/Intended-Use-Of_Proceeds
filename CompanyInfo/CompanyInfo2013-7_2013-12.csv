"AZURE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/azure-midstream-partners-lp-909732-72901,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/azure-midstream-partners-lp-909732-72901,424B4,7/29/2013,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=9417575,"We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $128.6 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and the structuring fee, but
before paying offering expenses, from the issuance and sale of common units
offered by this prospectus. We will use the net proceeds from this offering to:

.  pay offering expenses of approximately $2.5 million; and

.  repay approximately $126.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our
   existing credit facility and settle our related interest rate swap liability 
   of approximately $0.1 million.                                               

At the closing of this offering, we will enter into, and borrow $25.0 million
under, our new revolving credit facility. A portion of these borrowings will be
used to repay the remaining portion of our outstanding borrowings under our
existing credit facility. Immediately following the repayment of our outstanding
borrowings under our existing credit facility with the net proceeds of this
offering and a portion of the borrowings under our new revolving credit
facility, our existing credit facility will be terminated.

A portion of the amounts to be repaid under our existing credit facility with
the net proceeds of this offering and borrowings under our new revolving credit
facility were used to finance the development of our assets. As of July 18,
2013, we had approximately $131.9 million of indebtedness outstanding under our
existing credit facility. This indebtedness had a weighted average interest rate
of 3.95% as of July 18, 2013. Our existing credit facility matures in December
2014. As of July 18, 2013, we had liabilities of less than $0.1 million under
the interest rate swap related to our existing credit facility.

Our estimates are based on the initial public offering price of $20.00 per
common unit and assume no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional common units. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, we will use the net proceeds from that exercise to
redeem from NuDevco a number of common units equal to the number of common units
issued upon such exercise, at a price per common unit equal to the proceeds per
common unit in this offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting
discounts, commissions and the structuring fee.

The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform
services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business."

million if the underwriter exercises in full its over-allotment option to 
purchase up to 464,238 additional shares of our common stock), after deducting 
the underwriting discount, the fee payable in connection with the direct 
offering and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for 
investments in our technology and our sales and marketing functions, and for 
working capital and general corporate purposes, which may also include 
acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies. We expect 
that approximately $14.76 million of the net proceeds from this offering will be
available to us for these business purposes (or approximately $18.7 million if 
the underwriter exercises in full its over-allotment option to purchase 
additional shares). While we routinely engage in discussions with third parties 
regarding potential acquisitions in the ordinary course of our business, we do 
not have any current arrangements, definitive agreements or commitments with 
respect to any potential acquisitions, as of the date of this prospectus in 
which proceeds of the offering would be used.

On June 13, 2013, Mr. Schaeffer, one of our founders and a member of our Board 
of Directors, loaned us $250,000 to be payable in full on December 13, 2013. The
loan bears interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 4% per annum 
until the earlier of payment in full or December 13, 2013. We expect to use 
approximately $251,000 of the net proceeds of this offering to repay in full the
amount outstanding under this loan. The loan proceeds were used for working 
capital.

On July 1, 2013, Ferdinand Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company 
of which Mr. Ferdinand is the managing member, loaned us $250,000 to be payable 
in full on December 31, 2013. The loan bears interest on the unpaid principal 
balance at a rate of 4% per annum until the earlier of payment in full or 
December 31, 2013. We expect to use approximately $251,000 of the net proceeds 
of this offering to repay in full the amount outstanding under this loan. The 
loan proceeds were used for working capital.

On July 11, 2013, Thomas Ross, a member of our Board of Directors, loaned us 
$250,000 to be payable in full on January 10, 2014. The loan bears interest on 
the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 4% per annum until the earlier of 
payment in full or January 10, 2014. We expect to use approximately $250,400 of 
the net proceeds of this offering to repay in full the amount outstanding under 
this loan. The loan proceeds were used for working capital.

We intend to purchase 105,000 shares of our common stock from Mr. Storms, our 
CEO and Chairman of the Board, at a price of $8.415 per share in connection with
the consummation of this offering. Such purchase will be subject to, and 
conditioned upon, the completion of this offering. In connection with the 
closing of this offering, we expect to use $883,575 of the net proceeds of the 
offering to purchase these shares from Mr. Storms. The price per share to be 
paid by us in respect of these shares is equal to the public offering price per 
share to be received by us in this offering, less an amount equal to the 
underwriting discount payable per share to the underwriter in this offering.

In addition, pursuant to contractual obligations, we are required to make one 
time payments in an aggregate amount of approximately $1,021,000 to Messrs. 
Ferdinand, Schaeffer and Keller.

Except as otherwise set forth above, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering. 
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net 
proceeds from this offering. Furthermore, the amount and timing of our actual 
expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the cash used in or 
generated by our operations, the status of our business and product development,
the level of our sales and marketing activities and our investments and 
acquisitions.

Pending specific application of the net proceeds from this offering, we expect 
to invest the net proceeds from this offering primarily in short-term, interest 
bearing, investment grade securities, certificates of deposit or government 
securities."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including the acquisition and development of land and home
construction.

Our management will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds
from this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds

in this offering will be approximately $68.8 million, after deducting the

estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$79.6 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering costs payable by us.

We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering for the overall
development of our product candidates. We currently estimate that we will use
approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the
clinical development of rigosertib and approximately $5.0 million to fund the
development of our other clinical and preclinical programs. The balance will be
used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Pending the application
of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of
the offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.

Our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds to us
from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering. We
reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of certain
contingencies such as competitive developments, the results of our
commercialization efforts and investment opportunities and other factors."

million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares

after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital and to
create a public market for our common stock. As of the date of this prospectus,
we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds
of this offering. However, we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering
for funding our operations as follows: (1) approximately $18 million for
research and product development activities; (2) approximately $7 million for
sales and marketing activities, including expansion of our sales force to
support the ongoing commercialization of our products; (3) approximately $5
million for property, plant and equipment, including the build-out of our
laboratory in California, and intellectual property; and (4) the remaining
proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also
acquire or invest in complementary businesses or other assets; however, we
currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transaction.

Pending other uses, we intend to invest our proceeds in short-term investments
or hold them as cash. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield
a favorable return. Our management will have broad discretion in the use of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the net proceeds.

We do not intend to use proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness incurred
pursuant to the Credit Agreement."

we are offering will be approximately $59.0 million (or $68.2 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full), based
on the initial public offering price of $11.00 per share, and after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $22.5 million to fund our planned Phase 3 HCV-POLT trial 
  (currently designated a Phase 3 registration study in the European Union and 
  a Phase 2b study in the United States); 

. approximately $4.5 million to fund our planned Phase 2b CLF trial; 

. approximately $3.8 million to fund our planned Phase 2b ACLF trial; and 

. the remainder to fund the further clinical development of emricasan and for 
  working capital and general corporate purposes. 

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our
operations for at least the next 18 months after the date of this prospectus,
although there can be no assurance in that regard. In particular, we expect that
the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to complete our planned Phase
2b ACLF trial, Phase 3 HCV-POLT trial (currently designated a Phase 3
registration study in the European Union and a Phase 2b study in the United
States) and Phase 2b CLF trial. We will need to raise additional funds to
complete additional clinical trials of emricasan, to fund regulatory filings for
emricasan in the United States and the European Union and for potential
commercialization of emricasan.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and other development 
efforts for emricasan and other factors, as well as the amount of cash used in 
our operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds 
for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net 
proceeds from this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing 
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this   
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out 
    of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that 
    offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts 
    will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of
    approximately 3.6% to 3.8% (depending on the extent to which the            
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised) of the gross proceeds of  
    this offering. Upon completion of our initial business combination, up to   
    $10,750,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up
    to $13,225,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in   
    full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust     
    account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to  
    pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses    
    with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate 
    purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness        
    incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the   
    purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will  
    not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting        
    discounts and commissions.                                                  

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business       
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific        
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses  
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal     
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may   
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due       
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

Of the $307.5 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or approximately
$352.5 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
$300 million ($10.00 per unit), or approximately $345.0 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will
be deposited into a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and $7.5 million will be used to pay expenses in
connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following
this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in
U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $30,000
per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.01% per year. We will not be permitted
to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account, except
for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes, if any, and a one-time
release of amounts necessary to pay Delaware franchise taxes for 2013 on a
timely basis, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business
combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable
to complete a business combination within 21 months (or 24 months, as
applicable) from the closing of this offering (subject to the requirements of
law). Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that the interest earned
on the trust account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware
franchise taxes for 2013. Accordingly, after the payment of such franchise taxes
from amounts held in the trust account, the amount per public share held in the
trust account will be reduced to approximately $9.99 per share.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we 
may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general 
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the 
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on 
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund 
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay Mr. Graf, or an
entity owned and controlled by him, a monthly consulting fee of $15,000 plus, in
the event that Mr. Graf is no longer receiving medical insurance from an
employer, an additional amount per month to reimburse Mr. Graf for the purchase
of such insurance, for services prior to the completion of our initial business
combination, (regardless of the amount of services provided) including
preparation of our financial statements, SEC filings, financial due diligence of
targets for our initial business combination and negotiations of an agreement
for our initial business combination. We expect that Mr. Graf will devote a
majority of his monthly business time (at least 76 hours) on average to
providing us these services, although Mr. Graf will be entitled to receive the
full monthly consulting fee irrespective of the amount of services he provides
in a given month. We will reimburse our sponsor for office space, secretarial
and administrative services provided to members of our management team by our
sponsor, members of our sponsor, and members of our management team or their
affiliates, in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month in the event such space
and/or services are utilized and we do not pay a third party directly for such
services. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of October 1,
2013 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 21 months following the closing of this
offering (or 24 months from the closing of this offering if we have executed a
letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial
business combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering but have
not completed the initial business combination within such 21-month period),
subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations
(including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the
proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $96.3 million, based
on the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share, and after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $111.1 million. We will
also receive $12.75 million from the sale of 708,333 shares of common stock in
the concurrent private placement to an affiliate of Celgene at the public
offering price of $18.00 per share.

As of March 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of
$115.8 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement, together with our existing cash resources, as
follows:

. approximately $5 million to fund the costs of phase 1 clinical development
  of AG-221;                                                                

. if we exercise our option to develop and commercialize AG-120 in the United 
  States, approximately $20-25 million to fund IND-enabling costs and our share
  of early development costs for AG-120;                          

. approximately $20 million to fund the IND-enabling activities and phase 1/2 
  clinical development of AG-348;                                       

. approximately $20-25 million to fund research and development to advance  
  our pipeline of earlier-stage cancer metabolism and IEM programs; and     

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement of common stock represents our intentions based upon our current plans
and business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and
business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures
may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of
our development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
additional collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our
product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies,
medicines or technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may
use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the proceeds
in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments and U.S. government securities."

of the Class A common stock offered by us, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If
certain entities directly or indirectly controlled by Jonny Jones, our chairman
and chief executive officer, and/or his immediate family purchase 1,333,333
shares of Class A common stock at the public offering price in the offering and
Robert J. Brooks, our chief financial officer, purchases 30,000 shares of
Class A common stock at the public offering price in the offering, net proceeds
from the sale of Class A common stock would increase by approximately
$1.3 million due to the fact that the underwriters will receive no underwriting
commission or discount on the sale of these shares.

Jones Energy, Inc. will contribute the proceeds from this offering to JEH LLC in
exchange for JEH LLC Units. JEH LLC intends to use those net proceeds to repay
outstanding borrowings under its senior secured revolving credit facility
($445 million outstanding at June 30, 2013, excluding outstanding letters of
credit totaling $350,000). No material amounts of other funds will be used to
pay down any of JEH LLC's indebtedness. Our senior secured revolving credit
facility matures on November 5, 2017 and bears interest at a variable rate,
which was approximately 3.32% per annum as of December 31, 2012. Approximately
$130 million of the outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving
credit facility was incurred to fund a portion of the purchase price of the
Chalker acquisition. While we do not currently have any plans to borrow
additional amounts under our senior secured credit facility to repay other
borrowings, we may at any time reborrow amounts repaid thereunder.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our senior secured
revolving credit facility and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the net
proceeds of this offering.

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our
Class A common stock, we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of such shares
to repay additional borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit
facility."

US$396.0 million, or US$456.1 million if the underwriters exercise the
over-allotment option in full, after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for capital expenditures,
including potential investments and acquisitions, and other general corporate
purposes in our business segments, in order to take advantage of growth
opportunities that we foresee in our markets. We currently expect to use
approximately (i) 60% of the net proceeds for investments in our Infrastructure
segment, (ii) 10% of the net proceeds for the purchase of land in our Real
Estate segment, (iii) 20% of the net proceeds for acquisitions, and (iv) the
remainder for general corporate purposes. These estimates, however, are subject
to change.

We routinely evaluate new infrastructure concessions, acquisitions, land
purchases and other investment opportunities that are aligned with our strategic
goals. We cannot assure you that we will find opportunities that we consider to
be favorable to us, whether we will be able to take advantage of such
opportunities should they arise, or the timing of and funds required by such
opportunities. In addition, we expect to finance these opportunities with a
combination of cash on hand, net proceeds from this offering, new borrowings
and/or financial contributions from partners, depending on a variety of
commercial considerations at such time. Accordingly, we will have significant
flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering. As a result, our
actual use of proceeds from this offering could vary significantly from the
currently expected use.

Pending application of the net proceeds, we expect to invest the proceeds in
low-risk marketable securities, bank deposits, money market funds and similar
investments."

the underwriters’ overallotment option.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $8,350,000 to complete our Phase 2 clinical trials for HS-110
  against non-small lung cancer and the submission of related materials to the 
  FDA or an equivalent amount as grant matching funds to fund an expanded 
  clinical trial. We plan to initiate a 125 patient Phase 2 trial on patients 
  with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Our Phase 2 study has been designed
  as a maintenance therapy study in patients with Stage III/IV NSCLC who have
  completed a 1st line regimen consisting of a platinum doublet, crizotinib or
  erlotinib and achieved at least stable disease. We plan to use up to 
  approximately $8.35 million from the net proceeds of this offering to finance 
  this trial. We have applied for grant funding to enable us to expand the size
  and scope of this clinical trial and if the grant funding is received, will 
  use up the $8.35 million of the net proceeds from this offering as “matching
  funds” as required by the granting organization to expand the size and scope
  of our trial. There can be no assurance that the grant funding will be 
  received. If sufficient grant funding is not received by the commencement of
  the trial to fund the trial, we will use the net proceeds of this offering to 
  provide the needed funding for a 125 patient Phase 2 trial;

. approximately $1,000,000 for initiation and completion of Phase 1/2 clinical
  trials of HS-410 against bladder cancer. We plan to file an IND for use of
  HS-410 to prevent the recurrence of bladder cancer. This initial IND will
  include a 93 patient, Phase 1/2 trial to examine safety, tolerability, immune
  response and preliminary clinical activity of HS-410 in patients with high
  risk, superficial bladder cancer who have completed surgical resection and 6 
  weekly intravesical bacillus Calmet-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy installations.
  We plan to use approximately $1 million from the net proceeds of this offering
  to enhance the scope of this trial as currently designed and funded;

. approximately $100,000 to enhance the scope of and pay regulatory fees for our
  HS-110 lung cancer investigator-sponsored trial to test the use of HS-110 as a
  combination therapy against lung cancer. Our HS-110 lung cancer trial is an
  investigator-sponsored trial to test the use of HS-110 as a combination 
  therapy against lung cancer. While the trial is fully-funded by the Marcus 
  Foundation, we plan to use approximately $100,000 to enhance the scope of this
  trial and prepare appropriate regulatory filings;

. approximately $1,500,000 to fund one to two additional Phase 1 clinical trials
  on additional cancer indications. We are creating and have created 
  ImPACT-based drugs against additional cancers and plan to use approximately 
  $1.5 million from the net proceeds of this offering to fund one to two 
  additional Phase 1 clinical trials on additional cancer indications;

. $300,000 to repay the portion of the loan from Square 1 Bank that is due and
  payable in the next eighteen months. We plan to use approximately $300,000 of
  the net proceeds of this offering to repay the portion of the loans from 
  Square 1 Bank that is due and payable in the next eighteen months. One loan 
  from Square 1 Bank is payable on September 7, 2013 in 36 monthly installments
  of principal and interest and accrues interest monthly at an interest rate of
  3% plus prime or 6% per annum whichever is greater. The other loan is payable
  on August 7, 2013 and August 7, 2014 for 5% of the outstanding principal and 
  accrued interest each and then the remaining principal and accrued interest is
  due December 14, 2014 and accrues interest at 4.25%. Finally, the last loan is
  payable as interest only until January 9, 2014 when the entire principal 
  balance is due and it accrues interest monthly at an annual rate of 0.75% plus
  prime or 4% per annum, whichever is greater. As of May 21, 2013, we had 
  outstanding $725,000 under the Square 1 Bank loans; and

. the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
  including ongoing operations, vendor payables and expansion of the business,
  further research and development, potential regulatory submissions and hiring
  additional sales and marketing personnel to support increased sales and
  marketing activities.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based on our present plans and business conditions. As of the date of
this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for
the net proceeds to be received from this offering. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors including the progress
in, and costs of, our clinical trials and other preclinical development programs
and the amount of funding, if any, received from grants. Accordingly, our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds,
and investors will be relying on the judgment of management regarding the
application of the net proceeds from the offering. We may find it necessary or
advisable to reallocate the net proceeds of this offering; however any such
reallocation would be substantially limited to the categories set forth above as
we do not intend to use the net proceeds for other purposes. Pending such uses
set forth above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in government securities and
other short-term investment grade, marketable securities."

discounts, structuring fees and estimated offering expenses. Our estimate
assumes the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units from us is
not exercised. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general
partnership purposes, including to fund potential future acquisitions from
Phillips 66 and third parties and potential future expansion capital
expenditures.

We expect to use the majority of the retained net proceeds from this offering
for potential future acquisitions, such as the potential acquisition from
Phillips 66 of our right of first offer assets. However, the consummation and
timing of any future acquisition of our right of first offer assets are subject
to various contingencies, including Phillips 66’s willingness to offer such
assets for sale and its willingness to accept any offer we may choose to make.
We may also consider the acquisition of other assets from Phillips 66 and third 
parties. Any such acquisitions, however, will also depend on various 
contingencies, including our ability to identify attractive acquisition 
candidates and successfully negotiate acceptable purchase agreements.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the
remainder of the 2,463,750 additional common units, if any, will be issued to
Phillips 66. Any such common units issued to Phillips 66 will be issued for no
additional consideration. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase additional common units from us, we expect to receive net proceeds of
approximately $404.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
structuring fees and estimated offering expenses. We will use any net proceeds

units from us for general partnership purposes."

   interest at a weighted average rate of 5.3% per annum. The $46.3 million
   loan is scheduled to mature on May 31, 2014;                            

.  approximately $40.0 million (including principal and related accrued

   interest at a fixed rate of 6% and is scheduled to mature on October 1, 2013;

.  approximately $74.4 million (including principal and related accrued    
   interest) to repay both tranches of a loan to Fund III that are secured by 
   certain of the properties we will acquire in our formation transactions. 
   These tranches bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.6% and 12.0% per annum. 
   Both tranches of this loan are scheduled to mature on August 31, 2014;

.  approximately $64.5 million (including principal and related accrued    
   interest) to repay a loan to Fund IV that is secured by certain of the  
   properties we will acquire in our formation transactions, which bears   
   interest at a fixed rate of 6% and is scheduled to mature on October 1, 2013;

   general corporate purposes.

Prior to the full deployment of the net proceeds as described above, we intend
to invest the undeployed net proceeds in interest-bearing short-term investment
grade securities or money-market accounts that are consistent with our intention
to qualify as a REIT, including, for example, government and government agency
certificates, certificates of deposit and interest-bearing bank deposits. We
expect that these initial investments will provide a lower net return than we
expect to receive from investments in industrial properties.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we expect to
use the additional approximately $31.2 million of net proceeds for general
corporate purposes, including acquisitions of real estate assets.

The debt repayment described above is an estimate based on principal and related
accrued interest outstanding as of March 31, 2013. The actual amounts of the
debt repayments will depend on the principal and related accrued interest
outstanding at the time of payment and may be greater than or less than our
estimates above."

$85.5 million, based on the initial public offering price of $21.00 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares, there will be no change in total proceeds to us, as any
additional shares would be sold by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use approximately $52.5 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to pay unpaid dividends accumulated through the closing of this
offering on our outstanding shares of preferred stock, as follows:

. $5.7 million in dividends will be paid on our outstanding shares of Series
  B-1 preferred stock, which have accumulated at a rate of 8.0% per annum of
  the original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of which the 
  amount payable in cash as of March 31, 2013 is $5.0 million;          

. $25.3 million in dividends will be paid on our outstanding shares of Series 
  B-2 preferred stock, which have accumulated at a rate of 8.0% per annum of the
  original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of which the 
  amount payable in cash as of March 31, 2013 is $22.2 million;

. $6.9 million in dividends will be paid on our outstanding shares of Series

  the original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of which the 
  amount payable in cash as of March 31, 2013 is $5.7 million;          

. $13.9 million in dividends will be paid on our outstanding shares of Series 
  BB-3 preferred stock, which have accumulated at a rate of 8.0% per annum of 
  the original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of which the 
  amount payable in cash as of March 31, 2013 is $11.4 million;

. $0.6 million in dividends will be paid on our outstanding shares of Series
  B-4 preferred stock, which have accumulated at a rate of 4.0% per annum of
  the original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of which the 
  amount payable in cash as of March 31, 2013 is $0.5 million; and

  B-5 preferred stock, which have accumulated at a rate of 4.0% per annum of
  the original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of which the 
  amount payable in cash as of March 31, 2013 is $0.1 million.          

As a result of the anticipated payment of accumulated and unpaid dividends on
our outstanding shares of preferred stock, certain of our executive officers,
directors, beneficial owners of 5.0% or more of our outstanding shares of common
stock and affiliated entities who are holders of our preferred stock will
receive approximately $50.3 million of the net proceeds received by us from this
offering. In addition, we intend to use approximately $6.6 million of the net
proceeds to repay principal and accrued but unpaid interest under six promissory
notes held by the former owners of eConversions Limited, which notes accrue
interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum and have a maturity date of August 17,
2013.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Series 1 common
stock by the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders who are our
executive officers, members of our board of directors, beneficial owners of 5.0%
or more of our outstanding shares of common stock and affiliated entities, will
receive approximately $79.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares in
this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions payable by
such selling stockholders.

We do not have current specific plans for the use of a significant portion of
the net proceeds from this offering. We generally intend to use the balance of
the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and other general
corporate purposes, including to develop new technologies, fund capital
expenditures or make investments in or acquisitions of other businesses,
solutions or technologies.

Pending the uses mentioned above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds to
us from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the proceeds."

cash proceeds to be received by us and the selling stockholder in this offering)
to purchase Senior Secured Notes from holders who accept our offer to repurchase
Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 112% of the principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If our net proceeds
from this offering are insufficient to fund any such purchase and all of the
other purposes set forth above, we will use other available cash resources,
potentially including borrowings under the new Revolving Credit Facility, to
make up for any shortfall.

We intend to use any remaining net proceeds to us from this offering for working
capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption
of a portion of our Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding after
completion of the repurchase offer described above. If the opportunity arises,
we may use a portion of any remaining net proceeds to us from this offering to
expand into new geographic markets or enter into strategic transactions in a
manner consistent with our acquisition strategy and capital-efficient business
model.

Repayment of PMR Acquisition Loan

To fund the PMR Acquisition, DPM Acquisition, LLC, one of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, entered into the PMR Acquisition Loan with Guggenheim Corporate
Funding, LLC, as administrative agent for the lenders, which include affiliates
of, or funds or accounts managed or advised by, Guggenheim Partners Investment
Management, LLC, which is an affiliate of the Guggenheim Investor, Wellington
Management Company, LLP, including some of the Wellington Management Investors,
and Silver Rock Financial LLC, which is an affiliate of the Silver Rock
Investors. The PMR Acquisition Loan is collateralized by substantially all of
the assets of DPM Acquisition, LLC. The PMR Acquisition Loan was initially in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount of $71.3 million (consisting of a $61.3
million term loan and a $10.0 million revolving loan). The PMR Acquisition Loan
bears interest at a rate of 18.0% per annum (of which an amount equal to not
less than 10.0% per annum is paid in cash on a quarterly basis and the remaining
accrued amount may be paid, at our election, in cash or in kind by adding the
applicable accrued amount to principal), and matures on May 21, 2016. On
September 28, 2012, we terminated the revolving loan and transferred the
then-outstanding balance under the revolving loan to the term loan. We intend to
use approximately $56.0 million of the net proceeds to us from this offering to
repay an equivalent amount of the $58.3 million outstanding principal amount
under the PMR Acquisition Loan.

Payment of Purchase Price in PMR Service Companies Acquisition

On June 12, 2013, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with each of the
PMR Service Companies and the owner of such entities, pursuant to which we have
agreed to purchase, upon the closing of this offering and subject to other
customary closing conditions, resort management agreements, accounting services
agreements, billing and collection services agreements and other assets of the
PMR Service Companies. The purchase price for the PMR Service Companies
Acquisition is based upon, among other things, the initial public offering price
of this offering and will be paid entirely in cash. At the initial public
offering price of $14.00 per share, we will pay to the PMR Service Companies, at
the closing of the PMR Service Companies Acquisition, an aggregate cash purchase
price of $47.8 million. 

Repayment of Tempus Acquisition Loan

To fund the Tempus Resorts Acquisition, Tempus Acquisition, LLC, one of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into the Tempus Acquisition Loan with
Guggenheim Corporate Funding, LLC, as administrative agent for the lenders,
which include affiliates of, or funds or accounts managed or advised by,
Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, LLC, which is an affiliate of the
Guggenheim Investor, and Silver Rock Financial LLC, which is an affiliate of the
Silver Rock Investors. The Tempus Acquisition Loan is collateralized by all
assets of Tempus Acquisition, LLC. The Tempus Acquisition Loan was initially in
an aggregate principal amount of $41.1 million (consisting of $35.6 million in
two term loans and a $5.5 million revolving loan). The Tempus Acquisition Loan
bears interest at a rate of 18.0% per annum (of which an amount equal to not
less than 10.0% per annum is paid in cash on a quarterly basis and the remaining
accrued amount may be paid, at our election, in cash or in kind by adding the
applicable accrued amount to principal), and matures on June 30, 2015. On
September 28, 2012, we terminated the revolving loan and transferred the
then-outstanding balance under the revolving loan to the term loans. On
October 4, 2012, we further amended the Tempus Acquisition Loan to provide an
additional $6.6 million of borrowings under the term loans to fund the Aegean
Blue Acquisition. The Tempus Acquisition Loan was further amended on
November 20, 2012 and December 21, 2012 to increase the term loans by
$2.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively. Some of the Wellington Management
Investors became lenders under this credit facility in connection with a
December 2012 amendment to the Tempus Acquisition Loan. We are required to pay
an exit fee of $2.7 million in connection with the repayment of the Tempus
Acquisition Loan as contemplated in this offering. We intend to use
approximately $50.0 million of the net proceeds to us from this offering to
repay the outstanding principal amount, accrued and unpaid interest and exit
fees under the Tempus Acquisition Loan.

Repurchase of Warrants to Purchase Shares of Diamond Resorts Corporation Common
Stock

An affiliate of Guggenheim Partners, LLC holds warrants to purchase an aggregate
of 0.394% of the outstanding common stock of Diamond Resorts Corporation, and
another institutional investor holds warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1.045%
of the outstanding common stock of Diamond Resorts Corporation, in each case at
a nominal exercise price. We intend to use approximately $10.3 million of the
net proceeds to us from this offering to repurchase these warrants.

Repurchase and Redemption of Senior Secured Notes

The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum and will
mature on August 15, 2018. We are required, within 30 days of the closing of
this offering, to make an offer to each holder of Senior Secured Notes to
purchase a portion of our Senior Secured Notes as described below at a price
equal to 112% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the date of purchase. The Notes Indenture requires us to offer to repurchase
the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes that may be purchased on
the terms described above with 25% of the net cash proceeds to be received by us
and the selling stockholder in this offering. As of the date of this prospectus,
we cannot determine the extent to which (if at all) holders of Senior Secured
Notes will accept our repurchase offer.

The Notes Indenture also provides that at any time on or prior to August 15,
2013, we may redeem up to an aggregate of 35% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 112% of the principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of redemption, with the net cash proceeds we receive in this offering,
provided that at least 65% in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes originally issued remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of
such redemption and (ii) such redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of
the closing of this offering. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not
made any determination as to whether or not we will exercise this right of
redemption.

Remaining Net Proceeds

Depending upon the extent to which holders of Senior Secured Notes accept our
offer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes and the purchase price that we are
required to pay in the PMR Service Companies Acquisition, in each case as
described above, we may have up to approximately $14.2 million in remaining net
proceeds to us from this offering, after giving effect to the other uses of
proceeds described above (assuming (1) no holders of the Senior Secured Notes
accept our offer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes, and (2) that we do not use
any net proceeds to us from this offering to redeem any Senior Secured Notes).
We intend to use any remaining net proceeds to us from this offering for working
capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of
some or all of the remaining outstanding principal amount, accrued and unpaid
interest and exit fees under the PMR Acquisition Loan and/or the redemption of a
portion of our Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding after completion of
the repurchase offer described above.

We cannot, however, specify with certainty the particular uses for the remaining
net proceeds we will have upon completion of this offering and, at the date
hereof, cannot accurately predict the amounts that we may spend for any
particular purpose. Our management team will have broad discretion in
determining the uses of such portion of the net proceeds to us of this offering.
The amounts of our actual expenditures will be influenced by a variety of
factors, including the timing and extent of our expansion opportunities, the
amount of cash used by our operations and the occurrence of unforeseen
opportunities and events. Pending the use of those funds, we intend to invest
them in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, exclusive of the net 
proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional 
shares of Class A common stock, to purchase a number of newly-issued UCP, LLC 
Series B Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock sold in 
this offering, at a purchase price per unit equal to the initial public 
offering price per share of Class A common stock less the underwriting discount

purposes, such as the acquisition of land, and for land development, home 
construction and other related purposes. If the underwriters exercise their 
option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, UCP, Inc. will use
the net proceeds from such exercise to purchase a portion of PICO’s UCP, LLC 
Series A Units at a price per UCP, LLC Series A unit equal to the net proceeds 
received by us per Class A common stock sold in this offering. If necessary, we 
will reduce the portion of the net proceeds received from any exercise of the 
underwriters’ option that we use to purchase a portion of PICO’s UCP, LLC Series
A Units so that, after giving effect to such purchase, we will remain a 
“controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of
the NYSE. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering 
in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term, 
interest-bearing investment grade securities, money market accounts, 
certificates of deposit and direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government. 

Though we will receive the net proceeds from any sale of shares of our Class 
A common stock pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares of our Class A common stock, we will use such proceeds to purchase a 
portion of PICO’s UCP, LLC Series A Units; accordingly, any such proceeds 
will not be available to us to acquire or develop land, construct homes or 
otherwise invest in our business. To the extent we reduce the portion of any 
such proceeds used to purchase UCP, LLC Series A Units from PICO, such amounts 
will be available to us for investment in our business."

stock in this offering will be approximately $72.0 million after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
shares of common stock, we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately
$83.4 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $18.0 to $25.0 million for clinical expenditures to advance  
  demcizumab (OMP-21M18) through Phase II clinical trials;                   

. approximately $18.0 to $25.0 million for clinical and manufacturing
  expenditures to advance a bispecific antibody through Phase II clinical
  trials;                                                                    

. approximately $10.0 million for clinical and manufacturing expenditures to

  trials;                                                                    

. approximately $5.0 million to fund our research and drug discovery activities
  related to additional product candidates; and                   

. any remaining proceeds for working capital and general corporate expenditures.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process,
it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds
from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. Additionally, we may
use a portion of the proceeds for our collaborations with GSK and Bayer,
although we currently plan to use our current cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investment balances, along with future program payments from GSK and
Bayer, to progress those collaborations. Our management will have sole and broad
discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering, as well as
future cash payments received (if any) from our collaborations with GSK and
Bayer. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors including the results of our research and development efforts, the

to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing investment-grade
securities or government securities."

proceeds from the sale of the Class A common stock offered hereby based upon 
the assumed initial public offering price of $22.00 per share, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions but before offering expenses (all of 
which will be paid by NRG). If the underwriters exercise in full their option 
to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, we estimate that the 
proceeds to us will be approximately $468.0 million, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions.  

We intend to use approximately $72.8 million of the proceeds from this offering 
to acquire newly issued Yield LLC Class A units, representing 5.4% of Yield

from our sale of common stock in this offering, or approximately $41.2 million
if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, after deducting
the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to fund
our single, open-label, 13,200 subject Phase 3 trial of REG1, or the REGULATE-
PCI trial, and to support our operations, to create a public market for our 
common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. 
We currently intend to use approximately $31.3 million of the net proceeds from 
this offering for the REGULATE-PCI trial and the balance to fund working capital
and to support our operations.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including:

.  the timing of the REGULATE-PCI trial;

.  any delays in the achievement of the interim milestones for the REGULATE-PCI 
   trial;

.  the extent to which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may require us to
   perform additional clinical trials for REG1;                               

.  the scope, progress, results and costs of development for additional       
   indications for REG1 and for our other product candidates;                 

.  the extent to which we establish collaboration, co-promotion, distribution 
   and other similar agreements for REG1 or our other product candidates;     

.  the extent to which we acquire or invest in products, businesses and       
   technologies;                                                              

.  the costs of obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual  
   property claims; and                                                       

.  any unforeseen or underestimated cash needs.

Therefore, as of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty
all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the
completion of this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering.

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient for us to
fund the REGULATE-PCI trial through the first interim analysis, which we expect
will occur by the beginning of the second quarter of 2014 and to fund our
operations through the end of the second quarter of 2014. It is possible that we
will not achieve the progress that we expect with respect to REG1 because the
actual costs and timing of conducting a large Phase 3 clinical trial are
difficult to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays. Upon the
consummation of this offering, we will have no committed external sources of
funds. The expected net proceeds of this offering will not be sufficient for us
to complete the REGULATE-PCI trial and we will need to raise substantial
additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of REG1. We
also will need to raise additional capital in the future to complete the
development and commercialization of REG1 for additional indications and for our
other product candidates. As a result, we will need to finance our future cash
needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate
collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

approximately $66.0 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full) from the sale of the common shares in this offering, after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a U.S. public market for our common shares and
to facilitate our future access to the U.S. public equity markets. We intend to
use approximately $28.5 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund
the first planned Phase 3 clinical trial of PRX302 and approximately $10.5
million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund other ongoing clinical
development of PRX302. We intend to use approximately $10.3 million of the net
proceeds from this offering to make monthly principal and interest payments on
our term loan with Oxford Finance LLC through 2014, in accordance with the terms
of the Loan and Security Agreement dated July 15, 2011, as amended. The interest
rate on the term loan, which is scheduled to mature on November 1, 2014, is
9.5%. We will use any remaining proceeds from this offering for general
corporate purposes. We will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds
from this offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our
results of operations or enhance the value of our stock. Pending their use, we
plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government.

We believe the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, together
with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our operations through 2015,
including through receipt of topline data from our first planned Phase 3
clinical trial."

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the common shares to be sold by the
selling shareholders in this offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for general
corporate purposes, including the costs associated with being a public company,
which we estimate will result in additional costs of approximately $2.5 to
$3.0 million per annum. We presently intend to contribute substantially all the
remaining net proceeds of this offering to our subsidiary Third Point Re’s
surplus to increase its underwriting capacity in order to support the growth of
our reinsurance premium writings. To the extent that this additional surplus is
not immediately needed to pay claims or expenses, it will be invested consistent
with past practice pursuant to the terms of our investment management agreement
with Third Point LLC. The terms of the agreement among members entered into with
our existing shareholders requires that we effect an initial public offering
within a contractually specified time period. We are conducting this offering
both to raise capital to support the growth of our reinsurance business and to
provide a liquidity realization event to our existing shareholders who elect to
participate as selling shareholders in this offering. All of our existing
shareholders have the contractual right to request the inclusion of shares to be
sold on their behalf in this offering pursuant to a registration rights
agreement."

Increase in registered capital of Wujiang Luxiang and corresponding                    
lending and guarantee capacity                                          $ 6,692,600 (1 )

(1) We intend to use all of the net proceeds of this offering not otherwise
    designated in this table to increase registered capital of Wujiang Luxiang
    and its lending capacity. Our lending and guaranteeing capacity will be   
    increased when the registered capital is increased. In addition, we believe
    that increased registered capital will increase our ability to borrow funds
    from third-party banks, which in turn will further increase our lending and
    guarantee capacity,
                                                              
(2) We intend to use $500,000 of the net proceeds of this offering for general
    corporate purposes, such as general and administrative expenses, capital 
    expenditures, working capital and the potential acquisition of similar 
    lending companies in the Jiangsu province of the PRC if good opportunities
    present themselves. To date we have not entered into any binding 
    arrangements to acquire any other entities nor is there any arrangement or
    understanding to acquire other microcredit companies, and we may never     
    enter into any such agreements. If acquisitions do not occur, we may use a
    portion of the balance to further increase our registered capital.
                                                              
(3) We intend to have a reserve of $550,000 consisting of $350,000 of cash and
    $200,000 of common stock to be used to engage investor relations 
    professionals to assist in shareholder communications.

Immediately upon closing of the offering, CCC will transfer $6,692,600 of the
net proceeds received by CCC in this offering to a Hong Kong bank account of CCC
HK. CCC HK shall then permit such funds (USD) to be used by the Wujiang
Shareholders, as collateral, to obtain a domestic loan (RMB) in an amount equal
to approximately $6,692,600. The proceeds from the domestic loan will be
contributed in their entirety to Wujiang Luxiang for the purpose of increasing
its registered capital. The domestic lender will deposit the funds being lent to
the Wujiang Shareholders into an escrow account designated or approved by CCC
HK, from which the funds will be released to an account of Wujiang Luxiang,
only upon CCC HK’s written instructions, and the loan will be satisfied by the
collateral. Wujiang Shareholders shall pay an interest equal to the PBOC
benchmark interest rate to the domestic lender and such domestic loan shall have
a three-month term. However, the actual amount of interest that will be due will
most likely be minimal since the intent is to have the loan satisfied by the
collateral as soon as possible after the loan is made.

In connection with the above loan, the domestic lender and the Wujiang
Shareholders will be required to make certain filings with SAFE. In the event
the necessary SAFE approvals are not received within 90 days of the closing of
this offering (or such shorter period of time as determined by the Company), or
the Wujiang Shareholders and the domestic lender do not consummate the loan, the
Wujiang Shareholders will be unable to make the contributions to increase the
registered capital of Wujiang Luxiang. Should this occur, then, in the interim,
the proceeds of this offering will be loaned by Wujiang Luxiang from CCC HK's
offshore account to either Wujiang Luxiang’s current clients who have offshore
operations or such client’s offshore vendors. The Company shall stop making
these interim loans once the proceeds are made available to the Wujiang
Shareholders to be used to increase the registered capital of Wujiang Luxiang.
These loans made during this interim period shall follow the same loan
application, review and approval process and the same risk management process as
applied in our current direct loan business. Once SAFE approvals are received,
the above-referenced domestic loan will be consummated and the proceeds will be
contributed to Wujiang Luxiang as registered capital. Should SAFE approval be
for less than the full amount requested, the proceeds will continue to be
deployed as described above, until SAFE approval is obtained. The above 
description shall be defined as the “Funding.” 

 
The amount that we actually expend will depend on a number of factors, including
our development, activities, as well as the amount of cash generated or used by
our operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use a portion of the
net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds.

The Underwriter has a 45-day option to purchase up to 205,500 additional shares
of our common stock at the public offering price solely to cover
over-allotments, if any. Any proceeds received from the over-allotment will be
used to increase registered capital of Wujiang Luxiang following the same
procedure outlined above."

of 20,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, based on an initial
public offering price of $21.00 per common unit, after deducting underwriting
discounts and estimated offering expenses. We intend to use these proceeds as
follows:

. make a cash distribution to QEP of $272.2 million, a portion of which will 
  be used to reimburse QEP for certain capital expenditures it incurred with 
  respect to assets contributed to us;

  repay all $114.0 million of its outstanding debt;                          

. pay revolving credit facility origination fees of $3.5 million; and

. pay Wells Fargo Securities, LLC a structuring fee of $2.1 million.

As of March 31, 2013, QEP Operating, our wholly owned subsidiary, had
approximately $114.0 million of debt outstanding, comprised of intercompany
loans from QEP that bear interest at 6.05% and are due March 31, 2014 and 2017,
respectively. QEP Operating assumed this intercompany debt in connection with
this offering. The outstanding indebtedness was incurred to primarily fund
capital expenditures.

The net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to
purchase additional common units will be used to redeem from QEP a number of
common units equal to the number of common units issued upon exercise of the
option at a price per common unit equal to the net proceeds per common unit in
this offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts and the
structuring fee. Accordingly, any exercise of the underwriters’ option will not
affect the total number of units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay
the minimum quarterly distribution on all units.

services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business."

(4)These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
   these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we  
   may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
   connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon
   the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we        
   identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific    
   regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due      
   diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our      
   staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of           
   consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not      
   anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
   fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
   fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
   category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount of 
   interest available to us from the trust account may be less than expected as 
   a result of the current interest rate environment. Based on the current      
   interest rate environment, we would expect approximately $30,000 (after      
   payment of taxes owed on such interest income) to be available to us from    
   interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over 16 months        
   following the closing of this offering; however, we can provide no assurances
   regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per   
   annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may 
   be invested.                                                                 

A total of approximately $155.25 million (or approximately $177.075 million if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the aggregate
net proceeds from this offering and all of the private placement, including
approximately $4.5 million (or approximately $5.175 million if the underwriters’
overallotment option is exercised in full) of the deferred underwriting
discount, will be placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in United States
government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds investing solely in United States Treasuries and meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for any
interest income released to us for working capital purposes or the payment of
taxes or dissolution expenses, none of the funds held in the trust account will
be released, subject to the requirements of law, until the earlier of (i) the
consummation of our initial business combination; (ii) the expiration or
termination of any tender offer conducted by us in connection with a proposed
business combination not otherwise withdrawn; (iii) the redemption of our public
shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 16 months
from the consummation of this offering (or up to 24 months in case of
extensions), subject to applicable law; or (iv) otherwise upon our liquidation
or in the event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account
and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the 
expiration of the 16 month (or extended) period (our board of directors may
determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it 
determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the 
remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or satisfy 
regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business 
combination).

We may increase the initial amount held in the trust account from approximately
$10.35 per public share prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement
of which this prospectus forms a part. In such case, we expect that the increase
would be funded by an increase in the amount of the deferral by the underwriters
of the underwriting discount payable in connection with this offering, an
increase in the number of placement units to be purchased by our sponsor at
$10.00 per unit and/or a reduction from $1,100,000 of the amount initially
available to us for working capital that is not held in the trust account.
Public stockholders would own a smaller percentage of our outstanding common
stock on a fully diluted basis to the extent that our sponsor purchases
additional placement units. We do not intend to reduce the initial amount to be
held in the trust account.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination, we
may apply the cash released from the trust account that is not applied to the
purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust plus interest income on the amount in
the trust account that may be released to fund working capital requirements will
be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are
allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary
due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest,
we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of
the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a
letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a
business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking
in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us. To the extent that the underwriters exercise their
overallotment option, the interest income we may withdraw from the trust account
will proportionately increase. In addition, if the size of this offering is
increased or decreased, it would result in a proportionate increase or decrease
in the amount of interest earned in the trust account. We will use any such
increase in interest income to cover our working capital expenses. While we
currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and while
they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, we
believe that any additional interest income earned and released to us would
facilitate our ability to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater
number of potential acquisition targets.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq, we have
agreed to pay Quinpario Partners LLC, an affiliate of our sponsor a total of
$10,000 per month for office space, administrative services and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Quinpario Partners LLC for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Quinpario Partners LLC compensation in
lieu of salary or other remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon
consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will
cease paying these monthly fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, an affiliate of our sponsor, Quinpario
Partners LLC, has loaned to us a total of $232,139 to be used for a portion of
the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured
and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2013 or the consummation of this
offering. The loan will be repaid upon the consummation of this offering out of
the proceeds of this offering. We may draw down up to a total of $250,000 in
connection with expenses related to this offering on the same terms.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital
held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from
our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $750,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, we may enter into privately negotiated transactions to
purchase public shares from stockholders following consummation of the initial
business combination with proceeds released to us from the trust account
immediately following consummation of the initial business combination. Our
initial stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates may also purchase
shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the
consummation of our initial business combination. Neither we nor our initial
stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will make any
such purchases when we or they are in possession of any material non-public
information not disclosed to the seller. Although we do not currently anticipate
paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, in the event we do,
the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of those stockholders
not receiving any such additional consideration. In addition, the payment of a
premium by us after the consummation of our initial business combination may not
be in the best interest of the remaining stockholders who do not redeem their
shares. Such stockholders will experience a reduction in book value per share
compared to the value received by stockholders that have their shares purchased
by us at a premium. Except for the limitations described above on use of trust
proceeds released to us prior to consummating our initial business combination,
there is no limit on the number of shares that could be acquired by us or our
affiliates, or the price we or they may pay, if we hold a stockholder vote.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the expiration or termination of any tender offer conducted by
us in connection with a proposed business combination not otherwise withdrawn;
(iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a
business combination within 16 months from the consummation of this offering (or
up to 24 months in case of extensions), subject to applicable law; or (iv)
otherwise upon our liquidation or in the event our board of directors resolves
to liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a
business combination prior to the expiration of the 16 month (or extended)
period (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account
prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment, that it is
improbable within the remaining time to identify an attractive business
combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to
consummate a business combination). In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders and initial holder have agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to its founder shares and placement shares (i) in
connection with the consummation of a business combination, (ii) if we fail to
consummate our initial business combination within 16 months from the
consummation of this offering (or up to 24 months in case of extensions), (iii)
in connection with an expired or unwithdrawn tender offer, and (iv) upon our
liquidation prior to the expiration of the 16 month (or extended) period.
However, if our initial stockholders or any of our officers, directors or
affiliates acquires public shares, they will be entitled to redemption rights
with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business
combination within the required time period.

Our initial stockholders, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant
to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 16 months from the consummation
of this offering (or up to 24 months in case of extensions), unless we provide
our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common
stock upon approval of any such amendment as described herein.

If we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business
combination within 16 months, we may extend the period of time to consummate a
business combination twice, each by an additional four months, for an aggregate
of eight additional months. In order to extend the time available for us to
consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor, or its affiliates or
designees, would deposit an aggregate of $1.125 million (or approximately $0.075
per public share, or $0.065 per public share if the overallotment is exercised
in full) for each four month extension into the trust account prior to the
applicable deadline. In return, they would receive 112,500 extension units
($10.00 per unit), on the same terms as in the private placement that will occur
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. An aggregate of 225,000
extension units could be issued in connection with the two extensions. Neither
our sponsor, nor any of its affiliates or designees, is obligated to purchase
such units in order to allow us to extend the time for us to complete our
initial business combination."

of our common stock by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds to the Company from this offering to pay
approximately $46.2 million of the outstanding balances under our Revolver and
to pay a fee of $9.0 million to Gores to terminate our management services
agreement with Gores.

Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest, at our option, at either a base
rate (which means the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the
prime rate) plus a base rate margin (which ranges from 0.50% to 1.00% based on
Revolver availability) or LIBOR plus a LIBOR rate margin (which ranges from
1.50% to 2.00% based on Revolver availability). The Revolver matures in December
2016. An affiliate of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC is a lender under our
Revolver. Accordingly, the affiliate will receive net proceeds from this

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets,
as well as to obtain additional capital. We intend to use the net proceeds from
this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including
further expansion of our operations and product development.

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
acquire, invest in or license complementary products, technologies or
businesses, but we currently have no plans, proposals or arrangements with
respect to any potential acquisition, investment or in-license. We may allocate
funds from other sources to fund some or all of these activities.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering.

The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,

of 3,871,750 common units offered by us in this offering, after deducting
underwriting discounts, structuring fee and estimated offering expenses. The net
proceeds to us reflect that we are paying the estimated offering expenses
attributable to all the common units that we and the selling unitholder are
selling to the public. We intend to use these proceeds as follows:

.  pay transaction expenses related to our new revolving credit facility in the 
   amount of approximately $1.6 million;

.  distribute to the selling unitholder approximately $29.9 million, the 
   majority of which is to reimburse the selling unitholder for costs related 
   to the acquisition or improvement of assets that the selling unitholder will 
   contribute to us;

.  repay indebtedness owed to a commercial bank under a term loan of 
   approximately $8.1 million;

.  repay indebtedness owed to a related party of approximately $14.1 million;

.  repay existing payables of approximately $4.3 million; and

.  provide us working capital of approximately $12.0 million.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common units by the selling
unitholder in this offering.

Immediately following the repayment of the outstanding balance of our existing
indebtedness with the net proceeds of this offering, we will enter into a new
revolving credit facility. We do not expect to borrow under the revolving credit
facility or to have any other debt at the closing of this offering.

As of May 31, 2013, we had approximately $8.1 million of debt outstanding under
our existing term loan. Borrowings under our existing term loan bear interest at
0.77% over the one-month LIBOR rate and are due on October 8, 2013. Our
outstanding indebtedness was incurred primarily to provide funds for
acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

The net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to
purchase additional common units will be used to redeem from our parent a number
of common units equal to the number of common units issued upon exercise of the
option at a price per common unit equal to the net proceeds per common unit in
this offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts and the
structuring fee. Accordingly, any exercise of the underwriters’ option will not
affect the total number of units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay
the minimum quarterly distribution on all units."

by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$168.3 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
access to the public equity markets. We currently intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering, together with our existing cash resources to fund continued
investment in our research and development platforms (including up to
approximately $29.0 million to fund our stock purchase commitments in
conjunction with our ECC with ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc.), further our business
development efforts to consummate new ECCs with companies across various end
markets, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. We have not determined the
amounts we may spend on any of the items listed above or the timing of these
expenditures. The amounts and timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary
depending on numerous factors, including: our ability to enter into new ECCs and
the frequency with which we execute these new ECCs; the timing and amounts of
cash received as upfront or milestone payments, reimbursement of our research
and development services, and royalties received on sales of products enabled by
using our technologies from existing and new ECCs; the status and results of
ongoing research and development; and the timing and amount of capital
investments we may be obligated to make in affiliated entities, including our
$29.0 million stock purchase commitment in ZIOPHARM and any additional
investments we elect to make in AquaBounty. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from
this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the
application of net proceeds. Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds
of this offering for the acquisition or licensing, as the case may be, of
additional technologies, other assets or businesses, we have no current
understandings, agreements or commitments to do so.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash expected to be received
from our current collaborators will be sufficient to fund our operations for at
least the next 12 months.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments, certificates of
deposit and direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

Remaining net proceeds, if any, will be used for working capital and general
corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions.

As of August 1, 2013, we had $72 million of outstanding borrowings under our
credit agreement. Our credit agreement matures on March 19, 2018 and bears
interest at a variable rate, which was approximately 1.7% as of August 1, 2013.
The borrowings to be repaid were incurred primarily to fund our acquisitions and
development program. Amounts repaid under our credit agreement may be reborrowed
at any time.

We will not receive any proceeds from sales by the Apollo Funds, including
pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of common
stock.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our credit
agreement and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering."

common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of $16.00 per
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $57.0 million, or
$65.9 million if the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares is
exercised in full.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for general
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We
intend to use $2.1 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay off the
remaining amounts owed under a litigation settlement agreement.

In addition, if appropriate opportunities arise to acquire or invest in
complementary technologies, assets or businesses, we may use a portion of the
net proceeds for such acquisition or investment. However, we are not currently
discussing any such potential acquisition or investment with any third party.
The amount and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of
factors, including competitive and technological developments and the rate of
growth, if any, of our business.

Pending their use, we plan to invest our net proceeds from this offering
in short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.

$49.0 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that our net
proceeds will be approximately $57.0 million, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We intend to use up to approximately $28 million of the net proceeds from this
offering through 2014 to expand capacity at the manufacturing facility we
acquired in July 2012, as described further below. In addition, we intend to use
a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for other capital expenditures,
including purchasing equipment to facilitate our research and development
efforts, working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also use a
portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products or
technologies. However, as of the date of this prospectus, we cannot estimate the
amount of net proceeds that will be used for the other purposes described above,
and we do not have agreements reached or commitments made for any specific
acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies.

Based on forecasted volumes and sales growth, we currently anticipate making
aggregate capital expenditures of $5.0 million to $7.0 million for the nine
months ending December 31, 2013, in addition to using $19.0 million to
$21.0 million to expand capacity at our manufacturing facility in 2014. We
expect to fully fund such expenditures using both available cash and a portion
of the net proceeds from this offering.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures, including expenditures
related to our manufacturing facility, will depend on numerous factors,
including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing
activities, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations and
competitive pressures. We expect that our current resources, together with the
proceeds from this offering and future operating revenue, will be sufficient to
fund operations, including the expenditures described above, for at least the
next 24 months.

Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public
market for our common stock, increase our visibility in the marketplace and
provide liquidity to existing stockholders. Creating a public market for our
common stock will facilitate our ability to raise additional equity in the
future and to use our common stock as a means of attracting and retaining key
employees and as consideration for acquisitions.

We will have broad discretion in the way that we use the net proceeds of this
offering. The amounts that we actually spend for the purposes described above
may vary significantly and will depend, in part, on the timing and amount of our
future revenues, our future expenses and any potential acquisitions that we may
propose. Pending any use, as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds
in a variety of capital preservation instruments, including short- and long-term
interest-bearing investments, direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government, certificates of deposit and money market funds. We cannot predict
whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return for us."

2013, the interest rate on the Term Loan, which is scheduled to mature on
April 23, 2020, was 4.5%. A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan were used
to repay in full the outstanding balance of $403.1 million under our Former
Credit Facilities. We used the remaining proceeds of the Term Loan, together
with cash on hand, to make a distribution to our equity holders, to make
payments to vested option holders, and to pay transaction fees and expenses.

corporate purposes. We will have broad discretion in the way we use the net

and other estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We expect that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our Class A common shares
to AH LLC and APFC in the concurrent private placements will be $75 million. We
will not pay any underwriting discounts or placement fees in connection with the
concurrent private placements.

We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placements to our operating partnership in exchange for OP units. Our operating
partnership intends to use the net proceeds received from our contribution
(i) to repay the indebtedness we have incurred or expect to incur under our
credit facility, (ii) to acquire and renovate single-family properties,
including the escrowed properties in accordance with our business strategy 
described in this prospectus and (iii) for general business purposes. As of 
July 9, 2013, we had 1,077 properties in escrow, with an estimated total 
investment of $176 million. At July 9, 2013, we had $750 million of borrowings 
outstanding under our credit facility, which was incurred to acquire and 
renovate single family properties. Our credit facility bears interest at 30 day
LIBOR plus 2.75%. We may borrow under our credit facility (other than the 
temporary increase in our credit facility) until March 7, 2015, which period 
may be extended for an additional year, subject to the satisfaction of certain 
financial covenant tests. Our credit facility will mature one year after the 
expiration of such period. Upon completion of this offering, we will extinguish
the commitments under the temporary increase in our credit facility.

Pending application of any portion of the net proceeds, we or our operating
partnership will invest such funds in interest-bearing accounts and short-term
interest-bearing securities consistent with our intention to qualify for
taxation as a REIT. These investments are expected to provide lower net returns
than we will seek to achieve with our target assets."

.   approximately $8.5 million to pay any amount drawn on the BMO Facility;

.   approximately $1.2 million to pay an initial dividend; and

.   approximately $1.0 million for general corporate purposes.

Two of the vessels on order in the Initial Fleet, Hull S-5118 and Hull S-5119,
have bank financing in place with DVB Bank. The remaining vessels on order in
the Initial Fleet will be funded by a portion of the proceeds of this offering
and a portion of the proposed new credit facility.

We have received non-binding indicative terms from our relationship banks for a
new $235 million senior secured credit facility. We expect to incur $45.0
million of indebtedness under our new senior secured credit facility to fund a
portion of the expenditure for the vessels on order in our Initial Fleet and we
expect to incur $190.0 million of indebtedness, and use cash from operations, to
fund the remaining amount required to purchase the vessels in our Expansion
Fleet that we intend to acquire, subject to the completion of this offering. We
cannot assure you, however, that we will be successful in acquiring vessels at
prices comparable to current market prices. In the event that we are not able to
conclude the acquisition of the vessels proposed in the Expansion Fleet, we will
use the proceeds to acquire other newbuilding re-sales, contract orders for
newbuildings or acquire individual ships as they become available in the
secondhand market.

We expect that there will be $8.5 million drawn down on the BMO facility as of
the date of this offering. There is no maturity date on this loan facility. The
interest rate on the BMO Facility is LIBOR plus 5.00%. Repayments on the BMO

U.S. public markets should we need more capital in the future, increase the
profile and prestige of our company with existing and possible future customers
and strategic partners and make our shares more valuable and attractive to our
employees and potential employees for compensation purposes.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering to meet our anticipated
increased working capital requirements resulting from the expected growth in our
business and for other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of
our net proceeds to fund the construction of the additional manufacturing
facility that we intend to build. We have not yet determined whether we will
fund the cost of construction using debt or cash on hand (including a portion of
the net proceeds of this offering). Whether we use a portion of the net proceeds
for that purpose will depend on the terms of other funding sources available to
us at the time. We do not currently have specific plans or commitments with
respect to the net proceeds from this offering and, accordingly, are unable to
quantify the allocation of such proceeds among the various potential uses.

Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net

connection with the Contribution Transactions, (ii) to repay the $56.0 million 
outstanding under our revolving credit facility, which bore interest at a rate

general corporate purposes. The loans under our revolving credit facility,

Eurodollar rate loans. The base rate loans accrue interest at the fluctuating 
rate per annum equal to 2.5% plus the greatest of the (i) the prime rate, (ii) 
the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the Eurodollar rate that
would be in effect for a Eurodollar rate loan with an interest period of one 
month plus 1.00%. The Eurodollar rate loans will accrue interest at a rate per 
annum equal to LIBOR, as published by Reuters plus 3.50%. Affiliates of BMO 
Capital Markets Corp., RBC Capital Markets, LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC 
are lenders under our revolving credit facility and, accordingly, will receive 
a substantial portion of the net proceeds from this offering used to repay 
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Certain of our 
executive officers have an economic interest in PEG LP and, as a result, these 
individuals will have an interest in the proceeds from this offering received 
by PEG LP in proportion to their respective economic interest in PEG LP.

In connection with the Contribution Transactions referred to in (i) above, we 
will also issue to PEG LP 19,445,000 Class A shares and 15,555,000 Class B 
shares as consideration for the assets it will contribute to us.

The underwriters may also purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 Class A shares
from the selling shareholder at the public offering price, less the underwriting
commissions, within 30 days from the closing date of this offering to cover 
overallotments, if any. We estimate that the net proceeds to the selling 
shareholder will be approximately $49.9 million, after deducting underwriting 
commissions and assuming the exercise in full of the underwriters’ overallotment
option. We will not receive any proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ 
overallotment option. The selling shareholder will pay the underwriters’ 
commissions and the expenses of the offering applicable to the sale of shares 
pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option.

outstanding Class A shares and 99.1% of our outstanding Class B shares (or

option in full), representing in the aggregate an approximate 67.9% voting 
interest in our company (or 63.2% if the underwriters exercise their 
overallotment option in full). The remaining 0.9% of our outstanding Class B

TriplePoint Capital LLC. As of June 30, 2013, the outstanding balance of our
equipment line was approximately $6.9 million and bore interest at a fixed rate
of 5.75%, and the outstanding balance of our growth capital loan was

factors, including the cash used in or generated by our operations, the status
of our development, the level of our sales and marketing activities, and our
technology investments and acquisitions. Our management has discretion over many
of these factors. Therefore, we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of
net proceeds from this offering that will be used for any of the purposes
described above. Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering as described

believe we will use between $50 million and $60 million of our net proceeds from 
this offering to fund our operations for the next 12 months. The exact amount of 
net proceeds we use for our operations and expansion plans, however, will

The primary purposes of this offering are to obtain additional equity capital,
create a public market for our ordinary shares, and facilitate future access to
capital via public markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with available funds, for general corporate purposes,
including working capital for our operating subsidiaries outside China and
making payments to our suppliers overseas, capital expenditures relating to the
expansion of our operations, and funding possible future acquisitions. We have
not determined any particular capital expenditures for which we will use the net
proceeds, and the timing and size of our particular capital expenditure needs
may change rapidly in response to perceived market opportunities, technological
changes and actions by our competitors. We do not currently have any agreements
or understandings for material acquisitions for which we intend to allocate a
portion of the net proceeds. Therefore, our management is currently unable to
allocate any specific portions of the net proceeds for particular uses. We
currently do not intend to use any proceeds from the offering to fund our
operations or capital expenditures in China or otherwise transfer the proceeds

deposit the proceeds into interest-bearing bank accounts.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we, as an offshore holding company,
are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our consolidated
affiliated entities only through loans, in each case subject to satisfaction of
applicable government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals
on a timely basis, if at all. Currently, the working capital requirements of our
PRC subsidiaries are primarily funded by their operating income generated from
providing services to our non-PRC operating entities, including research and
development and marketing services. We expect our PRC operating subsidiaries to
continue to fund their working capital requirements in this manner for the
foreseeable future.

Our plans for the proceeds of this offering are subject to change due to
unforeseen events and opportunities, and the amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures depend on several factors, including our expansion plans and the

this offering will be approximately $30.8 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The selling
stockholders will sell shares in this offering only if the over-allotment option
is exercised. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the
selling stockholders.

The primary purposes for this offering are to allow us to increase our
amount of working capital, to allow the possibility of repaying some portion of
our indebtedness in advance of its maturity date, to fund capital expenditures
or make investments in or acquisitions of other businesses, products, or
technologies, and to create a public market for shares of our common stock. We
anticipate that we may use approximately $9.3 million of our net proceeds to
repay outstanding indebtedness, which currently has interest rates ranging from
4.375% to 6.875% and maturity dates ranging from September 2013 to November
2014. We anticipate that we may use $10.0 million of our net proceeds on capital
expenditures over the next twelve months to purchase equipment to support the
manufacturing of our products and the development of our technologies. We may
also use a portion of net proceeds to expand our current business through
strategic alliances with, or acquisitions of, other businesses, products or
technologies. Because we currently have no agreements or commitments for any
such specific alliances or acquisitions, we have not identified what portion, if
any, of the net proceeds will be used for this purpose. Other than as described
above, we do not have current specific plans for the use of the net proceeds
from this offering. Pending any use above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
investment-grade, short-term, interest-bearing securities.

Management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
the offering. The amount and timing of our actual spending for these purposes
may vary significantly from our plans and will depend on a number of factors,
including our future revenues, cash generated by operations and other factors.
We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds for other 
purposes."

offering will be approximately $58.5 million, at the initial public offering
price of $10.00 per share after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated
offering expenses that we must pay. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option
in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $67.5 million.

The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our capitalization,
financial flexibility and visibility in the marketplace. We currently intend to
use the net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
including to finance our growth, develop new solutions, hire additional
personnel and fund capital expenditures and potential acquisitions. We may
pursue the acquisition of companies or businesses with complementary products
and technologies that we believe will enhance our suite of offerings, however we
do not have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this
time. Although we have no current specific plans with respect to the allocation
of the net proceeds of this offering, for the next year, assuming we engage in
no acquisitions, we intend to use approximately $20 million to $30 million of
our net proceeds, together with the cash generated from operations, to fund our
current operations, repay short-term intercompany payables owed to our parent,
Compuware, subsequent to its contribution of assets and liabilities to us as of
January 1, 2013 in the amount of $9.4 million as of June 30, 2013, implement our
growth strategies and fund capital expenditures.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds
that we receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion
in using these proceeds. Furthermore, the amount and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the cash used in or
generated by our operations, the status of our development activities, the level
of our sales and marketing activities, our technology investments and any
potential acquisitions. Our management also has discretion over many of these
factors. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we
plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term
and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
investments, certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $95.7 million based upon the
initial public offering price of $18.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares
in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $110.5 million,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and to facilitate our
access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to use the net proceeds
from this offering as follows:

. approximately $18.0 million for the expansion of our commercial operations, 
  including the growth of our sales force within the United States and 
  internationally;       

. approximately $10.0 million for the expansion of our laboratory operations to 
  support future growth;   

. approximately $12.0 million to fund ongoing and new clinical trials to    
  demonstrate the utility of our products and support our reimbursement efforts;
  and 

. approximately $10.0 million to continue the expansion of our technology   
  infrastructure and capabilities for our molecular information platform.   

We expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from this offering for new
product development, including costs related to the development of products in
areas such as epigenetics, methylation, and immune response, capital
expenditures, including costs related to required expansion in connection with
increased demand, and working capital and other general corporate purposes,
including the costs of operating as a public company. Although we currently
anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as described
above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of funds is necessary.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including our commercialization efforts, demand for our products, rates
of reimbursement, the costs of equipment, the progress of our research and
development efforts, our operating costs and the other factors. Accordingly, 
our management will have flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this 
offering. An investor will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, 
financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use the 
proceeds.

The costs and timing of our commercialization efforts are highly uncertain, are
subject to substantial risks and can often change. Accordingly, we may change
the allocation of use of these proceeds among the uses described above as a
result of contingencies such as the demand for our products, rates of
reimbursement, the costs of equipment, the progress of our research and
development efforts and operating costs and expenditures. Although we may use a
portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the acquisition or licensing,
as the case may be, of additional technologies, other assets or businesses, or
for other strategic investments or opportunities, we have no current
understandings, agreements or commitments to do so.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high quality,
investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government, or hold as cash."

we are offering will be approximately $21.9 million (or $25.4 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), based on the initial
public offering price of $12.00 per share, and after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use $15.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering for research
and development activities for EVK-001, including our planned Phase 3 clinical
trial of EVK-001. In addition, we intend to use $2.1 million of the net proceeds
from this offering to make monthly principal and interest payments on our loan
with Silicon Valley Bank. Advances under the loan and security agreement have an
interest-only period through December 31, 2013, and a 24-month payback period
commences in January 2014. We intend to use the remaining proceeds from this
offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in
complementary businesses or products; however, we have no current commitments or
obligations to do so. Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities or certificates of deposit.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through approximately 18 months after the date of this prospectus,
although there can be no assurance in that regard. In particular, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to commence our planned
Phase 3 clinical trial of EVK-001. Because we expect this clinical trial to
commence in the first half of 2014 with an approximately 12 month enrollment
period, we will need to obtain additional funds to complete this trial as well
as finance any additional development requirements requested by the FDA.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and other development
efforts for EVK-001, as well as the amount of cash used in our operations. We
therefore cannot estimate the amount of net proceeds to be used for the purposes
described above. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds
for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net
proceeds from this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$175.7 million.

As of June 30, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
$39.9 million. In August 2013, we received $33.3 million in additional proceeds
from the sale of 13,333,333 shares of our series C preferred stock. We also have
aggregate expected funding under our royalty agreement with Novo A/S of
approximately $83.3 million, subject to enrollment of specified numbers of
patients in our Phase 3 clinical trials of Fovista and our satisfying additional
closing conditions and other obligations. We currently estimate that we will use
the net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and cash equivalents
as of June 30, 2013, the proceeds from our sale of shares of series C preferred
stock in August 2013 and the expected funding under our royalty agreement, as
follows:

.  approximately $175 million to fund, and obtain initial, top-line data from, 
   our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista administered in combination with 
   anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and to fund pre-approval
   commercialization efforts for Fovista;  

.  approximately $5 million for smaller exploratory trials of Fovista for the
   treatment of additional indications and for other patient populations;    

.  approximately $5 million to pursue the clinical development of ARC1905 for
   the treatment of AMD; and                                                 

.  the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which
   may include the acquisition or licensing of other products or technologies.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2013, the proceeds from our sale of shares
of series C preferred stock in August 2013 and the expected funding under our
royalty agreement represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products,
businesses or technologies.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents and expected funding under our royalty agreement
described above, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to
obtain initial top-line data from our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and
to complete a small exploratory clinical trial of ARC1905 in patients with wet
AMD who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy and
are defined as anti-VEGF resistant on the basis of complement mediated
inflammation. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be
wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently
expect. This estimate assumes, among other things, that we receive the full
financing amount available under our royalty agreement with Novo A/S on a timely
basis. The royalty agreement with Novo A/S provides that we will use the
remaining proceeds we received and future proceeds, if any, under the royalty
agreement primarily to support clinical development and regulatory activities
for Fovista and for certain other permitted purposes. We do not anticipate that
the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents
and expected funding under our royalty agreement will be sufficient to allow us
to fund the commercial launch of Fovista.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

Management’s plans for the proceeds of this offering are subject to change due
to unforeseen events and opportunities, and the amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures depend on several factors including, but not limited to, the cash
used in or generated by our operations. Accordingly, our management team will
have broad discretion in using the net proceeds from this offering. Therefore,
we are unable to estimate the amount of net proceeds from this offering that
will be used for any of the potential purposes described above. Pending the use
of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

global offering are expected to be approximately U.S.$195.9 million after
deducting estimated discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us. We
currently intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the global offering
to prepay principal and interest under our loans with:

(a) Banco Inbursa, dated May 12, 2009, in an aggregate principal amount 
    outstanding of Ps.257.1 million. Interest under this loan is payable 
    semi-annually at an annual rate of the Mexican Interbank Rate of Equilibrium
    (Tasa de Interé s Interbancaria de Equilibrio) plus ten percentage points, 
    which has increased by 2.5 percentage points since May 14, 2012. Currently,
    the principal may be prepaid subject to certain conditions including a 
    prepayment premium equivalent to 25% of the amount to be prepaid (Ps.64.3 
    million). Also, 50% of any principal balance has to be paid on May 12, 2015
    and any remaining principal balance has to be paid on May 12, 2016; 

(b) Pasprot, dated May 12, 2009, in an aggregate principal amount outstanding of
    Ps.3.3 million. Interest under this loan is payable semi-annually at an 
    annual rate of the Mexican Interbank Rate of Equilibrium ( Tasa de Interé s
    Interbancaria de Equilibrio ) plus ten percentage points, which has 
    increased by 2.5 percentage points since May 14, 2012. The prepayment 
    premium is Ps.0.8 million. This loan agreement has substantially the same 
    terms as the loan agreement with Banco Inbursa, including the terms 
    relating to prepayments; and 

(c) IFC, dated June 23, 2006, in an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 
    U.S.$10.0 million under tranche C. Interest is payable semi-annually at the
    six-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus six percentage 
    points. Principal may be prepaid subject to certain conditions. The final 
    maturity under tranche C is June 15, 2014. 

As of June 30, 2013, we were current with principal and interest payments and 
in compliance with the covenants under our loan agreements. 

The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, 
including pre-delivery payments of aircraft. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Series A shares or ADSs by 
the selling shareholders."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their    
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the      
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $100,000 as described in this    
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out  
    of the $500,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment 
    of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that  
    offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts    
    will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial       
    business combination, up to $4,375,000, which constitutes the underwriters’  
    deferred commissions (or up to $5,031,250 if the underwriters’ over-
    allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters 
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase 
    price of the business or businesses with which our initial business 
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or 
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest 
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, approximately $125,000,000 (or approximately $143,750,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$4,375,000 (or up to $5,031,250 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $25,000 per year, assuming an interest rate
of 0.02% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
income taxes and franchise taxes, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our
initial business combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares
if we are unable to complete a business combination within 21 months (or 24
months, as applicable) from the closing of this offering (subject to the
requirements of law). Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that the
interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay income taxes and
franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability 
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek 
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or 
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or 
their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance 
funds to, or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement with the Clinton Group
pursuant to which we will pay the Clinton Group a total of $10,000 per month for
office space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has loaned us $100,000 to be
used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 1, 2013
or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $500,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. The terms of such
loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no
written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations 
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable 
to complete our business combination within 21 months following the closing of 
this offering (or 24 months from the closing of this offering if we have 
executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for 
an initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of this 
offering but have not completed the initial business combination within such 
21-month period), subject to applicable law and as further described herein and 
any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the 
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a 
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust 
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the
remainder of the 750,000 additional common units, if any, will be issued to
OCI Holdings. Any such units issued to OCI Holdings will be issued for no
additional consideration. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase

approximately US$170.1 million, or approximately US$196.1 million if the 
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional ADSs, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. In addition, we expect to receive net proceeds of 
approximately US$15.0 million from the concurrent private placement. 

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for general 
corporate purposes, which may include investment in product development, 
engineering capability, sales and marketing activities, technology 
infrastructure, capital expenditures, improvement of corporate facilities and 
other general and administrative matters. We may also use a portion of these 
proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or 
businesses that complement our business, although we have no present commitments 
or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or investments. 

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and 
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our 
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply 
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business 
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as 
described in this prospectus. 

Pending any use as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in short-
term financial instruments or demand deposits. 

Under PRC laws and regulations, we are permitted to utilize the proceeds from 
this offering to fund our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital 
contributions, subject to applicable government registration and approval 
requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these 
requirements on a timely basis, if at all. We currently plan to use a 
substantial portion of proceeds from this offering to increase the registered 
capital of Wanglin and 58 Technology and will apply to obtain approval from the 
Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts for such increases and register 
the changes with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the SAFE 
or their local counterparts. We currently do not plan to use the proceeds from 
this offering to fund the operations of Beijing 58, our consolidated affiliated 
entity, and its subsidiaries."
"VERACYTE, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/veracyte-inc-729484-73535,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/veracyte-inc-729484-73535,424B4,10/30/2013,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=9577162,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock 
in this offering will be approximately $58.0 million, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment option to purchase additional shares 
from us is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately $67.0 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and to 
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We currently intend 
to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $20.0 million for selling and marketing activities, including 
  expansion of our sales force to support the ongoing commercialization of our 
  current products and future products;

. approximately $20.0 million for research and development, including medical 
  and clinical costs, related to the continued support of Afirma as well as the 
  development of our product pipeline; and

. the remainder for general and administrative expenses (including compensation 
  of our officers and directors and other personnel-related costs and costs of 
  operating as a public company), and for working capital and other general 
  corporate purposes.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could 
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. As of the 
date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular 
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering. We 
will have discretion in the way that we use the net proceeds and investors will 
be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of 
this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on 
numerous factors, including the following: the timing and amount of our cash 
receipts from the sale of Afirma; the timing and amount of our expenses related 
to the sale of Afirma, including the payments we are required to make as a 
result of our co-promotion agreement and costs related to geographical 
expansion of our sales efforts; the completion or termination of our clinical 
trials and other studies and the results of such trials or studies; costs 
related to sample acquisition for clinical trials; the progress of our 
preclinical research efforts; changes in the level of FDA regulation applicable 
to Afirma or future tests we may develop, and costs of compliance with 
regulation of Afirma outside of the United States; identification of 
opportunities to acquire businesses or assets or license technologies that we 
believe are in the best interests of our stockholders; or other material 
unforeseen cash needs.

Depending on the outcome of these factors, our plans and priorities may change, 
and we may be required to apply the net proceeds of this offering differently 
than we currently anticipate, and it may be necessary to allocate more or less 
of the net proceeds to the categories described above. We do not expect that we 
will decrease our estimated allocations to research and development or selling 
and marketing to fund potential acquisitions or for general and administrative 
expenses if doing so would have an adverse effect on the financial resources we 
believe will be necessary for us to pursue our business goals.


Alternative uses for the net proceeds include:

. increased allocation to research and development in the event we decide to 
  focus our efforts on new disease indications, new products or the acceleration
  of the development of products in our pipeline, or that we are required to 
  conduct additional clinical trials or other research and development 
  activities in response to changes in FDA regulations applicable to Afirma or 
  other tests we may develop, or regulations related to selling Afirma outside 
  of the United States;

. decreased allocation to research and development in the event we abandon or 
  are unable to continue any of our current research and development activities,
  trials or studies, or complete current research and development activities 
  and elect not to begin new research and development efforts;

. increased allocation to selling and marketing activities to drive increased 
  adoption of Afirma, accelerate our international expansion efforts or to 
  address unanticipated challenges in connection with our international 
  expansion, or in order to comply with payment obligations under our co-
  promotion agreement;

. decreased allocation to selling and marketing in the event we decide to 
  forego, scale-back or delay our expansion into international markets, or 
  decide not to increase our internal selling and marketing efforts;

. increased allocation to general and administrative in the event we increase 
  our billing and collections and customer service capabilities to address 
  increased adoption of and reimbursement for Afirma; and

. increased allocation to research and development or selling and marketing, as 
  applicable, in the event we license complementary technologies or acquire 
  complementary businesses or other assets, although we have no current 
  commitments, understandings or agreements with respect to any material 
  acquisition or license.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds in short- and 
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government."

offered hereby are estimated to be approximately $171.8 million after deducting
the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We
intend to use the net proceeds to redeem all $150.0 million aggregate principal
amount of the 10.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2017 (at a purchase
price equal to $155.0 million, 103.333% of their principal amount, plus $5.1
million of accrued and unpaid interest through the date of redemption, assuming
a redemption date of November 15, 2013) and any remaining net proceeds for
general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior
Subordinated Notes were used to fund a portion of the purchase price paid by TPG
and the other co-investors to purchase our company in 2007 and to pay related
fees and expenses.

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we may hold
any net proceeds in cash or invest them in short-term securities or investments.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the
selling stockholders named in this prospectus. After deducting the underwriting
discount, the selling stockholders will receive approximately $43.2 million of
proceeds from this offering if the underwriters do not exercise their option to
purchase additional shares of our common stock and approximately $76.2 million
of proceeds if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares of our common stock in full.

Affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC, an underwriter of this offering, will own in
excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock following our
conversion into a Delaware corporation. Therefore, a “conflict of interest” is
deemed to exist under FINRA Rule 5121(f)(5)(B). In addition, because the TPG
Funds are affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC and, as selling stockholders, will
receive more than 5% of the net proceeds of this offering, a “conflict of
interest” is also deemed to exist under FINRA Rule 5121(f)(5)(C)(ii).
Accordingly, this offering will be made in compliance with the applicable
provisions of FINRA Rule 5121. Pursuant to that rule, the appointment of a
qualified independent underwriter is not necessary in connection with this
offering. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5121(c), no sales of the shares will be
made to any discretionary account over which TPG Capital BD, LLC exercises
discretion without the prior specific written approval of the account holder."

deducting estimated underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses
payable by us, will be approximately $773.7 million, or approximately
$891.3 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares from us.

Brixmor Property Group Inc. will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to
BPG Subsidiary in exchange for a number of BPG Subsidiary Shares that is equal
to the number of shares that we issue to investors in this offering. BPG
Subsidiary will in turn contribute this amount to our Operating Partnership in
exchange for a number of OP Units that is equal to the number of BPG Subsidiary
Shares that BPG Subsidiary so issues to Brixmor Property Group Inc.

Our Operating Partnership will primarily use the net proceeds from this 
offering to repay $699.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving 
portion of the Unsecured Credit Facility, which will mature in 2017. Borrowings 
under the revolving facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.70%. The 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility to be repaid with proceeds from 
this offering will have been used to repay indebtedness of our Operating 
Partnership and its subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes. Affiliates 
of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our Unsecured Credit Facility, 
which we intend to repay in part with the net proceeds of this offering, and 
accordingly will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering. 
We will also use the net offering proceeds to repay $66.6 million of 
indebtedness to our Sponsor attributable to certain of the Acquired Properties, 
to pay approximately $2.0 million of transaction costs related to the IPO 
Property Transfers, which relate to, among other things, transfer taxes and 
loan consent fees, and to pay approximately $5.4 million of transfer fees due 
to lenders on several of our outstanding mortgage loans that are payable in

offering will be $228.8 million, based on the initial public offering price of
$31.00 per ADS, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a
public market for the ADSs. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from
this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working
capital, sales and marketing activities, research and development, product
development, general and administrative matters, and capital expenditures. We
may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment
in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business.

Our management will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of our net
proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of these expenditures will
vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated by
our operations, competitive and technological developments, and the rate of
growth, if any, of our business. For example, if we were to expand our
operations more rapidly than anticipated by our current plans, a greater portion
of the proceeds would likely be used for working capital and other capital
expenditures. Alternatively, if we were to engage in an acquisition that
contained a significant cash component, some or all of the proceeds might be
used for that purpose.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

(1)A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
   FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
   portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
   received from Eric S. Rosenfeld described below. These funds will be repaid 
   out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.  

(2)No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of 
   the private units.  

(3)The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our 
   expenses relating to acquiring a target business, including a fee payable to 
   EarlyBirdCapital in an amount equal to 3.75% of the total gross proceeds 
   raised in the offering described below.  

(4)The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant 
   at $550,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest 
   income earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of 
   taxes owed on such interest income) in an amount up to $750,000 will be 
   available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. We estimate 
   the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $150,000 
   over a 24-month period assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.1% per 
   year.  

(5)These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
   all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
   example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
   estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business 
   combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. 
   We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
   fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
   fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
   category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.  

Our sponsors and EarlyBirdCapital have committed that they and/or their
designees will purchase the private units (for an aggregate purchase price of
$5,425,000) from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the
consummation of this offering. Our sponsors and EarlyBirdCapital have also
agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in
full or in part, they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the
number of private units (up to a maximum of 65,625 private units) that is
necessary to maintain in the trust account an amount equal to approximately
$10.20 per share of common stock sold to the public in this offering. The
foregoing purchases will only be made by our sponsors and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc.
(and/or its designees) if they are able to do so in accordance with Regulation M
and Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. All of the
proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account
described below.

$85,645,000, or $98,491,750 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds
held in the trust account will be invested only in United States government
treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S.
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (1) interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other
tax obligations and (2) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
that may be released to us for our working capital requirements, the proceeds
will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion
of our initial business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding
public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required
time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial
business combination to the extent not used to pay converting stockholders. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Crescendo Advisors II, LLC, an affiliate of Eric S. Rosenfeld, of
a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being
agreed to by Crescendo Advisors II, LLC for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Mr. Rosenfeld with compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based
on rents and fees for similar services in New York City, that the fee charged by
Crescendo Advisors II, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained
from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of
our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of
any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees or other similar compensation)
will be paid to our sponsors, members of our management team or any of our or
their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Since 
the role of present management after our initial business combination is 
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be 
paid to those persons after our initial business combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $550,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) up to
$750,000 may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in
searching for our initial business combination. We intend to use the after-tax
interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to
assist us with our search for a target business and for director and officer
liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the
event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsors, officers
and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available to us from the trust account is insufficient as a result of
the current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to
EarlyBirdCapital in an amount equal to 3.75% of the total gross proceeds raised
in the offering upon consummation of our initial business combination for acting
as our investment banker on a non-exclusive basis to assist us in structuring
and negotiating a business combination (but not for the purpose of identifying a
target business). To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in
part as consideration to effect our initial business combination, the proceeds
held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Mr. Rosenfeld has agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of June 30, 2013, Eric S. Rosenfeld loaned to us an aggregate of $65,000 to
be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and
expenses. The loan is payable without interest on the earlier of (i) June 26,
2014, (ii) the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or (iii)
the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering.
The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for
payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our sponsors, officers and directors may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be
evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation
of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s
discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of
our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per
unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000 shares
of common stock if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 rights
included in the private units would result in the issuance of 5,000 shares of
common stock upon the closing of our business combination). Our stockholders
have approved the issuance of the shares of common stock upon conversion of such
notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the
consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete our
initial business combination, the loans will not be repaid.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (1) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period or (2) if that public
stockholder elects to convert shares of common stock in connection with a
stockholder vote. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

Certain of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus are being sold 
by the selling stockholder. The selling stockholder in this offering is Carlyle.
We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling 
stockholder in this offering, including from any exercise by the underwriters 
of their option to purchase additional shares.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering, plus cash on hand, 
to redeem approximately $399 million in principal amount of the 2019 Notes, 
which bear interest at 8.25% per annum and to pay related premiums, expenses 
and accrued interest. As of June 30, 2013, the aggregate principal amount 
outstanding of the 2019 Notes was $1,500.0 million, excluding accrued and 
unpaid interest of $57.1 million. The 2019 Notes mature on January 15, 2019. On

35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes at a redemption price 
of 108.250% plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date using the

units to the public, after deducting underwriting discounts, the structuring fee
and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $140.2 million. We intend
to use the net proceeds from this offering to reduce amounts outstanding under
the working capital facility of our new credit agreement. We anticipate that we
will borrow under our working capital facility during the 60 days following the
closing of this offering in an amount at least equal to the net proceeds from
our sale of common units in this offering to finance our working capital
requirements. We expect amounts drawn under the working capital facility will be
used to finance inventory and accounts receivable (up to $750.0 million).
Immediately following the completion of this offering, we expect to have
available undrawn borrowing capacity of approximately $71.6 million under the
working capital facility of our new credit agreement. Together with cash flow
from operations, we expect our working capital facility will be sufficient to
cover our working capital needs until inventory is sold for cash and debt is
paid down.

As of September 30, 2013, we had approximately $246.5 million outstanding under
the working capital facility of our current credit agreement with a year-to-date
annualized interest rate of 5.8% and approximately $132.7 million outstanding
under the acquisition facility of our current credit agreement with a
year-to-date annualized interest rate of 6.2%. Borrowings under the working
capital facility have been primarily used for the purchase, storage and sale of
refined products, natural gas and coal, as well as other energy products, and
for hedging, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our new
credit agreement is expected to mature in 2018 on or about the fifth anniversary
of the completion of this offering. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters
will be lenders under our new credit agreement and, accordingly, will receive a
portion of the proceeds from this offering. In addition, affiliates of certain
of the underwriters are lenders under our existing credit agreement and may
receive payments in connection with the repayment of our existing credit
agreement. 

We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,275,000
additional common units if the underwriters sell more than the 8,500,000 common
units offered hereby. All of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of
common units pursuant to any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional common units (approximately $21.5 million, if exercised in full,
after deducting underwriting discounts and the structuring fee) will be
distributed to Sprague Holdings as reimbursement for certain capital
expenditures made by Sprague Holdings with respect to the assets contributed to
us. If the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional
common units, we will issue 1,275,000 common units to Sprague Holdings at the
expiration of the option. If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional common units, the number of units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to any exercise will be sold to the public, and any
remaining common units not purchased by the underwriters pursuant to any
exercise of the option will be issued to Sprague Holdings at the expiration of
the option period. The exercise of the underwriters’ option will not affect the
total number of units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the
minimum quarterly distribution on all units. Sprague Holdings has informed us
that it intends to distribute any net proceeds received by it attributable to an
exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units to Axel
Johnson. Sprague Holdings and Axel Johnson are deemed under federal securities
laws to be underwriters with respect to any common units that may be sold
pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units."

estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $267.3 million.

We intend to use a portion of our net proceeds of this offering to repay
$104.1 million of indebtedness under our second lien term loan facility
(including prepayment penalty and accrued interest). The second lien term loan
facility matures on May 9, 2020, and as of June 30, 2013, the interest rate on
the second lien term loan facility was 10.25%. This facility was originally
entered into on July 13, 2012, for the purpose of providing funding for our
acquisition of HostGator, and it was amended on November 9, 2012 in connection
with a dividend payment. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders 
under our credit facilities and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the net 
proceeds of this offering.

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified customary closing conditions,
we expect to use approximately $23.8 million of our net proceeds of this
offering to satisfy a portion of our payment obligations at the closing of our
proposed acquisition of Directi.

working capital and other general corporate purposes. In addition, we believe
that opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current business
through acquisitions of or investments in complementary products, technologies
or businesses, and we may use a portion of our net proceeds for these purposes.
We have no current agreements, commitments or understandings for any material
specific acquisitions at this time, other than the Directi transactions
described in this prospectus.

acquiring, investing in or in-licensing complementary products, technologies or 
businesses. We currently do not have any agreements or commitments with respect

numerous factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and development 
efforts, as well as any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will 
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this 
offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the NASDAQ listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we       
    received from our sponsor as part of the $50,000 non-interest bearing loan. 
    This initial loan advance will be repaid out of the proceeds of this        
    offering available to us.                                                   

(2) We have agreed to pay the underwriters deferred commissions in an amount    
    equal to approximately $0.28 per share, or $1,650,000 in the aggregate (or  
    approximately $1,897,500 in the aggregate if the over-allotment option is   
    exercised in full), from our trust account upon closing of our initial      
    business combination, as described in this prospectus. The deferred         
    commissions will be released to the underwriters only on completion of our  
    initial business combination, as described in this prospectus.              

(3) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private placement shares.

(4) The amount of proceeds held outside the trust account will remain constant  
      at $750,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.                        


(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial        
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business    
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of         
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated 
    expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates   
    for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess    
    working capital.                                                            

(6) The longer it takes us to complete our initial business combination, the    
    more likely it will be that the $750,000 of net proceeds of this offering   
    held outside the trust account will not be sufficient to satisfy our working
    capital needs. If the funds held outside the trust account, together with   
    the up to $220,000 in convertible loans made to us by our sponsor or its    
    affiliates, are insufficient to meet our working capital needs following the
    consummation of this offering, we expect that such shortfall will be        
    fulfilled by additional convertible loans made to us by our sponsor or its  
    affiliates, which loans will have no recourse against funds held in the     
    trust account. However, our sponsor and its affiliates have made no         
    commitment to fund any amounts in excess of such shortfall. Any such loan   
    would be evidenced by a promissory note and would be in addition to the     
    $50,000 our sponsor has already loaned us. The notes would either be paid   
    upon closing of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at  
    the sponsor’s discretion, the notes may be converted into shares of common  
    stock at the higher of $10.00 per share and the 30-day trailing average of  
    the closing price per share. If we do not complete a business combination,  
    we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account  
    to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would  
    be used for such repayment.

Our sponsor has committed that it and/or its designees will purchase the private
placement shares (for an aggregate purchase price of $6,450,000) from us on a
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.
Our sponsor has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by
the underwriters in full or in part, it will purchase from us at a price equal
to $10.00 per additional private placement share (up to a maximum of 76,500
additional shares) in an amount that is necessary to maintain in the trust
account an amount equal to $10.55 per share sold to the public in this offering.
These additional private placement shares will be purchased in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of shares resulting
from the exercise of the over-allotment option. Our sponsor will purchase 100%
of these private placement shares. The purchase price of the additional private
placement shares will be added to the proceeds from this offering to be held in
the trust account pending completion of our business combination.

$63,300,000, or $72,795,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement shares,
including the deferred commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the
United States at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., maintained by American Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, as trustee. The funds held in the trust account will be invested
only in United States government treasury bills having a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in
U.S. treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. We undertake not to draw down interest earned on funds
held in trust other than for franchise and income taxes to cover working capital
expenses of the business. Expenses incurred by us may be paid prior to a
business combination only from the net proceeds of this offering held outside
the trust account of approximately $750,000 and up to $220,000 in loans made to
us by our sponsor or its affiliates. Any such loan would be evidenced by a
promissory note and would be in addition to the $50,000 our sponsor has already
loaned us. The notes would either be paid upon closing of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at the sponsor’s discretion, the notes may be
converted into shares of common stock at the higher of $10.00 per share and the
30-day trailing average of the closing price per share. If the funds held
outside the trust account, together with the up to $220,000 in loans made to us
by our sponsor or its affiliates, are insufficient to meet our working capital
needs following the consummation of this offering, we expect that such shortfall
will be fulfilled by additional convertible loans made to us by our sponsor or
its affiliates, which loans will have no recourse against funds held in the
trust account. However, our sponsor and its affiliates have made no commitment
to fund any such amounts. If we do not complete a business combination, we may
use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay 
such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for 
such repayment.

The payment to our sponsor of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and
administrative services including office space at a number of premises,
utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our
sponsor for our benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor with
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on fees for similar services
in the Washington, D.C. or New York metropolitan areas, that the fee charged by
our sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our
initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of
any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees or other similar compensation)
will be paid to our sponsor, members of our management team or any of our or
their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the closing of our initial business combination (regardless of
the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants, clients or
similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.
Since the role of present management after our initial business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after our initial business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $750,000.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to close
a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to close a business combination, we will pay the
costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If
such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to pay the funds necessary
to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than $15,000)
and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned to us an aggregate of
$50,000 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced
in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the
non-refundable portion of the NASDAQ listing fee and a portion of the legal and
audit fees and expenses. The loans are payable without interest on the earlier
of (1) June 30, 2014, (2) the date on which we consummate our initial public
offering and (3) the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial
public offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
available to us for payment of offering expenses.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if
we have not completed a business combination in the required time period or (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert shares of common stock in
connection with a stockholder vote or sells such shares to us in a tender offer.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us, will be approximately $64.5 million, based on the initial public offering 
price of $13.00 per ADS. 

The selling shareholders will receive approximately $10.7 million in net 
proceeds from their sale of 900,000 ADSs in this offering, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by the selling shareholders, which will be approximately $140,000, based on the 
initial public offering price of $13.00 per ADS. If the underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate the selling shareholders 
will receive net proceeds of approximately $22.5 million. We will not receive 
any proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes: 

• approximately $40.0 million for expansion of our on-demand parts service 
  center in Europe and establishment of new on-demand parts service centers in 
  North America and Asia; 

• approximately $10.0 million for research and development and sales and 
  marketing initiatives; and 

• the remainder for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, 
  potential acquisitions. 

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and 
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans 
and business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility 
and discretion in applying the net proceeds. The occurrence of unforeseen 
events or changed market and business conditions could result in the 
application of the net proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as 
described above. Pending our use of the net proceeds as described above, we 
may invest the net proceeds in short-term bank deposits or invest them in 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

and commissions will be approximately €434 million, or €499 million if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full.

The main purposes for the offering are our intentions to repay corporate debt 
maturities, strengthen our balance sheet, improve our capital structure and 
increase our financial flexibility.

We intend to repay some of our corporate debt maturities due in 2013 and 2014 
totaling approximately €347 million including: the first installment due
under the Official Credit Institute Loan (€50 million); the entirety of the EIB
R&D&i 2007 Credit Facility and the EIB 2007 Credit Facility (€109 million);
installments due under the Swedish Export Buyer Credit Agreement and the Second
Swedish Credit Agreement (€127 million); certain corporate loans of some of our
subsidiaries (€37 million); and other corporate debt maturities (€24 million).
These corporate debt maturities carry interest costs of Euribor plus all-in
margins ranging between 0.643% and 4.75%. We expect the repayments to occur 
gradually during 2013 (approximately €47 million) and 2014 (approximately €300 
million).

We intend to deposit the remaining proceeds in cash and cash equivalents in
order to reinforce our liquidity position and strengthen our balance sheet.

We do not currently have any agreements or understandings to make any
acquisition of other businesses. To the extent that the net proceeds we receive
from the offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend
to invest our net proceeds in interest-bearing bank deposits that may be
withdrawn upon demand.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of the offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying a significant portion of the net proceeds of the
offering.

In the last twelve months we have issued, at the corporate level, €400 million 
of 2019 Convertible Notes and €250 million of Senior Unsecured Notes due 2018. 
On October 3, 2013, our subsidiary Abengoa Finance, S.A.U. issued €250 million 
of Additional Notes. The net proceeds from the 2019 Convertible Notes were used 
in part to repurchase for cash €99.9 million in principal amount of the 2014 
Convertible Notes for consideration of approximately €108 million, to repay 
€207 million of the 2010 Forward Start Facility which matured in July 2013, to 
repay €22 million of bank corporate debt in the first half of 2013, and the 
remainder will be used to repay other short-term corporate debt maturing 
throughout 2013, as deemed necessary. The net proceeds from the Senior 
Unsecured Notes due 2018 will be used to repay maturities of €200 million on the
2012 Forward Start Facility in 2014 and 2015, and the remainder to repay other 
existing corporate debt of different subsidiaries, as deemed necessary. We 
expect to use the entire amount of the net proceeds of the Additional Notes of 
€247 million to prepay maturities on the 2012 Forward Start Facility due in 
2014. Proceeds from all of these issuances will remain in cash and equivalents 
until used. The interest rates of the repaid maturities range from 3.6% to 15%.

There have been no other increases in corporate indebtedness in the last twelve 
months. Additional non-recourse indebtedness has been incurred at the 
non-recourse level, the proceeds of which have gone entirely to finance the
related projects."

any proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock by the selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, facilitate an orderly distribution of shares for the selling
stockholders, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public
market for our Class A common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds to us
from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

complementary businesses, technologies or other assets, using cash or our

respect to any specific material acquisitions or investments at this time.

Pending other uses, we intend to invest the proceeds in interest-bearing,

the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return. Our management will have
broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive from this

. Approximately $50 million and $20 million to fund clinical development 
  expenses for margetuximab and MGA271, respectively; 

. Approximately $5 million, $15 million and $10 million to fund research and 
  development expenses to advance our remaining product candidates, including

intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Due to the many
variables inherent to the development of oncology and autoimmune therapeutics at
this time, such as the timing of patient enrollment and evolving regulatory
requirements, we cannot currently predict the stage of development that our
product candidates will reach using the net proceeds of this offering. Based
upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that the net proceeds from this
offering together with our existing cash and cash equivalents and a significant
portion of the $100 million in collaboration payments we anticipate receiving
through 2015, will enable us to fund clinical development of the above product
candidates through 2015, assuming all of our collaboration programs advance as
currently contemplated.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the results of our research and development efforts, the
timing and success of pre-clinical studies, our ongoing clinical trials or
clinical trials we may commence in the future and the timing of regulatory
submissions. As a result, our management will have broad discretion over the use
of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of

the common stock offered by us after deducting underwriting discounts and

incurred primarily for our drilling and development program and for general
corporate purposes. While we currently do not have plans to immediately borrow
additional amounts under the credit facility, we may at any time reborrow
amounts repaid under the credit facility.

  offering, which vote is necessary for our preferred stock to convert into 
  common stock because, based on the price range indicated on the cover of this
  prospectus, this offering is not a “qualified public offering” as defined in 
  our certificate of incorporation;

  will not be converted into shares of our common stock upon the consummation 
  of this offering;

with Escalate Capital Partners that bear interest at an effective rate of 13.2%.

due upon the closing of this offering.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering. The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several
factors, including cash flows from our operations and the anticipated growth of
our business. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of
our management regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering. We
reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of certain

We intend to contribute the net proceeds received by us from this offering to

As of June 30, 2013, we had approximately $244 million outstanding under our

million outstanding as of September 30, 2013. The unsecured revolving credit 
facility matures on May 1, 2017 (which maturity may be extended for an 
additional one year at our option subject to certain conditions). Amounts 
outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at a 
variable rate equal to, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate, plus a spread 
that will range, depending upon our leverage ratio, from 2.10% to 2.85% for 
LIBOR rate loans or 1.10% to 1.85% for base rate loans, and bore interest at a 
rate of 2.55% as of June 30, 2013.

The proceeds of the unsecured revolving credit facility have been used to repay 
amounts outstanding under our secured credit facility, a loan secured by our 
Miami facility, a bridge loan secured by our Santa Clara facility, seller 
financing obtained to acquire our Lenexa and Dallas facilities, a loan for the 
purchase of land near our Atlanta-Suwanee facility and a loan from Chad L.

purposes.

Affiliates of each of the underwriters of this offering are lenders under our 
unsecured credit facility. As described above, our operating partnership 
intends to use the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our 
unsecured revolving credit facility. As such, these affiliates will receive 
their proportionate shares of any amount of our unsecured revolving credit 
facility that is repaid with the net proceeds of this offering. The repayment 
of amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility will not
affect the commitments of these affiliates of the underwriters to fund future

Borrowings under the Term B-1 Loan bear interest at a variable rate based upon
either LIBOR plus 5.0% per annum or the lenders’ alternative base rate plus
4.0% per annum. OCIB’s Intercompany Term Loans with OCI Fertilizer bear interest
at LIBOR plus 9.25%. As of August 31, 2013, OCIB had $125.0 million outstanding
under the Term B-1 Loan and the applicable interest rate was 6.25% per annum. As
of August 31, 2013, OCIB had approximately $170.5 million of outstanding
Intercompany Term Loans with OCI Fertilizer and the applicable interest rate was
9.43% per annum. The Term B-1 Loan matures on August 20, 2019. As of August 31,
2013, all of OCIB’s outstanding Intercompany Term Loans with OCI Fertilizer
mature on January 20, 2020.

OCIB used the proceeds from the Term B-1 Loan to repay outstanding borrowings
under the Previous B-1 Loan. OCIB used the proceeds from the Intercompany Term
Loans with OCI Fertilizer to fund the upgrade on our facility, to satisfy
working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the
remainder of the 2,625,000 additional common units, if any, will be issued to
OCI USA. Any such common units issued to OCI USA will be issued for no
additional consideration. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase additional common units from us, we expect to receive additional net
proceeds of approximately $44.3 million, after deducting the underwriting
discount and structuring fees. We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of
the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units from us to repay a
portion of OCIB’s remaining outstanding Intercompany Term Loans with OCI
Fertilizer."

concurrent private placement will be approximately $148 million (or
approximately $167.5 million if the underwriters fully exercise their
over-allotment option), after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable
by us. Our Manager has agreed to pay the entire underwriting discount and
structuring fee payable with respect to each share sold in this offering. The
underwriters will not receive a placement fee or any underwriting discount or
commission on the shares purchased by Mr. Middleman in the concurrent private
placement. We intend to contribute the net proceeds of this offering and the
concurrent private placement to our operating partnership in exchange for OP
units and cause our operating partnership to deploy these net proceeds as
follows:

. approximately $100 million to the acquisition of our Excess MSRs in the   
  Initial Pools from Freedom Mortgage; and

. approximately $38 million to investments in Agency RMBS backed by 30-year,
  20-year and 15-year FRMs.

The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate and working
capital purposes. If the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent
private placement are greater than indicated on the front cover of this
prospectus, or if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we will
use the additional proceeds to acquire additional Agency RMBS with
characteristics similar to those described above, as well as for general
corporate and working capital purposes. If the net proceeds of this offering and
the concurrent private placement are less than indicated on the front cover of
this prospectus, we will reduce the amount of proceeds committed to the
acquisition of Agency RMBS, subject to maintaining our exclusion from regulation
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

Our asset acquisition decisions will be based on market conditions and other
factors that our Manager deems relevant at the applicable time. Based on our
expectation that the acquisition of Excess MSRs on an unleveraged basis and
Agency RMBS on a leveraged basis will continue to provide attractive
opportunities, we expect that our equity capital will primarily be deployed in
Excess MSRs and Agency RMBS investments for the foreseeable future. However, we
cannot assure you that we will not change the allocation of our equity capital
over time. We will have significant flexibility, subject to our investment
guidelines, to acquire assets other than the target assets described above. We
reserve the right to change the way we allocate our capital at any time and from
time to time, depending on prevailing market conditions, including, among other
things, the pricing and supply of Excess MSRs and Agency RMBS, the performance
of our portfolio and the availability of terms for financing. Capital allocated
to a particular class of Agency RMBS may reflect the actual usage of cash, such
as in connection with the payment of the purchase price for such assets or in
connection with the posting of collateral with third parties in connection with
the financing of such assets or maintenance of such assets. While we do not
intend to use leverage to finance our Excess MSRs, we expect to borrow against
our Agency RMBS through master repurchase agreements and use the proceeds of the
borrowings to acquire additional Agency RMBS assets. Over time, we may deploy or
redeploy a portion of our capital into targeted assets other than Excess MSRs
and Agency RMBS, including prime jumbo mortgage loans and non-Agency RMBS. We
initially do not expect to acquire prime jumbo mortgage loans and non-Agency
RMBS for our portfolio during the six-month period following the completion of
this offering and the concurrent private placement.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
readily marketable, interest bearing, short-term investment grade securities or
money market accounts that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a
REIT. Such temporary investments are expected to provide a lower net return than
we anticipate achieving from our targeted investments.

Although we do not intend to use any of the net proceeds from this offering and
the concurrent private placement to fund distributions to our stockholders, to
the extent we use these net proceeds to fund distributions, these payments may
be treated as a return of capital to our stockholders."

(1) Represents balance as of June 30, 2013. At the closing of this offering, we  
    expect to have borrowings of $300,000 on the term loan secured by the Empire 
    State Building and $3,750 on the loan by an entity controlled by Anthony E.  
    Malkin and Peter L. Malkin.                                                  

Any net proceeds remaining after the uses set forth in the table above will be
used for general working capital purposes, including potential future capital
expenditures, and acquisition and development activities. If the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase an additional 10,725,000 shares of our
Class A common stock, we expect to contribute the additional net proceeds, which
will be approximately $129.7 million in the aggregate, to our operating
partnership in exchange for 10,725,000 operating partnership units. Our
operating partnership intends to use such net proceeds to repurchase shares from
the Helmsley estate at a per share price equal to the initial public offering
price less the underwriting discount and commission. We do not intend to use any
of the net proceeds from this offering to fund distributions to our
stockholders, but to the extent we use a portion of the net proceeds to fund
distributions, these payments will be treated as a return of capital to our
stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Pending the use of the net
proceeds, we intend to invest such portion of the net proceeds in
interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearingsecurities in a manner
that is consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT.

Our operating partnership will subsequently use the net proceeds received from
us as set forth in the table above.

We did not negotiate the value of our properties at arm’s-length as part of the
formation transactions. In addition, the value of the shares of our Class A
common stock, Class B common stock and the operating partnership units that we
will issue in exchange for contributed property interests and other assets,
including cash, will increase or decrease if our Class A common stock price
increases or decreases. As a result, the consideration to be given in exchange
by us for these properties and other assets may exceed their fair market value."

$194.2 million, or $224.9 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, at the initial public offering price of $22.00
per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
$11.0 million of estimated offering expenses which will be or have been incurred
by RMCO.

We intend to use approximately $27.3 million of the proceeds of this offering to
reacquire regional RE/MAX franchise rights in the Southwest and Central Atlantic
regions of the U.S. through the acquisition of the business assets of HBN and
Tails. Following our acquisition of the business assets of HBN and Tails, we
will contribute such assets to RMCO in exchange for a number of newly issued
common units of RMCO worth approximately $27.3 million, at a price per common
unit equal to the public offering price per share of our Class A common stock,
less underwriting discounts. Certain of our directors and executive officers
(and their family members), including David Liniger, Gail Liniger, Margaret
Kelly, Vincent Tracey and Daryl Jesperson, own shares of HBN and Tails. We
engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in the evaluation of the fair
market value of 100% of the equity of each of HBN and Tails and used this firm’s
analysis as the basis for determining the purchase price for these acquisitions.

We intend to use approximately $177.8 million of the proceeds of this offering
(as well as any additional proceeds received if the underwriters exercise their 
option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) to purchase newly
issued common units from RMCO at a price per common unit equal to the public 
offering price per share of our Class A common stock, less underwriting 
discounts. Of the $177.8 million of proceeds received by RMCO from us, $11.0 
million will be reserved by RMCO to pay estimated offering expenses. The 
remaining $166.8 million of proceeds received by RMCO from us will be used as 
follows: (i) RMCO will use approximately $49.9 million of the proceeds to first
redeem all of the outstanding preferred membership units in RMCO held by Weston
Presidio and to satisfy the liquidation preference associated with those 
preferred membership units; and (ii) following RMCO’s redemption of all of the 
outstanding preferred membership units in RMCO from Weston Presidio, RMCO will 
use approximately $117.0 million of the remaining proceeds (or $147.8 million if
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) to redeem common
units of RMCO from our existing owners, RIHI and Weston Presidio. The price per
common unit of RMCO paid by RMCO to our existing owners will equal the public 
offering price per share of our Class A common stock, less underwriting 
discounts."

initial public offering price of $6.00 per share, and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares in this
offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $40.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

. approximately $20.0 million to fund research and development activities to 
  advance our HSC modulation platform and the clinical and preclinical 
  development of its product candidates, including the conduct of our Phase 2 
  clinical trial of ProHema in patients with orphan hematologic malignancies; 

. approximately $12.0 million to fund research and development activities to 
  advance our SSC modulation platform and the preclinical development of its 
  product candidates, including the conduct of preclinical studies of our 
  Wnt7a analog product candidates; and 

. the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, including 
  funding the costs of operating as a public company. 

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials and preclinical studies, as well as any collaborations that we
may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, the amount of cash
available from other sources and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high quality,
investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government, or hold as cash."

approximately US$70.1 million, or approximately US$81.1 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us. In addition, we expect to receive net proceeds of
US$20.0 million from investments by Qihoo 360 and Kingsoft.

We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering and from investments by Qihoo
360 and Kingsoft primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include
investment in research and development of new mobile internet products,
services, technology and infrastructure, expanding our selling and marketing
activities, working capital needs, potential acquisitions, partnerships,
alliances and licensing opportunities.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions. Our management, however, will have significant flexibility
and discretion to apply the net proceeds from this offering and from investments
by Qihoo 360 and Kingsoft. If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions
change, we may use the net proceeds differently than as described in this
prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws
and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions, and only if we satisfy the applicable government
registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to meet these requirements on a timely basis, if at all. We currently
plan to use part of the net proceeds from this offering to increase the
registered capital of Jiubang Computer, our PRC operating subsidiary whose
authorized scope of business includes research and development of computer
software, providing computer information technology service and technology
consulting service, and selling products and services provided by the company.
We will apply to obtain approval from the Ministry of Commerce or its local
counterparts for such increase and register the changes with the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce and the SAFE or their local
counterparts. Jiubang Computer can then convert the increased registered capital
in foreign currencies into Renminbi and use the Renminbi within its approved
business scope. We may keep a portion of the net proceeds offshore for our
foreign currency needs. Due to PRC legal restrictions on loans in foreign
currencies extended to any PRC domestic companies, and because our VIEs are
generally able to conduct business with revenues generated from their own daily
operations, we do not intend to finance the activities of our VIEs with the net
proceeds of this offering.

Pending any use as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term financial instruments or demand deposits."

for the purchase of equipment and software, and the balance of the funds will be
used for general corporate purposes.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including market conditions, results from our research and development
efforts, business developments and opportunities and related rate of growth,
sales and marketing activities and competition. Accordingly, our management will
have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will
be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the
proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use
portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes. Circumstances
that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds and the alternate purposes
for which the proceeds may be used include:

. the existence of unforeseen or other opportunities or the need to take 
  advantage of changes in timing of our existing activities;

. the need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase, reduce or eliminate
  one or more existing initiatives due to, among other things, changing market
  conditions and competitive developments or interim results of research and 
  development efforts;

. results from our business development and marketing efforts, including 
  co-development and pilot site installation opportunities that may materialize;

. the effect of federal, state, and local regulation of potential customers in
  our identified industries;

. our ability to attract development funding or to license or sell our 
  technology to industry sponsors or other interested organizations; and/or

. the presentation of strategic opportunities of which we are not currently 
  aware (including acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and other similar 
  transactions).

From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate
continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of
resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being optimized."

be approximately $53.9 million after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $62.8 million after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately $25.0 million to hire additional sales, marketing and customer  
  service personnel and expand marketing programs both in the United States and 
  outside the United States;                                                    

• approximately $11.0 million to fund research and development programs         
  dedicated to development of new diagnostic tests in the field of immunology;  

• approximately $6.0 million to repay indebtedness outstanding under our senior 
  secured term debt facility and related accrued interest; and                  

• approximately $11.9 million for working capital and other general corporate   
  purposes.                                                                     

As of September 30, 2013, we had $6.0 million outstanding under our senior
secured term debt. This indebtedness matures in May 2017 and bears an interest
rate equal to the greater of 2.75% above the prime rate or 6.0%. The use of
proceeds of such indebtedness was to repay prior indebtedness and for working
capital.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to opportunistically acquire,
license and invest in complementary products, technologies or businesses;
however, we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such
transaction.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds
to be received upon the closing of this offering. In addition, the amount,
allocation and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the revenue generated from the sale of our products and our
ability to satisfy ourselves that each investment is likely to have a good
return. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds.
Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments or other securities."

common stock in this offering of approximately $177 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares
of our common stock from the selling stockholders, we will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of any such shares.

We intend to retain approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds from this
offering for general corporate purposes. We intend to use the remaining
$172 million of net proceeds from this offering, together with net borrowings of
$169.5 million under our new term loan facility, to repay the Kellwood Note
Receivable, which will total $341.5 million.

Immediately prior to consummation of this offering, Vince Intermediate Holding, 
LLC will issue the Kellwood Note Receivable to Kellwood Company, LLC in 
connection with Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC’s acquisition of Vince, LLC. 
Proceeds from the repayment of the Kellwood Note Receivable will be used to (i) 
repay, discharge or repurchase certain indebtedness of Kellwood Company, LLC and
(ii) pay (A) the restructuring fee payable to Sun Capital Management and (B) the 
debt recovery bonus payable to our Chief Executive Officer, all after giving 
effect to the Additional Sun Capital Contribution. The Kellwood Note Receivable 
will not include amounts outstanding under the Wells Fargo Facility. Kellwood
will refinance the Wells Fargo Facility in connection with the consummation of
this offering. Neither Apparel Holding Corp. nor Vince, LLC will guarantee or be
a borrower party to the refinanced credit facility. It will not bear interest
and will be due the date of its issuance. Vince Holding Corp. will contribute
all of the net proceeds from this offering to Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC
immediately after the consummation of this offering. Vince Intermediate Holding,
LLC will use such proceeds (less $5 million which will be retained for general
corporate purposes) and approximately $169.5 million of net borrowings under its
new term loan facility to immediately repay the Kellwood Note Receivable. There
will be no outstanding balance on the Kellwood Note Receivable after giving
effect to such repayment.

As described in the table below, Kellwood Company, LLC will use the proceeds
from the repayment of the Kellwood Note Receivable to, after giving effect to
the Additional Sun Capital Contribution, (i) repay, at closing, all indebtedness
outstanding under (A) the Cerberus Term Loan, which had an outstanding balance
of $45.7 million as of August 3, 2013 and (B) the Sun Term Loan Agreements,
which collectively totaled $118.0 million in the aggregate as of August 3, 2013,
(ii) redeem at par all of the outstanding 12.875% Notes, which totaled $146.8
million as of August 3, 2013, pursuant to an unconditional redemption notice to
be issued at the closing of this offering, plus, with respect to clauses (i) and
(ii), fees, expenses and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, (iii) pay a
restructuring fee equal to the aggregate of 1% of the offering and certain
related debt repayment and the amount of the new Vince and Kellwood credit
facilities to Sun Capital Management pursuant to the Management Services
Agreement and (iv) pay a debt recovery bonus of $6.0 million to our Chief
Executive Officer. The restructuring fee described in clause (iii) above and
payable to Sun Capital Management in connection with this offering will total
$3.3 million.

In addition, Kellwood Company will conduct a tender offer for all of its
outstanding 7.625% Notes, which totaled $87.0 million in aggregate principal
amount as of August 3, 2013, at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
using proceeds from the repayment of the Kellwood Note Receivable. The tender
offer will close at or after the closing of this offering. Kellwood Company, LLC
may also, at or after the closing of this offering, use proceeds remaining from
the repayment of the Kellwood Note Receivable to discharge or repurchase at par
all or any of its 3.5% Convertible Notes, which totaled $0.2 million in 
aggregate principal amount as of August 3, 2013, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest thereon. Neither Apparel Holding Corp. nor Vince, LLC is a guarantor or 
obligor of either the 7.625% Notes or the 3.5% Convertible Notes.

If the tender offer for the 7.625% Notes is not completed contemporaneously with
the closing of this offering, Kellwood Company, LLC shall enter into an escrow
agreement with Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC and the Escrow Agent at the
closing of this offering, pursuant to which Kellwood Company, LLC will escrow an
amount necessary to purchase the 7.625% Notes which may be tendered in the
tender offer at the closing of the tender offer until the termination of the
related escrow agreement. If the tender offer is completed contemporaneously
with the consummation of this offering, we will not enter into the escrow
agreement. No interest will accrue on the funds placed into escrow with the
Escrow Agent and both Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC and Kellwood Company, LLC
must consent to any distributions from the escrow account in accordance with the
terms of the Transfer Agreement. The escrow agreement will automatically
terminate upon the earlier of (i) the closing of the tender offer for the 7.625%
Notes and (ii) the three-month anniversary of the closing of this offering.
Amounts in escrow shall be held for the benefit of Kellwood Company, LLC and not
for the benefit of any holders of the 7.625% Notes. Kellwood Company, LLC will
retain amounts remaining in the escrow account, if any, after consummation of
the tender offer.

The following table sets forth the uses from the repayment of the Kellwood Note
Receivable, which will total $341.5 million, after giving effect to the
estimated $70.1 million Additional Sun Capital Contribution. The final amount of
the Additional Sun Capital Contribution will be adjusted to fill any gap between
the amount of the Kellwood Note Receivable of $341.5 million and the amount of
all payments to be made and indebtedness to be repaid, repurchased or redeemed
at or after closing in connection with this offering (including all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and all fees and expenses related thereto).

         other general corporate purposes of the Company.                          

     o   12.875% Notes.  The 12.875% Notes are scheduled to mature on December 31,

consisting of (i) US$66.2 million from this offering after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us in connection with this offering and based upon the public
offering price of US$13.00 per ADS and (ii) US$15.0 million from the concurrent
private placement to Sequoia.

We anticipate using the net proceeds of this offering for the following
purposes:

• approximately US$20 million for sales and marketing initiatives including  
  advertising;                                                               

• approximately US$10 million for research and development;

• approximately US$5 million for continuing investment in our technology     
  platform; and                                                              

• the balance for other general corporate purposes, including working capital
  needs, incremental costs associated with being a public company, and       
  potential acquisitions (although we are not currently negotiating any such 
  acquisitions).                                                             

In addition, the purposes of this offering also include the retention of
employees by providing them with equity incentives and the creation of a public
market for our ordinary shares represented by the ADSs for the benefit of our
shareholders.

The foregoing represents our intentions as of the date of this prospectus with
respect to the use and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering and the
concurrent private placement to Sequoia based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds of the offering and the concurrent
private placement to Sequoia. The occurrence of unforeseen events or changed
business conditions may result in application of the proceeds of this offering
and the concurrent private placement to Sequoia in a manner other than as
described in this prospectus.

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering and the
concurrent private placement to Sequoia are not immediately applied for the
above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing debt instruments or bank deposits. These investments may have a
material adverse effect on the United States federal income tax consequences of
your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a PFIC for United
States federal income tax purposes, which could result in negative tax
consequences for you.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement
to Sequoia, we, as an offshore holding company, are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiary through loans or capital
contributions and to our consolidated affiliated entities through loans. Subject
to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements,
we may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiary or our consolidated
affiliated entities or make additional capital contributions to our PRC
subsidiary to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

$72.7 million, due under our purchase obligations for the 2015 newbuildings and
the remainder for general corporate purposes, including if the newbuilding
option is exercised, to fund $17.6 million of the approximately $44.0 million
required to purchase the option newbuilding. We currently expect the remaining
$109.1 million and $26.4 million of the purchase prices for the 2015
newbuildings and option newbuilding, respectively, to be financed under future
credit facilities. The actual amount of the equity portion and debt portion
under our purchase obligations could be impacted by the availability of debt
financing on favorable terms.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling
shareholders. We have agreed to pay certain expenses incurred by the selling
shareholders related to this offering, which we estimate to be approximately
$250,000."

public offering price of $14.75 per ordinary share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

Proceeds are planned to be allocated to our different areas of activity as 
follows:

1. Seed Traits:

  a. Expedite time to market: we intend to invest in the implementation of our 
     computational platforms in order to shorten the development time for 
     particular traits, and ultimately the time to market.

  b. Extend and expand our seed trait project portfolio and technological 
     capabilities: we intend to expand our seed traits project portfolio into 
     new traits and new crops and thus increase the potential for significant 
     collaborations generating potentially significant revenues. In addition, 
     we intend to establish new validation and data generation capabilities, 
     primarily for biotic stress traits.

  c. Capture an additional share of the value chain by increasing self-funded 
     research and development: we intend to complement our revenue streams by 
     selectively self-funding a larger portion of our direct initial research 
     and development costs.

  d. Establishing technology infrastructure in new territories, in addition to 
     our existing infrastructure in Israel: we intend to diversify and broaden 
     our data generation activities, research capabilities and personnel in new 
     geographic sites.

We estimate the total investment in our seed traits operation will be 
approximately $33 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

2. Ag-Chemicals:

    Develop and expand our ag-chemical operations : We intend to establish 
    capabilities and facilities in order to be at the forefront of discovery 
    and innovation in ag-chemicals, such as herbicides and crop enhancers. This 
    includes investment in new computational discovery platforms, plant 
    validation systems and infrastructure for chemical screening and handling. 
    We estimate the total investment in our ag-chemical operations will be 
    approximately $19 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
    commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

3. Evofuel:

    Further develop and commercialize our Evofuel activities: We intend to 
    invest in up-scaling our field trial activities towards commercialization 
    of castor seeds, including establishment of seed production and marketing 
    capabilities. Under these efforts, we intend to pursue new territories and 
    markets. In addition, we intend to expand our research and development 
    relating to the next generation of castor seeds. We estimate the total 
    investment in our Evofuel operation will be approximately $15 million, 
    after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
    offering expenses payable by us.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to make acquisitions or 
investments in complementary companies or technologies, although we do not have 
any agreement or understanding with respect to any such acquisition or 
investment at this time. We will have broad discretion in the way that we use 
the net proceeds from this offering."

not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling 
stockholders, although we will bear the costs, other than the underwriting 
discount, associated with those sales.

capital. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the

term, interest bearing obligations, investment grade instruments, certificates

  patiromer;                                                             

. approximately $10.0 to $15.0 million for development costs to prepare and 
  submit our New Drug Application, or NDA, for patiromer, and to support our
  activities during the FDA’s review and approval process;                  

. approximately $5.0 to $10.0 million for pre-commercialization marketing   
  activities for patiromer; and                                             

. any remaining proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and
regulatory approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the
exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the
above purposes. As such, our management will retain discretion over the use of
the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures
will depend upon numerous factors, including: the timing of our ongoing Phase 1
onset-of-action trial for patiromer; the draw down of the $7.5 million tranche
pursuant to our term loan, if any; the timing of our NDA submission to the FDA;
and unforeseen delays or problems in the development of our manufacturing and
supply chain.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $108.7 million, or
$125.4 million if the underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase
additional shares, at the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, and
after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We currently anticipate that we will use between $45.0 million and $50.0 million
of the net proceeds received by us to expand and support our sales and marketing
infrastructure, including hiring additional sales, marketing and clinical
education personnel, between $12.0 million and $15.0 million to fund research
and development activities, including hiring technical personnel and purchasing
product components and supplies, and between $20.0 million and $25.0 million to
expand and support our manufacturing capabilities, including hiring operational
and quality control personnel. We expect that the balance will be used for
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including costs and
expenses associated with being a public company. Our expected use of the net
proceeds from this offering is based upon our present plans and business
condition. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty
all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the
completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the
uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual use of proceeds will
vary depending on numerous factors. As a result, management will retain broad 
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering, and 
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of the net proceeds.

Pending the use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in high-quality, short-term interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the 
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this 
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that
    offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts 
    will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. 

(3) The underwriters have agreed to reimburse us for a portion of our expenses 
    in this offering. Any amounts so reimbursed will be held outside the trust 
    account. The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions 
    equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our
    initial business combination, up to $5,250,000, which constitutes the 
    underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $6,037,500 if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase 
    price of the business or businesses with which our initial business 
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or 
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest 
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. 

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. 

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for 
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, approximately $150,000,000 (or approximately $172,500,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$5,250,000 (or up to $6,037,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed into a
U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in U.S.
government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$15,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.01% per year. Except with
respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us to pay our franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds
from this offering will not be released from the trust account until the earlier
of (a) the completion of our initial business combination or (b) the redemption
of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination
within 21 months from the closing of this offering (or 24 months, as
applicable), subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do
not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes,
will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes for 2013.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or 
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or 
their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance 
funds to, or invest in, us. 

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of (i) $10,000 per month for office space, utilities,
secretarial support and administrative services, and (ii) $15,000 per month as
reimbursement for a portion of the compensation paid to its personnel including
certain of our officers who work on our behalf. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of February 1,
2014 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 21 months following the closing of this
offering (or 24 months from the closing of this offering if we have executed a
letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial
business combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering but have
not completed the initial business combination within such 21-month period),
subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations 
(including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the 
proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public 
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which all of our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares in connection with the completion of
our initial business combination and our initial stockholders, other than our
independent directors, have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect
to any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering in
connection with the completion of our business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we
fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame.
However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

that we are offering will be approximately $163.6 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $189.8 million. We will not
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the
selling stockholder.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, create
a public market for our common stock, facilitate our future access to the public
equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential customers and
improve our competitive position. We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering to repay in full $31.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our
revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including working
capital and potential capital expenditures. Our revolving credit facility
carries, at our election, (1) a base interest rate of the greater of the Federal
Funds Rate plus 0.5% or one-month LIBOR plus 1%, or Prime, or (2) a LIBOR based
interest rate plus additional interest of up to 4.5% depending on our leverage
ratio. We are required to repay the outstanding balance of our revolving credit
facility when it expires in August 2016 or to prepay the outstanding balance if
certain ratios are not met. We drew down $21.0 million of proceeds from the
revolving credit facility to repay our previously outstanding term loan in full,
including the end-of-term fee, and drew down an additional $10.0 million for
general corporate purposes. In addition, one percent of the net proceeds will 
be used to fund the Chegg Foundation, a California nonprofit public benefit 
corporation formed by us to engage in charitable and education-related 
activities. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition 
of, or investment in, complementary companies, products, services, technologies 
or assets. However, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements 
to enter into any acquisitions or make any such investments. We do not have 
more specific plans for the net proceeds from this offering. 

We have not yet determined our anticipated expenditures and therefore cannot
estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above. The
amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash
generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the
rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have
significant discretion and flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this
offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of these net proceeds.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government. The goal with respect to the investment of these net proceeds
will be capital preservation and liquidity so that these funds are readily
available to fund our operations."

paid as of June 30, 2013 and are not deducted from the estimated net proceeds.
The proceeds will be divided among the Company and ESH REIT based on their
estimated valuations. The Company will use the majority of the proceeds it
receives to purchase Class A common stock of ESH REIT to maintain its ownership
of 55% of the outstanding common stock of ESH REIT. The Company will use any
remaining balance, which it estimates will be approximately $21.6 million, for
general corporate purposes. ESH REIT intends to use the net proceeds from this
offering and the sale of Class A common stock to the Company and cash on hand to
repay indebtedness under ESH REIT’s 2012 Mezzanine Loans and assumed mortgage
loan, as described below. Our management will have broad discretion over the
uses of the net proceeds in this offering.

ESH REIT intends to use the proceeds received by it from this offering to repay
approximately $230.2 million of its Mezzanine A Loan, $151.9 million of its
Mezzanine B Loan, $115.1 million of its Mezzanine C Loan and $5.6 million of its
assumed mortgage loan. As of June 30, 2013, the Mezzanine A Loan had a fixed
interest rate per annum of approximately 8.3%, a total balance of $500.0 million

Loan had a fixed interest rate per annum of approximately 9.6%, a total balance
of $330.0 million and a maturity date of December 1, 2019. As of June 30, 2013,
the Mezzanine C Loan had a fixed interest rate per annum of approximately 11.5%,
a total balance of $250.0 million and a maturity date of December 1, 2019. The
borrowings under the 2012 Mezzanine Loans which will be repaid originated in the
November 2012 refinancing of ESH REIT’s then existing 2010 Mezzanine Loans.
Interest on the assumed mortgage loan is payable monthly on the first day of the
calendar month at a rate equal to greater of the sum of the daily LIBOR plus
4.0% or 5.0%. As of June 30, 2013, the assumed mortgage loan had a total balance
of approximately $5.6 million and a maturity date of October 8, 2014. 

We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 4,237,500 
additional Shares solely to cover over-allotments. The Company will use the 
majority of the proceeds it receives from the issuance and sale of Shares 
pursuant to any exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional 
Shares to purchase Class A common stock of ESH REIT to maintain its ownership 
of 55% of the outstanding common stock of ESH REIT. The Company will use any 
remaining balance, which it estimates will be approximately $3.5 million if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full, for general corporate purposes. ESH
REIT intends to use the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of Shares 
pursuant to any exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional 
Shares and the sale of Class A common stock to the Company, which it estimates 
will be approximately $76.2 million, if exercised in full, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us, and the proceeds from the

holders of our common stock to permit us to list our common stock on the NASDAQ
Global Market. Obtaining a listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global

At the closing of this offering, we will enter into a new $850.0 million
revolving credit facility, under which we will borrow $323.4 million to fund an
additional $323.4 million cash distribution to EEP. The cash distributions to
EEP from the proceeds of this offering and the borrowing under our revolving
credit facility will be made in consideration of its contribution of assets to
us and to reimburse EEP for certain capital expenditures incurred with respect
to those assets. We are funding these distributions through a combination of net
proceeds from this offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility
in order to optimize our capital structure.

If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common
units from us, we expect to receive additional net proceeds of approximately
$46.8 million. The net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their

allow our employees who are not executive officers holding such awards to sell
shares of our common stock in the public market to satisfy their income tax
obligations related to the vesting and settlement of such awards. Based on the

refinance our outstanding indebtedness. 

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 900,000 additional common
units in full, the additional net proceeds would be approximately $15.9 million.
The net proceeds from any exercise of such option will be used to reduce amounts
outstanding under our amended and restated credit facility.

Affiliates of certain of our underwriters will be lenders under our amended and
restated credit facility and, as such, may receive a portion of the proceeds of
this offering if the underwriters exercise any portion of their option to
purchase additional common units."

$178.1 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated transaction
expenses payable by us). We expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds 
to finance our fleet modernization plan, including our proposed acquisition of 
Airbus, Boeing and ATR aircraft, and any remaining amounts for general corporate 
purposes. We also expect to finance our fleet modernization plan with a 
combination of cash generated from operations, bank loans, export credit agency 
financings, capital and operating leases and other forms of financing that may 
be attractive from time to time.

shares in this offering and the sale of 2,500,000 common shares in the 
concurrent private placement will be approximately $174.0 million, at the 
initial public offering price of $20.00 per share (the price set forth on the
front cover page of this prospectus) and after deducting estimated offering
expenses payable by us. This amount includes $50.0 million to be received from
the concurrent private placement to Montpelier Reinsurance Ltd. If the 
underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares, we 
estimate that we would receive additional net proceeds of $18.75 million, at 
the initial public offering price of $20.00 per share (the price set forth on 
the front cover page of this prospectus). Our share of the offering expenses 
is capped at $1 million, with the excess to be reimbursed by Montpelier. 
Montpelier will also reimburse us for the underwriting discounts in connection
with this offering and the exercise (if any) of the underwriters’ option to 
purchase additional shares. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with 
respect to shares that are sold to Montpelier Reinsurance Ltd. in the 
concurrent private placement.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes to implement our business strategy in accordance with our 
underwriting guidelines. In particular, we will use the net proceeds to 
provide, among other things, fully collateralized reinsurance and to engage in
hedging and investment activities. We expect to deploy most of the net proceeds
of this offering and the concurrent private placement during the nine-month 
period following the completion of this offering, and we will retain the 
remainder of the proceeds, which we expect will be sufficient to fund our 
ongoing operations for at least 15 months following the completion of this 
offering and, if necessary, to fund the quarterly dividend, if any, in whole or
in part, for the first quarter of 2014. We anticipate being able to identify a
sufficient number of reinsurance opportunities to enable us to deploy most of 
our capital on favorable terms during the nine-month period following the 
completion of this offering, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to
do so. We do not currently have any indebtedness and do not expect to use any
net proceeds from this offering to repay any indebtedness."

underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$205.8 million (or $237.3 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full).

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering as follows:

. (i) first, to make a distribution to all 140 holders of our 12% Senior
  Cumulative Preferred Stock (including LGP and 130 of our current and former
  employees), which will reduce the liquidation preference of such shares
  until such liquidation preference is reduced to $1,000.00 per share and
  (ii) second, to pay the remainder as a distribution to all 140 holders of
  our 12% Junior Cumulative Preferred Stock (including LGP and 130 of our
  current and former employees), which will reduce the liquidation preference
  of such shares; and

. if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares, we
  intend to use the net proceeds that we receive to repay a portion of the
  outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.

The holders of our preferred stock are entitled to a preferential payment upon
certain distributions by us to holders of our capital stock (referred to as the
liquidation preference), equal to the purchase price for such share ($1,000.00)
plus accrued and unpaid dividends from August 16, 2007, on the outstanding
liquidation preference at a rate of 12% per annum, compounded quarterly. The
primary purpose of the distributions described above is to reduce the
liquidation preference of the preferred stock in advance of the Exchange. The
primary purpose of the Exchange is to retire the preferred stock such that we
will have only one class of capital stock outstanding—the common stock—following
the closing of this offering.

As of August 31, 2013, $361.3 million was outstanding under the Senior Secured
Term Loan Facility. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility had a
weighted average interest rate of 6.42% for fiscal 2012. The Senior Secured Term
Loan Facility accrues interest at the rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) + 4.25%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.25%, and matures on April 6,
2019. On April 8, 2013, The Container Store, Inc. entered into the Increase and
Repricing Transactions, which were effected pursuant to an amendment to the
Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. The additional $90.0 million of borrowings
was used to finance a distribution to holders of our senior preferred stock in
the amount of $90.0 million, which was paid on April 9, 2013."

investment by Jaguarundi in our Class B ordinary shares of approximately 
US$154.9 million if the over-allotment option is not exercised, and US$175.8 
million if the over-allotment option is exercised, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We anticipate using the net proceeds of this offering for the following 
purposes.

. approximately 30%, or US$46.5 million to invest in technology, infrastructure 
  and product development efforts;

. approximately 20%, or US$31.0 million to expand our sales and marketing 
  efforts; and

. the remaining amount to general corporate purposes, including working capital 
  needs and potential acquisitions (although we are not currently negotiating 
  any such acquisitions).

We do not currently have any agreements or understandings to make any material 
acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses.

In utilizing the proceeds we expect to receive from this offering, we, as an 
offshore holding company, are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to 
provide funding to our WFOE through capital contributions or loans, subject to 
approvals from or registrations with relevant PRC government authorities. If we 
were to increase the registered capital of our WFOE , we need to receive 
approval from MOFCOM or its local counterparts, which will decide whether or 
not to grant such approval within 90 days after receiving the application 
documents. If we were to provide funding to our WFOE through loans, the total 
amount of such loans may not exceed the difference between the WFOE’s total 
investment amount as approved by the foreign investment authorities and the 
WFOE’s registered capital. Such loans must also be registered with the SAFE, 
which registration usually takes no more than 20 working days to complete. The 
cost for obtaining such approvals and completing such registration is minimal. 
We currently expect that a substantial portion of the proceeds of this offering 
will be used by our WFOE in connection with its business expansion, such as 
data acquisition costs, bandwidth and server hosting costs, product development 
expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and other general and administrative 
expenses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete these government
registrations or obtain the relevant approvals on a timely basis, if at all.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and 
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans 
and business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility 
and discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The occurrence of 
unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of 
the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this 
prospectus."

$350.1 million.

Our principal reason for the offering is to raise equity capital that we intend
to use primarily to retire outstanding indebtedness, including possibly our 
8.75% Senior Fixed Rate Notes, which mature on June 1, 2019. Any net proceeds 
that we do not apply to reduce outstanding indebtedness will be used for 
general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures. However, we have
not made a definitive determination as to how to allocate these proceeds among
these and other possible general corporate purposes and we do not anticipate
doing so prior to the completion of the offering."

(1)    A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
       FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
       portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we        
       received from Cambridge Capital LLC described below. These funds will be     
       repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.                 

(2)    No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the 
       private units.                                                               
 
(3)    The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will equal $450,000, or 
       $800,000 if the over-allotment is exercised in full. In addition, interest   
       income earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of     
       taxes owed on such interest income) will be available to us to pay for our   
       working capital requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust   
       account will be approximately $100,000 over a 24-month period assuming an    
       interest rate of approximately 0.1% per year.                                

(4)    These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
       these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we  
       may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
       connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
       based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not   
       anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
       fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
       fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
       category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     

Our sponsors and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or their designees) have committed that
they and/or their designees will purchase the private units (for an aggregate
purchase price of $4,275,000) from us on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Our sponsors and
EarlyBirdCapital have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised
by the underwriters, they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 44,625 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least
$10.10 per share of common stock sold to the public in this offering is held in
trust if the over-allotment option is exercised in full. All of the proceeds we
receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.

$71,050,000, or $81,305,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at UBS Financial Services Inc.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds
held in the trust account will be invested only in United States government
treasury bills, notes or bonds having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S.
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (1) interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other
tax obligations and (2) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
that may be released to us for our working capital requirements, the proceeds
will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion
of our initial business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding
public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required
time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Cambridge Capital LLC, an affiliate of Benjamin Gordon, of a
monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being
agreed to by Cambridge Capital LLC for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Mr. Gordon with compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in West Palm Beach, Florida, that the fee
charged by Cambridge Capital LLC is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees or other
similar compensation) will be paid to our sponsors, members of our management
team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine
their operations. Since the role of present management after our initial
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.
 
Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $450,000, or $800,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (after
payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be released to us to fund our
working capital requirements in searching for our initial business combination.
We intend to use the after-tax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such
as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our sponsors, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to
EarlyBirdCapital in an amount equal to 3.0% of the total gross proceeds raised
in the offering upon consummation of our initial business combination for acting
as our investment banker on a non-exclusive basis to assist us in structuring
and negotiating a business combination (but not for the purpose of identifying a
target business). To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in
part as consideration to effect our initial business combination, the proceeds
held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our executive officers have agreed to pay the
funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no
more than $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of October 8, 2013, Cambridge Capital LLC loaned to us an aggregate of
$100,000 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced
in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the
non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and
audit fees and expenses. The loan is payable without interest on the earlier of
(i) October 2, 2014, (ii) the date on which we consummate our initial public
offering or (iii) the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial
public offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our sponsors, officers and directors or their affiliates may,
but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the 
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon 
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a 
price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the 
units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the
holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial 
business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination, 
the loans will not be repaid.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (1) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period or (2) if that public
stockholder elects to convert shares of common stock in connection with a
stockholder vote to approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote
to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account."

We intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering and
available cash to repay approximately $1,250 million of term loan borrowings
outstanding under our new senior secured credit facilities. As of November 8,
2013, we had $7.5 billion of term loan borrowings outstanding under our senior
secured credit facilities which will mature on October 25, 2020. The currently
outstanding term loan borrowings were used, together with other borrowings and
cash on hand, to repay in full all $13.4 billion of our legacy senior mortgage
loans and secured mezzanine loans. See “Summary—Refinancing Transactions.” The
term loan borrowings bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to a margin
over either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the
administrative agent’s prime lending rate, (2) the federal funds effective rate
plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%
or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the Reuters LIBOR rate for the
interest period relevant to such borrowing. The margin for the term loans is
2.00%, in the case of base rate loans, and 3.00%, in the case of LIBOR rate
loans, subject to one step-down of 0.25% upon the achievement of a first lien
net leverage ratio of less than or equal to 3.85 to 1.00 and subject to an
additional step-down of 0.25% following a qualifying initial public offering,
subject to a base rate floor of 2.00%, and a LIBOR floor of 1.00%. See
“Description of Certain Indebtedness.” To the extent we raise more proceeds in
this offering than currently estimated, we will repay additional term loans
borrowings or use such proceeds for other general corporate purposes. To the
extent we raise less proceeds in this offering than currently estimated, we will
reduce the amount of term loans borrowings that will be repaid. Affiliates of
certain of the underwriters currently serve as lenders and/or agents under our
term loan borrowings and would be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of

consideration of an interest rate swap, was 2.62% as of September 30, 2013. As 
of September 30, 2013, the outstanding balance of the CoBank loan was 
approximately $132.4 million, all of which was outstanding under the CoBank term 
loan. On August 11, 2018, all outstanding principal, interest and any fees or 
other obligations on the CoBank loan will be due and payable in full. We used

eurocurrency (LIBOR) term loan borrowings and 2.50% for base rate term loan
borrowings. The term loans maturing in September 2019 have applicable margins of
3.00% for eurocurrency (LIBOR) term loan borrowings, subject to a LIBOR floor of
1.00%, and 2.00% for base-rate borrowings, subject to minimum base rate of
2.00%. 

We also intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering to
repay approximately $150.0 million of outstanding borrowing under the revolving
credit facilities constituting part of our senior secured credit facilities. As
of November 22, 2013, we had a total of $283.7 million in outstanding revolving
credit facility borrowings. U.S. dollar borrowings under the revolving credit
facilities have an applicable margin of 3.25% for eurocurrency (LIBOR)
borrowings and 2.25% for base-rate borrowings and an unused commitment fee of
0.50% per annum. Canadian dollar borrowings have an applicable margin of 3.25%
for BA (bankers’ acceptance) rate borrowings and 2.25% for base-rate borrowings
and an unused commitment fee of 0.50% per annum.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our senior secured
credit agreement and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering through repayment of such indebtedness."

approximately US$116.9 million, or approximately US$135.5 million if the
representatives of the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
ADSs in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, to retain talented employees by
providing liquidity to their equity incentives and to obtain additional capital.
We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

. approximately US$25.0 million for investing in our technology and product 
  development; 

. approximately US$25.0 million for expanding our sales and marketing 
  activities; 

. US$37.5 million for the remaining portion of the share repurchase 
  consideration payable by us in the West Crest Share Purchase. The sole 
  shareholder of West Crest Limited is Mr. Jiang Lan, a former director of our 
  company; and 

. the balance for general corporate purposes, including expenditures relating 
  to the expansion of our operations. 
 
The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we are
permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to our VIEs only
through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and
approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiary
or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to fund its
capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if
at all. In addition, as we have obtained U.S. dollar financing from a third-
party lender to pay the first installment in the West Crest Share Purchase and 
pledged the approximate corresponding amount of our existing RMB cash balance 
to the lender as collateral, we may also consider using part of the proceeds 
from this offering to repay the U.S. dollar loan so that the pledged RMB cash 
balance can be released for use in our operations."

of common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting underwriting
discounts, the structuring fee and estimated offering expenses. Our estimate
assumes the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units from us is
not exercised. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to pay
revolving credit facility issuance costs of approximately $1.7 million, and we
will retain the remainder of the net proceeds of this offering for general
partnership purposes, which may include funding potential future acquisitions
from Valero and third parties and potential future organic expansion capital
expenditures.

We expect to use the majority of the retained net proceeds from this offering
for potential future acquisitions, such as the potential acquisition from Valero
of our right of first offer assets. However, the consummation and timing of any
future acquisition of our right of first offer assets are subject to various
contingencies, including Valero’s willingness to offer such assets for sale and
its willingness to accept any offer we may choose to make. We may also consider
the acquisition of other assets from Valero and third parties. Any such 
acquisitions, however, will also depend on various contingencies, including 
our ability to identify attractive acquisition candidates and successfully 
negotiate acceptable purchase agreements.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase up to an
additional 2,250,000 common units, the number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the
remainder of the 2,250,000 additional common units, if any, will be issued to
Valero. Any such common units issued to Valero will be issued for no additional
consideration. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional common units from us, the additional net proceeds would be
approximately $48.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and the
structuring fee. We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units from us for general
partnership purposes, which may include funding potential future acquisitions
from Valero and third parties and potential future organic expansion capital
expenditures."

underwriting discounts and commissions, and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us, will be approximately $7.7 million (or approximately $9.4 million
if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including the development and introduction of new software offerings
and the expansion of our marketing efforts, which may include the addition of
new direct sales and service employees.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds. The occurrence of unforeseen events or
changed business conditions could result in the application of the net proceeds
of this offering in a manner other than as described above. Pending our use of
the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term bank deposits or interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."
XENCOR INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/xencor-inc-673726-73719,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/xencor-inc-673726-73719,424B4,12/3/2013,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=9641578,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $62.6 million
(or approximately $72.4 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in
this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

. approximately $19.3 million to fund the continued clinical development of 
  XmAb5871 through a planned Phase 2b clinical trial; 

. approximately $21.7 million to fund initial clinical development of XmAb7195 
  through a planned Phase 1b clinical trial; 

. approximately $15.8 million to fund product candidate discovery, technology 
  development and patent prosecution activities; and 

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, 
  including the additional costs associated with being a public company. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
in-license, acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies,
products or assets. However we have no current plan, commitments or obligations
to do so.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
and cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund
our operations through 2016. Even with the expected net proceeds from this
offering, we do not expect to have sufficient cash to complete the clinical
development of any of our product candidates or, if applicable, to prepare for
commercializing any product candidate that is approved.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the progress,
cost and results of our preclinical and clinical development programs, and
whether we are able to enter into future product development partnerships and
technology license arrangements. As a result, our management will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying
on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."
