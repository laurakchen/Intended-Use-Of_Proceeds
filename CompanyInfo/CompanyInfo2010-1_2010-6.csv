from this offering, or US$90.0 million if the underwriters exercise their 
option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting the estimated 
underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes: 

• approximately US$40 million to fund the development of our company-owned 
  brokerage services business to enter new cities through selected strategic
  acquisitions to enter new cities; 

• approximately US$20 million to fund the development of our company-owned
  brokerage services business in existing cities by opening additional
  company-owned sales offices; 
 
• approximately US$10 million to invest and upgrade our information and
  operations systems; 
 
• the balance to fund general corporate purposes, including our working
  capital needs.

particular uses for all of the net proceeds we will receive upon the 
completion of this offering. The foregoing represents our current intentions 
with respect to the use and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering

management will have significant discretion in applying the net proceeds we 
will receive from the offering. The occurrence of unforeseen events or 
changed business conditions could result in application of the net proceeds 
of this offering in a manner other than as described in this prospectus. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we believe that the estimated net 
proceeds of this offering, along with existing cash balances and ongoing 
operating cash flows, will provide necessary capital for our contemplated 
expansion plans. Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net 
proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations."
CHINA HYDROELECTRIC CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/china-hydroelectric-corp-817076-62817,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/china-hydroelectric-corp-817076-62817,424B4,1/26/2010,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7003146,"We expect that the net proceeds we will receive from the sale of the units 
offered by us will be approximately $62.7 million, based on an assumed initial 
public offering price of $16 per unit and after deducting the estimated 
underwriting discount, the non-accountable expense allowance and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to 
purchase up to 750,000 additional units from us in full, our net proceeds will 
be approximately $73.9 million after deducting the estimated underwriting 
discount and estimated offering expenses. The non-accountable expense 
allowance of 1% of the gross proceeds of this offering will not be paid on any 
units that the underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to their over-allotment 
option. A $1 increase/(decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price 
of $16 per unit would increase/(decrease) the net proceeds to us from this 
offering by approximately $2.9 million, or approximately $3.3 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase up to 750,000 additional units 
from us in full, assuming the number of units offered by us, as set forth on 
the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting the 
estimated underwriting discount, the non-accountable expense allowance (which 
does not apply to the additional 750,000 additional units) and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. 
  
The primary purposes of this offering are to gain access to the broader 
capital markets to assist our future business development, to create a public 
market for our ordinary shares for the benefit of all shareholders, to retain 
talented employees by providing them with equity incentives and to obtain 
additional capital. We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering to 
acquire hydroelectric power companies and assets and for the development of 
new hydropower plants in China, for working capital and for general corporate
purposes. We do not currently have more specific plans to acquire any 
particular hydropower plant using the net proceeds from this offering and have 
not entered into any agreement with respect to any such potential acquisition.
  
We have not yet determined all of our expected expenditures, and we cannot 
estimate the amounts to be used for the purposes set forth above. The amounts 
and timing of any expenditures will depend on the availability of acquisition 
opportunities on terms acceptable to us. Accordingly, our management will have 
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. 
  
Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade securities or bank deposits. These investments may have a 
material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your 
investment in our units. It is possible that we may become a passive foreign 
investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could result in 
adverse tax consequences for you.
  
In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we 
are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our 
existing and any future PRC subsidiaries and investee companies through 
capital contributions or loans subject to satisfaction of applicable 
government registration and approval requirements. We may not be able to 
obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, or at 
all."

pursuant to this prospectus, after deducting the full underwriting discount 
(as described below), and estimated offering costs and expenses, will be 
approximately $138.5 million. If the underwriters’ overallotment is exercised 
in full, our net proceeds from the offering will be approximately 
$159.7 million. 

All of the shares sold in this offering will be sold to the underwriters at 
$  per share, representing an initial discount to the underwriters of $   per 
share. We have agreed to pay the underwriters an additional $   per share, 
with respect to all shares sold in this offering when the capital deployment 
hurdle (as described herein) is satisfied. The capital deployment hurdle 
numerator is the cumulative acquisition of hotel properties, net of cash 
acquired (or substantially similar financial measures), that we will report in 
our statements of cash flows for all periods following the offering. The
capital deployment hurdle denominator is net proceeds received from the 
offering and the concurrent private placements (including net proceeds 
received from any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option, but 
excluding any deferred underwriting compensation). The capital deployment 
hurdle is satisfied when the capital deployment hurdle numerator divided by 
the capital deployment hurdle denominator is greater than 50%.

If we meet the capital deployment hurdle described above, we will pay the 
underwriters an additional underwriting discount equal to $      million in 
the aggregate (or $      million if the underwriters exercise their
overallotment option in full). In such case, our total net proceeds from this 
offering would be approximately $      million (or, if the underwriters 
exercise their overallotment option in full, approximately $       million), 
after deducting the initial underwriting discount, the additional underwriting 
discount and estimated offering expenses. The additional underwriting discount 
is payable within five business days following our filing of a quarterly or 
annual report after the capital deployment hurdle is satisfied. 

Concurrently with the offering, in separate private placements, we will sell 
(1) up to 4.9% of the common shares to be outstanding following the offering, 
but in no event more than $20 million of our common shares, to Hyatt, and (2) 
up to 9.8% of the common shares to be outstanding following the offering, but 
in no event more than $25 million of our common shares, to Baron, in each 
case, excluding common shares that may be sold pursuant to the underwriters’ 
overallotment option, and at the IPO price per share, less the greater of the 
underwriting discount or 6%. We also will sell an aggregate of 150,000 common 
shares to our non-executive chairman, our president and chief executive 
officer and our executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
and secretary at the IPO price per share. We will receive net proceeds of 
approximately $28.5 million from the concurrent private placements, or 
approximately $32.3 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment 
option in full prior to the closing of this offering. 

We will contribute the net proceeds of the offering and the concurrent private 
placements to our operating partnership. Our operating partnership intends to 
subsequently use the net proceeds received from us as follows: 

• approximately $250,000 to repay Messrs. Francis and Vicari for loans and 
  accrued interest which funded our operating costs and certain costs of the
  offering, and to repurchase the shares acquired by them in connection with
  our initial capitalization representing an aggregate of $1,000; and 

• the remaining proceeds to fund investments in hotel properties in up to six
  months after the completion of the offering and to cover our working capital
  needs in a manner consistent with our investment strategy. 
 
The value of the units that we will receive in exchange for our contribution 
of the net proceeds to the operating partnership will increase or decrease if 
our common share price increases or decreases. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing, 
short-term investment grade securities or money-market accounts which are 
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. Such investments may
include, for example, government and government agency certificates, 
certificates of deposit, interest-bearing bank deposits and mortgage loan 
participations. These investments are expected to provide a lower net return 
than we will seek to achieve from our target properties."

existing indebtedness (including paying any redemption or repurchase premiums 
or related pre-payment penalties), including potentially, but not limited to, 
redeeming or repurchasing a portion of our outstanding senior secured notes 
or repaying our $6.3 million promissory note issued in the APF Acquisition. 

In June 2009, we issued $255 million in aggregate principal amount of our 
senior secured notes and used the proceeds of this issuance to redeem all of 
our 9  3 / 4 % senior secured notes due 2010, which we refer to in this
prospectus as the 2010 Notes, and to fund an earnout payment made on August 
28, 2009 in conjunction with the 2006 Merger. This redemption was completed 
in July 2009. The senior secured notes mature on June 1, 2014, pay interest 
in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year (commencing on December 1, 
2009) at the rate of 11  1 / 2 % and have an effective interest rate of 
12.48%. 

In connection with the APF Acquisition in July 2008, we issued a promissory 
note in the principal amount of $6.3 million, which bears interest at 12% per 
year and is payable in quarterly installments with the principal due on 
July 2, 2011."

We intend to use $114.2 million of the net proceeds from this offering to 
purchase 16,666,667 newly-issued limited partnerships units from Graham 
Packaging Holdings Company. These proceeds will be contributed to the 
Operating Company which intends to use the proceeds for repayment of a portion

a floor of 2.5%) plus 4.25% (6.75% at September 30, 2009). On a pro forma 
basis, after giving effect to the use of the net proceeds of this offering for 
the repayment of a portion of our term loans, the outstanding amounts of term 
loans B and C would be $592.3 million and $1,079.7 million, respectively. 

The remaining proceeds will be used to make a one-time monitoring fee payment 
of $26.3 million to Blackstone and $8.8 million to the Graham Family in 
connection with the termination of our Monitoring Agreement and to reimburse 
Blackstone for paying on our behalf historical administrative expenses 
incurred by us in the amount of $0.8 million.

We currently intend to use our net proceeds from this offering for working 
capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds to repay debt, including our credit facility,
or acquire other businesses, products or technologies. 
  
The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts 
we actually expend in these areas may vary significantly from our current 
intentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including future sales 
growth, success of our engineering efforts, cash generated from future 
operations, if any, and actual expenses to operate our business. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular 
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering. 
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of 
the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our 
management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. 
  
The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several factors, 
including the amount and timing of our spending on sales and marketing 
activities and research and development activities, as well as our use of cash 
for other corporate activities. Pending the uses described above, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation instruments,

$162.8 million after deducting the full underwriting discount and other 
estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters’ option to purchase 
additional shares in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our 
net proceeds will be approximately $187.5 million. 

The underwriters will forego the receipt of payment of $0.80 per share, until 
such time as we purchase assets in accordance with our investment strategy as
described in this prospectus with an aggregate purchase price (including the
amount of any outstanding indebtedness assumed or incurred by us) at least 
equal to the net proceeds from this offering (after deducting the full 
underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses payable by us), 
at which time, we have agreed to pay the underwriters an amount equal to $0.80 
per share sold in this offering. 

Concurrently with the completion of this offering, we will sell an aggregate
of 350,000 shares of our common stock (representing 3.8% of the shares of our 
common stock issued in this offering and the concurrent private placement) 
to Mr. Baird and Mr. Coke in a private placement at the same price per share
as in this offering but without payment of any underwriting discount. 
We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $7.0 million 
from the concurrent private placement. 

We will invest the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private 
placement in industrial properties in accordance with our investment strategy
described in this prospectus and for general business purposes. We expect this 
investment in industrial properties to be completed within six to twelve
months after the completion of this offering. Prior to the full investment of 
the net offering proceeds in industrial properties, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in interest-bearing short-term U.S. government and government
agency securities, which are consistent with our intention to qualify as a 
REIT. These initial investments are expected to provide a lower net return 
than we will seek to achieve from investments in industrial properties. 
We will use approximately $265,000 of the net proceeds to reimburse Terreno 
Capital Partners LLC for out-of-pocket expenses it incurred in connection with
the formation of our company and this offering and $1,000 to repurchase the
shares Mr. Baird and Mr. Coke acquired in connection with the formation and 
initial capitalization of our company."

We intend to use the net proceeds received from this offering for general 
corporate and working capital purposes, including capital expenditures 
related to renewal of leases and re-letting of space, the acquisition and 
development of (and/or investment in) office properties, or, if market

proceeds received from this offering, we may use such proceeds to invest in 
highly liquid short-term securities and/or temporarily repay amounts 
outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2009, 
the aggregate principal amount outstanding under our revolving credit 
facility, which matures in August 2011, was $130 million, and such facility 
carried interest at a rate equal to the weighted-average interest rate on all 
outstanding draws as of September 30, 2009. We may select from multiple 
interest rate options with each draw, including the prime rate and various 
length LIBOR locks. All selections are subject to an additional spread 
(0.475% as of September 30, 2009) over the selected rate based on our current
credit rating. As of September 30, 2009, the interest rate on our revolving 
credit facility was 1.52%. 

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our revolving 
credit facility. As such, to the extent that we use a portion of the net

discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working 
capital to fund anticipated operating expenses, establish a public market for 
our Class A common stock and facilitate future access to the public markets. 

We estimate that we will use the proceeds of this offering, in combination 
with existing cash resources of approximately $123.1 million as of December 
31, 2009, as follows: 

• approximately $225.0 million to fund the development and commercialization
  of linaclotide; 

• approximately $39.0 million to fund the research and development of IW-6118,
  an inhibitor of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase, or FAAH, being evaluated for the
  treatment of pain and inflammation, in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, and to
  continue discovery and preclinical research of early-stage compounds in
  gastrointestinal pain, inflammation and cardiovascular indications during
  the twelve month period following the date of this offering; and 

• the remainder for general corporate purposes, such as general and 
  administrative expenses, capital expenditures, working capital, prosecution
  and maintenance of our intellectual property, the potential investment in
  technologies or products that complement our business, and further
  investments in our pipeline. 

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this 
offering as described above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation 
of funds may be necessary. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures 
will depend upon numerous factors, including the progress of our development 
and commercialization efforts of linaclotide, the progress of our clinical 
studies, our existing and future strategic collaborations and partnerships and
our operating costs and expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have 
significant flexibility in the expenditure of the net proceeds of this 
offering. 

The costs and timing of drug development and commercialization and of 
regulatory approval, particularly conducting clinical studies, are highly 
uncertain, are subject to substantial risks and can often change. Accordingly, 
we may change the allocation of use of these proceeds as a result of 
contingencies such as the progress and results of our clinical studies and 
other development activities, the continuation of our existing collaborations 
and the establishment of new arrangements, our manufacturing requirements and 
regulatory or competitive developments.

otherwise, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term

from the 8,225,000 shares of common stock that we are offering based upon the 
initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. We will also receive proceeds of approximately $1.8 million from the 
exercise of stock options by certain selling stockholders in connection with 
this offering. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in 
full, we estimate our net proceeds from this offering will be approximately 
$134.8 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of 
common stock offered by the selling stockholders, except for the aggregate 
exercise price of the selling stockholder options, as noted above. 
  
We intend to use: 
  
• a majority of our net proceeds from this offering to redeem up to $71.75 
  million in principal amount of our outstanding 11 3 / 4 % senior 
  subordinated notes due 2013, at a redemption price of 105.875% of the
  principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest; and  
   
• the balance of our net proceeds from this offering for working capital and
  other general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions.  

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions of complementary companies, products or 
technologies. While we have no agreements or commitments for any specific 
acquisitions at this time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these 
purposes. 
  
We have not yet determined the amount of notes we will redeem with a portion
of our net proceeds from this offering. The amount we redeem will depend on 
the amount of our proceeds from this offering, our anticipated cash resources
and needs and other factors we consider relevant. We may not redeem more than
35% of the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding without a waiver 
from the lenders under our senior credit facilities. If we redeem 35% of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes, we will redeem $71.75 million in 
principal amount of notes for $76.0 million in cash, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest. This redemption will result in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 
approximately $5.5 million in the period in which the notes are redeemed, 
which includes a $4.2 million redemption premium and a non-cash charge of 
approximately $1.3 million relating to the write-off of deferred financing 
fees attributable to the redeemed notes. For each $1.0 million decrease in 
the principal amount redeemed, we will pay $1.06 million less in cash to 
redeem the notes. 
  
We have not yet determined with any certainty the manner in which we will 
allocate the balance of our net proceeds from this offering, and as a result 
management will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net 
proceeds. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will vary depending on 
a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated by our operations,
potential acquisitions, competitive developments and the rate of growth, if 
any, of our business. For example, if we were to expand our operations more 
rapidly than anticipated by our current plans, a greater portion of the net 
proceeds would likely be used for working capital. Alternatively, if we were 
to engage in an acquisition that contained a significant cash component, some
or all of the net proceeds in excess of the amount required to redeem the 
notes might be used for that purpose. 
  
Pending any use, as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

based on an initial public offering price of $13.00 per share, from the
issuance of new common shares in this offering, after deducting underwriting

Our intention is to use these proceeds first to fully repay the debt 
outstanding under our 2005 Credit Facility. Our 2005 Credit Facility, as of 
March 24, 2010 has debt outstanding of $38.9 million, has an interest rate 
of 0.70% above LIBOR, and is scheduled to mature on May 18, 2015. The proceeds
of this indebtedness were used to acquire the Senatore and Noemi. 

We intend to use the remainder of our net offering proceeds, after repayment 
of our 2005 Credit Facility, of $110.7 million, and after assessing any 
working capital and other general corporate expense needs, to pursue vessel 
acquisitions consistent with our strategy, including the purchase of 
additional modern tankers ranging in size from approximately 35,000 dwt, to 
approximately 200,000 dwt and that generally are not more than five years old.
We believe that our strong balance sheet, financing capacity and future access
to capital will allow us to make opportunistic vessel acquisitions at 
attractive prices. We may purchase secondhand vessels that meet our 
specifications or newbuilding vessels, either directly from shipyards or 
from the current owners. The timing of these acquisitions will depend on our 
ability to identify suitable vessels on attractive purchase terms but we 
intend to acquire vessels within 12 months of this offering. 

Although we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring vessels 
at prices comparable to current market prices, we could use the proceeds of 
this offering available for vessel acquisitions, per the above description 
and based upon current market conditions, to purchase up to four new Handysize
tankers, two new Panamax tankers, or one new Aframax tanker, not including 
any borrowings under the new credit facility, and not accounting for any 
drydocking expenses. These estimates are based on the newbuilding purchase 
price estimates. As noted, we may also purchase secondhand vessels that meet 
our specifications at prices to be determined by market conditions, which are
affected by the age of the vessel. No assets will be acquired from our 
affiliates. 

We have also obtained a commitment letter for a new $150,000,000 senior 
secured credit facility that we expect to enter into after the closing of 
this offering. Any borrowings under this credit facility are intended to 
facilitate future vessel acquisitions."

approximately $10.3 million, or $12.0 million if the underwriters exercise

The principal purposes for this offering are to fund our development 
activities, including clinical trials for our most advanced product 
candidates, CRMD003 and CRMD001, and pre-clinical development of our other 
product candidates, CRMD004 and CRMD002, to increase our working capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock, to increase our ability to access 
the capital markets in the future, for general corporate purposes and to

   following:  
 
º  development of the final formulation for clinical trial use;  
 
º  FDA regulatory filing costs;  
 
º  pivotal clinical trial development costs;  
 
º  patent maintenance fees;

   technologies, products or businesses.  

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our intentions

progress of our clinical trials and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, we 
will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of the remaining net 
proceeds of this offering. We have no current plans, agreements or commitments 
for any material acquisitions or licenses of any technologies, products or 
businesses. 

We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, along with our existing 
cash resources, will be sufficient to enable us to fund the development costs 
of, and complete patient enrollment in, the CRMD003 pivotal clinical trial,
and in parallel develop CRMD001 for the CIN indication through completion of 
the phase II biomarker proof of concept study to the point of commencing the 
phase III trial, as well as advance the pre-clinical development of CRMD004 
and CRMD002 as described above. We will need to raise additional funds

development of CRMD001 for the CIN indication, to further develop CRMD002 or
CRMD004 through and beyond the pre-clinical stage, to develop CRMD001 for the 
CKD indication (should we decide to pursue such development) or to develop any 
new product candidates. 

Pending application of the net proceeds, as described above, we intend to

approximately $10.3 million, or $12.0 million if the underwriters exercise

The principal purposes for this offering are to fund our development 
activities, including clinical trials for our most advanced product 
candidates, CRMD003 and CRMD001, and pre-clinical development of our other 
product candidates, CRMD004 and CRMD002, to increase our working capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock, to increase our ability to access 
the capital markets in the future, for general corporate purposes and to 
provide liquidity for our existing stockholders. 

We anticipate using the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

•  approximately $5.3 million for CRMD003 development to include the
   following:  
 
º  development of the final formulation for clinical trial use;  
 
º  FDA regulatory filing costs;  
 
º  pivotal clinical trial development costs;  
 
º  patent maintenance fees;

term notes, which was $33.9 million as of December 31, 2009, thereby reducing 
our interest expense and eliminating the restrictive covenants and other

million, based upon an initial public offering price of $18.00 per share and 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of

We currently intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for the 
following purposes and in the following amounts: 

  •  Approximately $350.0 million of the net proceeds to us from this offering 
     will be used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, including
     any redemption premiums or discounts and accrued interest. 
     
     Specifically, we commenced a tender offer on February 26, 2010 to purchase
     the maximum principal amount of our 8% Senior Notes, 9% Senior 
     Subordinated Notes and 11.25% Senior Subordinated Notes that we can 
     acquire for an aggregate of $350.0 million in cash, including redemption 
     premiums or discounts and accrued interest. The tender offer is structured
     as a modified “Dutch” auction in which the holders of such notes that 
     elect to participate in such offer must specify the minimum price that 
     each would be willing to receive in exchange for each $1,000 or €1,000, 
     as applicable, within a specific minimum and maximum price range set 
     forth in the tender offer materials. Based on such specified prices, we 
     will determine the lowest single premium for all tenders across each 
     series such that we are able to spend an aggregate of $350.0 million. The 
     price ranges that we offered with respect to each series of the notes were
     determined at the time we commenced the offer based in large part on the 
     recent bid and asked prices of such notes in the over-the-counter market. 
     The amount of notes that we will purchase in the tender offer within each 
     series of notes will depend ultimately on the prices specified by the 
     holders within each specified price ranges. The price range we offered in 
     the tender offer for the 8% Senior Notes is 90.00% to 100.00%, the 9% 
     Senior Subordinated Notes is 87.50% to 97.50%, and the 11.25% Senior 
     Subordinated Notes is 95.63% to 105.63%, of the respective aggregate 
     principal amounts. We have estimated that the tender offer will result in 
     the repurchase of $153.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8% 
     Senior Notes, $114.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the 9% 
     Senior Subordinated Notes and $88.8 million in aggregate principal amount 
     of the 11.25% Senior Subordinated Notes, which implies an overall 
     repurchase price equal to approximately 95.59% of the aggregate principal 
     amount of such notes. In calculating these amounts, we assumed that we 
     would repurchase approximately 45.2% of each outstanding series of notes 
     at a repurchase price equal to the mid-point of each of the price ranges 
     listed above. Each 1.0% change in our assumed overall repurchase price of
     95.59% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes would increase or 
     decrease the principal amount of 8% Senior Notes, 9% Senior Subordinated 
     Notes and 11.25% Senior Subordinated Notes that we repurchase in the 
     tender offer by $1.6 million, $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
     We do not believe that any such changes from the estimates set forth 
     above with respect to the aggregate principal amount of each series of 
     notes that will be repurchased in the tender offer will be material to us 
     in terms of having a material impact on our future aggregate level of 
     indebtedness, future interest expense, amortization requirements, 
     scheduled maturities, the terms of the covenants applicable to us or on 
     the overall composition of the holders of such notes. In addition, we 
     expect to pay approximately $8.4 million in accrued interest on the 
     portion of our indebtedness that we intend to repurchase. The tender offer
     is subject to the completion of this offering. Our 8% Senior Notes, 9% 
     Senior Subordinated Notes and 11.25% Senior Subordinated Notes mature on 
     May 1, 2014, May 1, 2016 and January 15, 2014, respectively. 

  •  Approximately $2.0 million of the net proceeds to us from this offering 
     will be used to pay fees and expenses to complete such tender offer. 
 
  •  Approximately $22.1 million of the net proceeds to us from this offering 
     will be used to pay management fees associated with an advisory agreement 
     we have with the Sponsors. 
 
  •  Approximately $62.2 million of the net proceeds to us from this offering 
     will be retained by us and used for general corporate purposes. 
 
The fees and expenses of this offering will include a 1.0% financing fee on 
the gross proceeds from our sale of ordinary shares in this offering payable to
the Sponsors pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement with them. This 
fee will be approximately $4.7 million and will result in the Sponsors 
receiving an aggregate of $26.8 million under the advisory agreement in 
connection with this offering. 
 
Until we use the net proceeds to us from this offering, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. 
We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return. 
We do not have any specific plans with respect to that portion of the net 
proceeds identified above that we intend to use for general corporate purposes.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of 
these net proceeds. We believe that retaining these net proceeds will afford 
us significant flexibility to pursue our business strategy of expanding the 
application of our products through product development and our geographic 
reach, investing in our workforce and making selective acquisitions. 

A company indirectly owned by Bain Capital and certain members of our 
management currently owns €42.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.25%
Senior Subordinated Notes and will receive some of the net proceeds from this 
offering from the repurchase of some or all of such 11.25% Senior Subordinated 
Notes. In addition, affiliates of several of the underwriters are holders of 
our 8% Senior Notes, 9% Senior Subordinated Notes and/or 11.25% Senior 
Subordinated Notes, some of which we currently intend to repurchase with a 
portion of the net proceeds to us from this offering. As a result, some of the 
underwriters or their affiliates may receive part of the proceeds to us from 
this offering by reason of the repayment of our long-term indebtedness."

sale of shares of Common Stock offered by this prospectus, based on the 
initial public offering price of $14.00 per share and after deducting assumed 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us (other than certain expenses to be reimbursed by the underwriters). 
Prior to the date of this prospectus, Genco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
made a capital contribution to us of $75 million in exchange for shares of our 
Class B Stock. Amounts which Genco has advanced to us were credited against 
this $75 million. Genco provided this capital contribution from its existing 
cash as well as cash from operations. 

We expect to use approximately $284.2 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering and the capital contribution from Genco to acquire the six vessels 
comprising our initial fleet, and will use the remainder of these amounts for
working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future 
vessel purchases. 

To the extent we cannot complete the purchase of the vessels intended to 
comprise our initial fleet, we may use the proceeds of this offering to 
purchase other vessels or for general corporate purposes. In particular, 
certain events may arise which could result in us not taking delivery of a 
vessel, such as a total loss of a vessel, a constructive total loss of a 
vessel, or substantial damage to a vessel prior to its delivery."
ANTHERA PHARMACEUTICALS INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/anthera-pharmaceuticals-inc-662796-62065,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/anthera-pharmaceuticals-inc-662796-62065,424B1,3/2/2010,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7094845,"We estimate that the net proceeds of the sale of the common stock that we 
are offering will be approximately $36.7 million, or $42.6 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based on the 
initial public offering price of $7.00 per share and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
that we must pay. 
  
A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the initial public offering price of $7.00 
per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this 
offering by approximately $5.6 million, assuming the number of shares offered 
by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same 
and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. 
  
The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working 
capital to fund anticipated operating expenses, establish a public market 
for our common stock and facilitate future access to the public markets. 
In addition, we will receive an aggregate of $17.1 million from the 
issuance of shares of our common stock to certain of our investors 
pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement, which we expect to occur 
concurrently with the closing of this offering. 
  
We estimate that we will use the proceeds of this offering and the 
concurrent common stock issuance as follows: 
  
 • approximately $37.8 million of these net proceeds to fund the continued 
   clinical development of A-002, including our planned initiation after 
   completion of this offering of the VISTA-16 study;  
   
 • approximately $10.0 million of these net proceeds to fund the 
   continued clinical development of A-623, including completing preparatory 
   work for the initiation of a Phase 2b clinical study; and  

 • approximately $6.0 million for general corporate purposes, such as 
   general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, working 
   capital, prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual property and 
   the potential investment in technologies or products that complement our 
   business.  

We have no current understandings, commitments or agreements with respect 
to any acquisition of or investment in any technologies or products. We 
currently do not plan to use any of the proceeds of this offering to fund 
continued development of A-001. 
  
Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds as 
described above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of funds may 
be necessary, or the proceeds may not be sufficient to complete our Phase 3 
clinical study for A-002 and a Phase 2b clinical study for A-623. 
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the progress of our development and commercialization 
efforts, the progress of our clinical studies, whether or not we enter into 
strategic collaborations or partnerships and our operating costs and 
expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility 
in applying these net proceeds.

The costs and timing of drug development and regulatory approval, particularly 
conducting clinical studies, are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial 
risks and can often change. Accordingly, we may change the allocation of use 
of these proceeds as a result of contingencies such as the progress and results
of our clinical studies and other development activities, the establishment of 
collaborations, our manufacturing requirements and regulatory or competitive 
developments. In addition, although we expect the net proceeds from this 
offering and the concurrent common stock issuance to be sufficient to fund 
our A-002 program through the planned DSMB futility analysis and to fund our 
A-623 program through the primary endpoint of our planned Phase 2b study, 
assuming our current clinical programs proceed further to the next stage of 
clinical development, we do not expect our existing capital resources and the 
net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent common stock issuance to be 
sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of all such clinical development
programs through commercial introduction. Accordingly, we intend to fund any 
financing shortfall for the development of our A-002 and A-623 clinical 
programs through debt financing or additional equity financing. 
  
Pending use of the proceeds as described above or otherwise, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing, investment-grade 
securities."

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before paying offering 
expenses, from the issuance and sale of 11,720,000 common units offered by 
this prospectus. We expect to use these net proceeds, together with $200 
million of borrowings under our new credit facility, to repay intercompany 
indebtedness owed to PAA in the amount of approximately $433.9 million. 
PAA expects to use all or a portion of these proceeds to repay amounts 
outstanding under its credit facilities and for general partnership purposes. 
  
As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $451 million of intercompany 
indebtedness outstanding to PAA with a fixed interest rate of 6.5% incurred 
to refinance project debt and for capital expenditures. We expect that any 
intercompany indebtedness not repaid in connection with this offering will be 
extinguished and treated as a capital contribution and part of PAA’s 
investment in us. 
  
The proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase 
additional common units will be used to reimburse PAA for capital expenditures 
it incurred with respect to the assets contributed to us. If the underwriters 
do not exercise their option to purchase additional common units, we will 
issue 1,758,000 common units to PAA at the expiration of the option period. 
If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional common units, the number of units purchased by the underwriters 
pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the remainder, if
any, will be issued to PAA. Accordingly, the exercise of the underwriters’
option will not affect the total number of units outstanding or the amount 
of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all units.

general corporate purposes, including the enhancement of our software and

following:

  of credit with Comerica Bank dated October 26, 2007, as amended, that has a
  maturity date of April 26, 2011 and bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR,

  with Comerica Bank dated October 26, 2007 that has a maturity date of
  September 30, 2011 and bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR, not less
  than 2%, plus a margin of 3%, or 5% at December 31, 2009. 
    
We may also use a portion of the proceeds to expand our current business 
through acquisitions or investments in other complementary businesses, 
particularly those with similar clients and adjacent products or technologies. 
We have no agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisitions at this
time. 

Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we 
intend to invest the net proceeds in short and intermediate term interest 
bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or 
direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States government.

We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to our operating

received from us as follows: 

   •   $1.8 million to acquire the interests of the contributors of our 
       contribution properties who are not receiving common stock or operating 
       partnership units, which amount will increase to the extent that debt 
       relating to our contribution properties is repaid subsequent to

       properties, 
 
   •   $13.1 million to repay the following debt related to our contribution 
       properties: 
 
   ¡    a loan secured by Newport Towne Center with a principal amount 
        outstanding as of December 31, 2009 of $6.2 million, an adjustable 
        interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%, and a maturity date of June 1, 2010,
 
   ¡    a loan secured by Red Rock Commons with a principal amount outstanding

   ¡    $1.4 million of payables due to Mr. Sabin for net advances made for 
        mortgage debt repayments and other capital items relating to Red Rock 
        Commons. Mr. Sabin will use this amount in its entirety to repay his 
        personal credit facility that was used to fund the advances, 
 
   •   $0.2 million to pay costs related to the assumption of debt on our 
       contribution properties, 
 
   •   $133.6 million to fund the equity portion of our acquisition properties,
       excluding closing costs, and 
 
   •   $0.5 million to pay costs related to the assumption of debt on our 
       acquisition properties. 
 
The net proceeds remaining after the uses described above, which are estimated 
to be $44.5 million, as well as the proceeds intended for any of the 
acquisitions described below that are not consummated, will be used to pay 
closing costs on our acquisition properties, to acquire additional properties 
and for general corporate and working capital purposes. If the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we expect to use the additional 
net proceeds, which will be $29.5 million, to acquire additional properties and
for general corporate and working capital purposes. 

Pending application of cash proceeds, we will invest such portion of the net 
proceeds in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing 
securities, which are consistent with our intention to qualify for taxation as 
a REIT.

(1)  The amount of cash and number of shares of common stock and operating 
     partnership units to be issued in exchange for our contribution properties
     will increase to the extent that debt relating to our contribution 
     properties is repaid subsequent to September 30, 2009 and prior to our 
     acquisition of the contribution properties. During the period from 
     September 30, 2009 to March 31, 2010, the following amounts of debt were 
     repaid: (a) $81 relating to Five Forks Place, (b) $57 relating to Newport 
     Towne Center, (c) $122 relating to Excel Centre and (d) $330 relating to 
     Red Rock Commons.

(2)  None of our directors or officers will receive any cash in exchange for 
     our contribution properties. 
 
(3)  Includes approximately $1,355 of payables due to Mr. Sabin for net 
     advances made for mortgage debt repayments and other capital items 
     relating to Red Rock Commons. Mr. Sabin will use this amount in its 
     entirety to repay his personal credit facility that was used to fund the 
     advances. 
 
(4)  We have agreed to purchase Plaza at Rockwall Phase I and Plaza at Rockwall
     Phase II for an aggregate purchase price of $41,000, excluding closing 
     costs. We have allocated $35,031 to Plaza at Rockwall Phase I and $5,969 
     to Plaza at Rockwall Phase II. 
 
(5)  The aggregate purchase price for Grant Creek Town Center is approximately 
     $21,766, but may be increased for amounts to be paid to the seller after 
     the closing date for additional lease-up of vacant space. The purchase 
     price will be increased by an amount equal to the difference between the 
     actual annualized net operating income on the closing date and October 
     1, 2011, divided by 9.00%, adjusted for certain expenses. 
 
(6)  We will pay a base purchase price for Shops at Foxwood consisting of (a) 
     an amount equal to the actual annualized net operating income generated by
     this property (excluding two ground leases) at the time of the closing of 
     the sale, divided by 8.25%, and adjusted for certain expenses, plus (b) 
     approximately $1,700 with respect to two ground leases. One year after 
     the closing of the sale, we will pay an additional purchase price equal 
     to (a) the difference between the actual annualized net operating income 
     on the closing date and the one-year anniversary date, divided by 8.25%, 
     and adjusted for certain expenses, plus (b) a vacant space fee of $0.13 
     per square foot for any remaining vacant building square footage. Assuming
     full occupancy at the time of the purchase of this property, the aggregate
     purchase price for Shops at Foxwood is expected to be approximately 
     $14,532. The seller is responsible for leasing available space through the
     one-year anniversary date of the closing of the sale. 
 
(7)  Amount does not reflect mark-to-market adjustments of $1,555, which would 
     result in an aggregate of approximately $71,126 of condensed combined 
     indebtedness on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2009.

(1)  None of our directors or officers will receive any cash in exchange for 
     our contribution properties. 
 
(2)  The amount of cash and number of shares of common stock and operating 
     partnership units to be issued in exchange for our contribution properties
     will increase to the extent that debt relating to our contribution 
     properties is repaid subsequent to September 30, 2009 and prior to our 
     acquisition of the contribution properties, which repayments amounted to 
     an aggregate of approximately $363 as of December 31, 2009 (an aggregate 
     of approximately $590 as of March 31, 2010). 
 
The amount of cash, shares of common stock and operating partnership units that
we will pay in exchange for our contribution properties was determined by our 
executive officers based on a discounted cash flow analysis, a capitalization 
rate analysis, an internal rate of return analysis and an assessment of the 
fair market value of the properties. No single factor was given greater weight 
than any other in valuing the properties, and the values attributed to the 
properties do not necessarily bear any relationship to the book value for the 
applicable property. We did not obtain any recent third-party property 
appraisals of the properties to be contributed to us in our formation 
transactions, or any other independent third-party valuations or fairness 
opinions in connection with our formation transactions. As a result, the 
consideration we pay for these properties and other assets in our formation 
transactions may exceed their fair market value."

stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, fees and 
offering expenses, will be approximately $76.4 million to us at an offering 
price of $12.00 per share. We estimate that our net proceeds from the Proposed 
Senior Notes Offering will be approximately $189.0 million. 

If we do not complete our Proposed Senior Notes Offering we expect to use the 
net proceeds of this offering to repay approximately $25.0 million in 
indebtedness outstanding under our First Lien Term Loan Facility plus the 
accrued but unpaid interest thereon. The remaining net proceeds from this 
offering will be used for anticipated capital expenditures and general working 
capital purposes. 

If we do complete the Proposed Senior Notes Offering, we expect to use the net 
proceeds of this offering and the Proposed Senior Notes Offering to repay all 
of the approximate $113.9 million in indebtedness outstanding under our First 
Lien Term Loan Facility, the approximate $50.0 million in indebtedness 
outstanding under our Second Lien Credit Agreement, the approximate 
$5.4 million outstanding under our Construction Loan Agreement and our 
approximate $2.1 million of outstanding capital lease obligations, in each 
case, plus the accrued but unpaid interest thereon. The remaining net proceeds 
from this offering and the Proposed Senior Notes Offering will be used for 
anticipated capital expenditures and general working capital purposes. 

We intend to terminate our Existing Revolving Credit Facility upon repayment 
in full of the indebtedness outstanding under our Existing Credit Facilities. 
See ""In connection with the closing of our Proposed Senior Notes Offering, we 
expect to enter into our New Revolving Credit Facility. Until such time as we 
enter into our New Revolving Credit Facility, our ability to finance our 
working capital needs may be limited"" for a further discussion of risks 
relating to the termination of our Existing Revolving Credit Facility. 

The table below sets forth our anticipated use of the net proceeds from this 
offering, assuming that we do not consummate the Proposed Senior Notes 
Offering, and from this offering and the Proposed Senior Notes Offering 
assuming a concurrent closing. We currently do not anticipate immediately 
borrowing any funds under our New Revolving Credit Agreement upon the closing 
of that facility.

We expect to spend approximately $40.0 million on capital expenditures 
(excluding capital expenditures relating to our multi-client services) for 
property, plant and equipment in 2010, of which approximately $7.0 million is 
expected to be allocated to the maintenance of our facilities and equipment. 
The remaining approximately $33.0 million of our 2010 capital expenditures 
budget is expected to be allocated to the development and purchase of 
additional equipment, including the development of land and seafloor nodal 
technologies. The remaining net proceeds, consisting of approximately 
$11.4 million if we do not complete the Proposed Notes Offering and 
approximately $54.1 million if we do complete the Proposed Notes Offering, 
will be used for general corporate purposes and, pending such use, will be 
invested in cash equivalents. While we do not have any definitive plans 
regarding the application of these additional net proceeds, we may use a 
portion to expand our international operations. If the underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, we would receive approximately an 
additional $7.0 million in net proceeds. We expect that these additional net 
proceeds would be allocated to general corporate purposes. 

The First Lien Term Loan Facility matures on January 16, 2015, and as of 
December 31, 2009, there was approximately $113.9 million in indebtedness 
outstanding thereunder. Borrowings under the First Lien Term Loan Facility 
bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 5.25% or the prime rate plus 
4.25%. Our First Lien Term Loan Facility has a LIBOR floor equal to 3.0%. The 
outstanding borrowings under the First Lien Term Loan Facility were incurred 
to refinance existing indebtedness. 

The Second Lien Credit Agreement matures on July 16, 2015, and as of December 
31, 2009, there was approximately $50.0 million in indebtedness outstanding 
thereunder. Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement bear interest at
a rate equal to LIBOR plus 9.0% or the prime rate plus 8.0%. Our Second Lien 
Credit Agreement has a LIBOR floor equal to 3.0%. The outstanding borrowings 
under the Second Lien Credit Agreement were incurred to refinance existing 
indebtedness. 

Our Construction Loan Agreement matures on September 30, 2019, and as of 
December 31, 2009, there was approximately $5.4 million outstanding 
thereunder. Loans outstanding under our Construction Loan Agreement bear 
interest at a fixed rate equal to 5.453%. Borrowings under that agreement were
incurred to finance the construction of our headquarters facility. 

As of December 31, 2009, we had capital lease obligations of approximately 
$2.1 million bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.14% to 11.4% under 
capital leases which terminate starting in March 2010 and ending in September 
2014. Those leases were entered into to finance the purchase of certain 
equipment. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common 
stock in this offering by the selling stockholders. 

In addition, an affiliate of one of the participating underwriters, Credit 
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, is a lender under our Existing Credit Facilities 
and as a result of the repayment of indebtedness under our Existing Credit 
Facilities, will indirectly receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering."

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

• to repay $30.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit
  facility. As of January 31, 2010, the principal amount outstanding under
  this credit facility was $30.0 million. This credit facility currently has
  an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR,
  plus 3.25% and has a maturity date of August 16, 2012; 
 
• to repay $72.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our first lien term
  loan. As of January 31, 2010, the principal amount outstanding under this
  loan was $288.1 million. This loan has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus
  3.25% and has a maturity date of August 16, 2014; and 
 
• to fund working capital and for general corporate purposes, which may
  include acquisitions. 
 
While we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this 
offering as described above, we may reallocate the net proceeds from time to 
time depending upon market and other conditions in effect at the time. 
Although we occasionally evaluate potential acquisition and investment 
opportunities, we have no current arrangements or commitments with respect to 
any particular transaction. Pending their application, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

above, we have not yet determined with any certainty the manner in which we 
will allocate our net proceeds. Our management will retain broad discretion 
in the allocation and use of our net proceeds of this offering. The amounts

including the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and 
technological developments, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. 
For example, if we were to expand our operations more rapidly than 
anticipated by our current plans, a greater portion of the proceeds would 
likely be used for the development or enhancement of our proprietary 
technologies. Alternatively, if we were to engage in an acquisition that 
required a significant cash outlay, some or all of the proceeds might be 
used for that purpose.

$137,500,000 after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and

The underwriters will forego the receipt of payment of $0.60 per share until we
have purchased hotel properties with an aggregate purchase price (including the
aggregate purchase price of the initial acquisition hotels) equal to at least 
85% of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement
(after deducting the full underwriting discount and other estimated offering 
expenses payable by us). 
  
Concurrently with this offering, in a separate private placement pursuant to 
Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, we will sell 
500,000 common shares (representing $10 million in proceeds) to our chief 
executive officer, Jeffrey H. Fisher, at a price per share equal to the price 
to the public, and without payment by us of any underwriting discount or 
commission. 
  
We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement to our operating partnership. Our operating partnership will use 
approximately $73.5 million, or 53%, of the net proceeds to purchase the 
initial acquisition hotels from the seller. 
  
We intend to invest approximately $11 million over the next two years to 
enhance the quality of the six initial acquisition hotels. This capital will be
used to upgrade guest rooms and common areas and includes our estimate of the 
amounts Hilton will require us to spend as part of a property improvement plan,
or PIP, for the hotels. We believe that this investment will improve the 
quality of the initial acquisition hotels, further differentiate them from 
their primary competitors, and enhance their performance. We believe that the 
current market environment, with depressed hotel operating performance, 
provides an attractive time to complete the planned renovations of the initial 
acquisition hotels because there will be less displacement of guests and lost 
revenues due to current low occupancy rates and room rates than in a more 
robust economic environment. We believe that investing in our properties in the
current environment will also better position them to outperform competing 
properties as economic conditions improve. 
  
Our operating partnership will use the remaining net proceeds to invest in 
hotel properties in accordance with our investment strategy described in this 
prospectus and for general business purposes. We generally intend to invest the
remaining net proceeds as promptly as we can identify hotel acquisition 
opportunities that are consistent with our investment strategy, with a general 
goal of seeking to invest the remaining net proceeds within 12 to 15 months 
following completion of this offering, depending on the amount of time 
necessary to evaluate a target property’s suitability based on our acquisition 
criteria. However, we cannot predict if or when we will identify and acquire 
hotels that meet our acquisition criteria so as to permit us to invest the net 
proceeds of this offering. Prior to the full investment of the offering 
proceeds in hotel properties, we intend to invest in interest-bearing short-
term securities or money-market accounts that are consistent with our intention
to qualify as a REIT. Such investments may include, for example, government and
government agency certificates, certificates of deposit, interest-bearing bank 
deposits and mortgage loan participations. These initial investments are 
expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from 
investments in hotel properties. 
  
We will use approximately $3.5 million of the net proceeds to reimburse Mr. 
Fisher for out-of-pocket expenses Mr. Fisher incurred in connection with our 
formation and this offering, including $2.5 million Mr. Fisher funded as 
earnest money deposits (credited against the total purchase price of $73.5 
million), as required by the purchase agreement for the initial acquisition 
hotels. We will also use $10,000 to repurchase the shares he acquired in

government agency certificates, certificates of deposit, interest-bearing bank 
deposits and mortgage loan participations. These initial investments are 
expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from 
investments in hotel properties. 
  
We will use approximately $3.5 million of the net proceeds to reimburse Mr. 
Fisher for out-of-pocket expenses Mr. Fisher incurred in connection with our 
formation and this offering, including $2.5 million Mr. Fisher funded as 
earnest money deposits (credited against the total purchase price of $73.5 
million), as required by the purchase agreement for the initial acquisition 
hotels. We will also use $10,000 to repurchase the shares he acquired in 
connection with our formation and initial capitalization."
METALS USA HOLDINGS CORP.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/metals-usa-holdings-corp-710185-58410,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/metals-usa-holdings-corp-710185-58410,424B4,4/9/2010,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7180620,"Our net proceeds from this offering are estimated to be approximately 
$219.6 million after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions and offering expenses that will be paid out of the proceeds of 
this offering. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the shares 
being sold by us in this offering as follows: 

. approximately $171.6 million to make an offer to all holders of our 2007 
  Notes to repurchase the maximum principal amount of the 2007 Notes that may
  be purchased out of the net proceeds of this offering, estimated to be
  approximately $171.6 million, at a price equal to 100% of the principal
  amount, which includes accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the
  closing of the repurchase offer; 
 
. the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. 
 

Under the terms of the indenture governing the 2007 Notes, we are required to 
offer to repurchase all of a holder’s 2007 Notes or a pro rata portion 
thereof. The 2007 Notes must be repurchased no earlier than 30 days nor later 
than 60 days from the date we commence the repurchase offer, which may be 
commenced no later than 60 days following our receipt of the proceeds of this 
offering. Prior to the commencement of the repurchase offer, we must 
irrevocably deposit the net proceeds of this offering with the trustee, Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A., and the proceeds must be invested in cash or cash 
equivalents to be held for the payment of the purchase price of the 2007 
Notes. We cannot assure you that holders of the 2007 Notes, of which 
$161.1 million aggregate principal amount (which is net of approximately 
$2.6 million of remaining unamortized original issue discount, as of December 
31, 2009) are outstanding as of December 31, 2009, will accept our offer. If 
the amount deposited is greater than the purchase price of the 2007 Notes 
tendered by holders, the trustee will deliver the excess to us immediately 
after the expiration of the repurchase offer. We will use the balance of the 
net proceeds, if any, for general corporate purposes, as described below. In 
lieu of the repurchase offer, we may, at our option, pursuant to the terms of 
the indenture governing the 2007 Notes, elect to send a redemption notice to 
all holders of the 2007 Notes calling for the full and unconditional 
redemption of the 2007 Notes. Notice of such redemption will be sent at least 
30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date. As with the 
repurchase offer, the redemption price will equal 100% of the principal 
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, estimated to 
be approximately $171.6 million. Unlike the repurchase offer, however, holders 
of the 2007 Notes subject to redemption may not elect to continue to hold 
their 2007 Notes and as such, it is expected that none of the 2007 Notes will 
be outstanding following this offering and the consummation of a redemption. 

Our affiliates, including Apollo, that are holders of the 2007 Notes may 
participate in the repurchase offer or the redemption.

We will use the net proceeds in excess of the purchase price of the 2007 Notes 
tendered in the repurchase offer or redeemed pursuant to a redemption notice 
for general corporate purposes. General corporate purposes includes working 
capital, the expansion of our production capabilities, research and 
development, purchases of capital equipment and potential acquisitions of 
businesses that we believe are complementary to our business. We have not 
determined the specific portion of any net proceeds to be used for these 
purposes, and the net proceeds from this offering have not been accounted for 
in our normal budgeting process. Although from time to time we evaluate 
possible acquisitions of companies and assets, we currently have no definitive 
commitments or agreements to make any acquisitions, and cannot assure you that
we will make any acquisitions in the future. The amounts actually expended for 
these purposes may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, 
including the amount of cash we generate from future operations, the actual 
expenses of operating our business, opportunities that may be or become 
available to us and the other factors. Notwithstanding the uses described 
above, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of any remaining net 
proceeds after the purchase or the redemption of the 2007 Notes. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the 
selling stockholders named in this prospectus pursuant to the underwriters’ 
exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. In the aggregate, the 
selling stockholders will receive approximately $33.8 million of proceeds from 
this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and offering expenses, if the underwriters’ option to purchase 
additional shares is exercised in full.

The initial five interest payments on the 2007 Notes were paid solely in cash. 
For any interest period thereafter, we may elect to pay (1) interest entirely 
in cash or (2) PIK Interest or (3) Partial PIK Interest. On September 26, 
2008, we made a permitted election under the indenture governing the 2007 
Notes to pay all interest that was due on January 1, 2009, for the interest 
period beginning on October 1, 2008, and ending on December 31, 2008, entirely 
through PIK Interest. The January 1, 2009 PIK Interest payment amounted to 
$8.2 million. We have continued to make PIK interest payments subsequent to 
January 1, 2009. The April 1, 2009 PIK interest payment amounted to 
$5.6 million, the July 1, 2009 PIK interest payment amounted to $3.8 million, 
the October 1, 2009 PIK interest payment amounted to $3.5 million and the 
January 1, 2010 PIK interest payment amounted to $3.1 million. The Company 
must make an election regarding whether subsequent interest payments will be
made in cash, through PIK Interest, or Partial PIK Interest, prior to the 
start of the applicable interest period. In the absence of such an election 
for any interest period, interest on the 2007 Notes will be payable according 
to the election for the previous interest period. As a result, the PIK 
Interest election is now the default election for future interest periods 
unless we elect otherwise not later than the commencement of an interest 
period. 

Cash interest on the 2007 Notes will accrue at a rate per annum, reset 
quarterly, equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 6.00%, which increases by 0.25% to 
6.25% in the second year of the issuance of the 2007 Notes, by 0.50% to 6.50% 
in the third year of the issuance of the 2007 Notes, and by 0.75% to 6.75% in 
the fourth year of the issuance of the 2007 Notes. In the event PIK Interest 
is paid on the 2007 Notes, the then-applicable margin over LIBOR on 2007 Notes 
would increase by 0.75% for each period in which PIK Interest is paid. The 
2007 Notes, including any notes issued to pay PIK Interest or Partial PIK 
Interest, mature on July 1, 2012."

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, based 
on an assumed initial public offering price of $5.00 per share and after 
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option 
is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately 
$30.1 million. 

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital 
markets and to increase our liquidity. We expect to use the net proceeds of 
this offering for the following purposes: 

• approximately $6.0 million to fund our Phase I clinical trial for our
  Neo-Urinary Conduit; 
 
• approximately $6.0 million to fund our preclinical research and development
  activities for our Neo-Kidney Augment; 
 
• approximately $3.0 million for maintaining our research and manufacturing
  facilities; and 
 
• the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes.  

Based on our current operating plans, we expect the proceeds of this offering,
together with our existing resources, to be sufficient to fund our planned 
operations, including our continued product candidate development, to March 
2011. We will need to raise more funds to complete our Phase I clinical trial 
for our Neo-Urinary Conduit and our preclinical research and development 
activities for our Neo-Kidney Augment. We will also need to raise more funds 
to maintain our research and manufacturing facilities beyond March 2011. 

As of December 31, 2009, we had $22.3 million of debt outstanding, consisting 
of working capital notes totaling $17.3 million, with payments due through 
September 2011 and bearing an average interest rate of 12.26%, equipment and 
supplemental working capital notes totaling $4.0 million, with payments due 
through April 2012 and bearing an average interest rate of 11.68%, and 
a machinery and equipment note of $1.0 million, with payments due through 
January 2012 and bearing an interest rate of 5.0%. In March 2009, we incurred 
$0.5 million of this debt to fund equipment purchases and related maintenance 
costs. 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including the progress in, and costs of, our preclinical and clinical
programs and the amount and timing of revenues, if any, from our 
collaborations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds
for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of 
the net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

(1)  Includes amounts payable to public stockholders holding up to 4,400,000 
     of the shares sold in this offering (or 5,060,000 shares if the
     underwriters’ over allotment option is exercised in full) who properly
     redeem their shares in connection with our successful consummation of
     our initial business transaction. Assuming a per share redemption price
     of $10.00 per share (or approximately $9.98 per share stock if the
     underwriters’ over allotment option is exercised in full), $44,000,000
     of the proceeds of this offering (or approximately $50,474,600 if
     underwriters’ over allotment option is exercised in full) would be
     payable to such stockholders. 
  
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been pre-funded with the proceeds
     of an aggregate of $12,349 in loans and advances, as of March 31, 2010,
     from our sponsor and one of our executive officers. This loan and advance
     will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering upon the consummation
     of this offering. 

(3)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of
     the insider warrants.  For purposes of presentation, the underwriting
     discount is reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon
     consummation of this offering.   


(4)  This amount assumes: (i) no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
     option; and (ii) that none of our public stockholders redeem their
     shares of common stock such that the contingent fees that will become
     payable from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event
     we consummate our initial business transaction include a deferred fee
     payable to the underwriters equal to 1.1% of the gross proceeds from
     the sale of the units to the public. In the event that 88% of our public
     stockholders redeem their shares, we estimate a deferred fee of 1.1%
    ($550,000). 
  
(5) We have agreed to pay our counsel, an additional $100,000, only upon
    completion of our initial business transaction. 


(6) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our
    current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring
    a business transaction based upon the level of complexity of such
    business transaction.  In the event we identify an acquisition target in
    a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as
    a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended
    use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available
    for our expenses. 
  
Of the net proceeds of this offering, an aggregate of $50,000,000 (or 
$57,357,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
full) will be deposited into the trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, 
N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. 
None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, 
other than to pay taxes, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of 
a business transaction within 15 months from the date hereof and (ii) our 
redemption of the public shares sold in this offering if we are unable to 
consummate a business transaction within 15 months from the date hereof. The 
proceeds held in the trust account (net of taxes but exclusive of any 
contingent fees payable or used to pay public stockholders who have exercised 
their redemption rights) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of 
a target business with which we ultimately complete a business transaction 
or, if there are insufficient funds not held in trust, to pay other expenses 
relating to such transaction such as reimbursement to insiders for 
out-of-pocket expenses, third party due diligence expenses or potential 
finders fees, in each case only upon the consummation of a business 
transaction. In the event there are funds remaining in the trust account 
after satisfaction of all of such obligations, such funds may be used to 
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, 
as determined by our board of directors at that time. All amounts held in the 
trust account will be released to us on the closing of our initial business 
transaction with a target business, subject to any amounts payable upon the 
exercise of tender offer or redemption rights, as applicable. 
  
We intend to use a portion of the $600,000 not held in trust for due 
diligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition including 
investment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring and 
negotiating a business transaction, as well as a possible down payment, 
reverse break up fees (a provision which requires a payment to the target 
company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up or 
“no-shop” provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from 
“shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more 
favorable to such target businesses), if necessary. While we do not have 
any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to fund 
a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular proposed business 
transaction, if we were to enter into such a an agreement where we paid for 
the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that 
would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be 
determined based on the terms of the specific business transaction and the 
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds 
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not 
having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due 
diligence with respect to, potential target businesses. In addition to the 
use of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to 
pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. 
  
We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with 
a business transaction, either because the consideration for the business 
transaction is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we 
finance a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or the issuance 
of our debt securities. In such event, the proceeds held in the trust account 
as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance our 
operations, which may include the target business(es) that we acquire in the 
business transaction, to effect other acquisitions, or for expenses, as 
determined by our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, 
among other things, for director and officer compensation, change-in-control 
payments or payments to affiliates, to finance the operations of the target 
business, to make other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy.

To the extent that our capital stock or the issuance of our debt securities 
are used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business 
transaction, or in the event that indebtedness from third parties is used, 
in whole or in part, as consideration to effect a business transaction, the 
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate 
a business transaction will be disbursed to the combined company and will, 
along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used to finance our 
operations. In the event that third party indebtedness is used as 
consideration, our officers and directors would not be personally liable for 
the repayment of such indebtedness. 
  
Our sponsor and one of our executive officers have loaned and advanced to us 
an aggregate of $12,349 as of March 31, 2010, which was used to pay a portion 
of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC 
filing fees, FINRA filing fees, and legal and audit fees and expenses. The 
loan will be payable without interest upon the earlier of December 31, 2010 
or on the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the 
proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account. 
  
The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trust account 
agent only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)
(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or 
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the 
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being 
deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company 
Act of 1940. 
  
No compensation of any kind (including finders, consulting or other similar 
fees or the issuance of any of our securities) will be paid to any of our 
sponsor, officers, directors or any of our or their affiliates, prior to, or 
for any services that they render in order to effectuate, or in connection 
with the consummation of, a business transaction. However, such persons will 
receive reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such 
as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence 
on suitable target businesses and business transactions, as well as traveling 
to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target 
businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will 
be paid by us out of the funds not held in the trust account and currently 
allocated in the above table to “Legal and accounting expenses attendant to 
the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiations of a business 
transaction,” “Due diligence (excluding accounting and legal due diligence) 
of prospective targets” and “Other miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance and 
reserves.” Since the role of present management after a business transaction 
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will 
be paid to those persons after a business transaction. 
  
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on such public stockholder’s portion of the trust 
account, but net of taxes) only in the event of our liquidation, if such 
public stockholder properly exercises his redemption rights in accordance with
the conditions set forth in this prospectus or if we redeem 100% of our 
public shares of common stock for a per share pro rata portion of the trust 
account, including the interest earned thereon, but net of any taxes, if we 
do not consummate a business transaction within 15 months from the date of 
this prospectus. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Our sponsor has 
waived its right to redeem any of its initial shares for a pro rata share of 
the trust account. Additionally, our sponsor, directors and officers have 
agreed not to exercise their redemption rights with respect to shares acquired 
during or subsequent to this offering. Our sponsor has waived its rights to 
participate in any redemption with respect to its initial shares upon our 
redemption of shares sold in this offering if we fail to consummate an initial
business transaction within 15 months. However, if our sponsor or any of our 
officers, directors, advisors or affiliates acquire shares in or after this 
offering, they will be entitled to a pro rata share of the trust account with 
respect to such shares upon our redemption in the event we do not consummate 
a business transaction within the required time period."

(1)  Includes amounts payable to public stockholders holding up to 4,400,000 
     of the shares sold in this offering (or 5,060,000 shares if the
     underwriters’ over allotment option is exercised in full) who properly
     redeem their shares in connection with our successful consummation of
     our initial business transaction. Assuming a per share redemption price
     of $10.00 per share (or approximately $9.98 per share stock if the
     underwriters’ over allotment option is exercised in full), $44,000,000
     of the proceeds of this offering (or approximately $50,474,600 if
     underwriters’ over allotment option is exercised in full) would be
     payable to such stockholders. 
  
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been pre-funded with the proceeds
     of an aggregate of $12,349 in loans and advances, as of March 31, 2010,
     from our sponsor and one of our executive officers. This loan and advance
     will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering upon the consummation
     of this offering. 

(3)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of
     the insider warrants.  For purposes of presentation, the underwriting
     discount is reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon
     consummation of this offering.   


(4)  This amount assumes: (i) no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
     option; and (ii) that none of our public stockholders redeem their
     shares of common stock such that the contingent fees that will become
     payable from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event
     we consummate our initial business transaction include a deferred fee
     payable to the underwriters equal to 1.1% of the gross proceeds from
     the sale of the units to the public. In the event that 88% of our public
     stockholders redeem their shares, we estimate a deferred fee of 1.1%
    ($550,000). 
  
(5) We have agreed to pay our counsel, an additional $100,000, only upon
    completion of our initial business transaction. 


(6) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our
    current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring
    a business transaction based upon the level of complexity of such
    business transaction.  In the event we identify an acquisition target in
    a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as
    a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended
    use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available
    for our expenses. 
  
Of the net proceeds of this offering, an aggregate of $50,000,000 (or 
$57,357,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
full) will be deposited into the trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, 
N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. 
None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, 
other than to pay taxes, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of 
a business transaction within 15 months from the date hereof and (ii) our 
redemption of the public shares sold in this offering if we are unable to 
consummate a business transaction within 15 months from the date hereof. The 
proceeds held in the trust account (net of taxes but exclusive of any 
contingent fees payable or used to pay public stockholders who have exercised 
their redemption rights) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of 
a target business with which we ultimately complete a business transaction 
or, if there are insufficient funds not held in trust, to pay other expenses 
relating to such transaction such as reimbursement to insiders for 
out-of-pocket expenses, third party due diligence expenses or potential 
finders fees, in each case only upon the consummation of a business 
transaction. In the event there are funds remaining in the trust account 
after satisfaction of all of such obligations, such funds may be used to 
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, 
as determined by our board of directors at that time. All amounts held in the 
trust account will be released to us on the closing of our initial business 
transaction with a target business, subject to any amounts payable upon the 
exercise of tender offer or redemption rights, as applicable. 
  
We intend to use a portion of the $600,000 not held in trust for due 
diligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition including 
investment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring and 
negotiating a business transaction, as well as a possible down payment, 
reverse break up fees (a provision which requires a payment to the target 
company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up or 
“no-shop” provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from 
“shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more 
favorable to such target businesses), if necessary. While we do not have 
any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to fund 
a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular proposed business 
transaction, if we were to enter into such a an agreement where we paid for 
the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that 
would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be 
determined based on the terms of the specific business transaction and the 
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds 
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not 
having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due 
diligence with respect to, potential target businesses. In addition to the 
use of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to 
pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. 
  
We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with 
a business transaction, either because the consideration for the business 
transaction is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we 
finance a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or the issuance 
of our debt securities. In such event, the proceeds held in the trust account 
as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance our 
operations, which may include the target business(es) that we acquire in the 
business transaction, to effect other acquisitions, or for expenses, as 
determined by our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, 
among other things, for director and officer compensation, change-in-control 
payments or payments to affiliates, to finance the operations of the target 
business, to make other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy.

To the extent that our capital stock or the issuance of our debt securities 
are used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business 
transaction, or in the event that indebtedness from third parties is used, 
in whole or in part, as consideration to effect a business transaction, the 
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate 
a business transaction will be disbursed to the combined company and will, 
along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used to finance our 
operations. In the event that third party indebtedness is used as 
consideration, our officers and directors would not be personally liable for 
the repayment of such indebtedness. 
  
Our sponsor and one of our executive officers have loaned and advanced to us 
an aggregate of $12,349 as of March 31, 2010, which was used to pay a portion 
of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC 
filing fees, FINRA filing fees, and legal and audit fees and expenses. The 
loan will be payable without interest upon the earlier of December 31, 2010 
or on the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the 
proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account. 
  
The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trust account 
agent only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)
(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or 
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the 
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being 
deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company 
Act of 1940. 
  
No compensation of any kind (including finders, consulting or other similar 
fees or the issuance of any of our securities) will be paid to any of our 
sponsor, officers, directors or any of our or their affiliates, prior to, or 
for any services that they render in order to effectuate, or in connection 
with the consummation of, a business transaction. However, such persons will 
receive reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such 
as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence 
on suitable target businesses and business transactions, as well as traveling 
to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target 
businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will 
be paid by us out of the funds not held in the trust account and currently 
allocated in the above table to “Legal and accounting expenses attendant to 
the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiations of a business 
transaction,” “Due diligence (excluding accounting and legal due diligence) 
of prospective targets” and “Other miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance and 
reserves.” Since the role of present management after a business transaction 
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will 
be paid to those persons after a business transaction. 
  
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on such public stockholder’s portion of the trust 
account, but net of taxes) only in the event of our liquidation, if such 
public stockholder properly exercises his redemption rights in accordance with
the conditions set forth in this prospectus or if we redeem 100% of our 
public shares of common stock for a per share pro rata portion of the trust 
account, including the interest earned thereon, but net of any taxes, if we 
do not consummate a business transaction within 15 months from the date of 
this prospectus. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Our sponsor has 
waived its right to redeem any of its initial shares for a pro rata share of 
the trust account. Additionally, our sponsor, directors and officers have 
agreed not to exercise their redemption rights with respect to shares acquired 
during or subsequent to this offering. Our sponsor has waived its rights to 
participate in any redemption with respect to its initial shares upon our 
redemption of shares sold in this offering if we fail to consummate an initial
business transaction within 15 months. However, if our sponsor or any of our 
officers, directors, advisors or affiliates acquire shares in or after this 
offering, they will be entitled to a pro rata share of the trust account with 
respect to such shares upon our redemption in the event we do not consummate 
a business transaction within the required time period."

deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses that will be paid out of the proceeds of this offering, assuming the 
underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option. In addition, upon 
the closing of this offering, we intend to settle all of our remaining 
fixed-price aluminum hedges, which would have generated proceeds totaling 
$90.1 million as of April 15, 2010. 

We currently intend to use the $70.3 million of net proceeds from the shares 
being sold by us in this offering to redeem or repurchase all outstanding 
Holdco Notes, of which there was a principal amount of $64.1 million 
outstanding as of April 15, 2010. We also currently intend to use the 
remaining $6.2 million of those net offering proceeds, combined with $90.1 
million of proceeds from settling our outstanding aluminum hedges and $26.7 
million of cash on hand to repay $110.0 million principal amount outstanding 
under the term B loan and to pay $13.0 million to Apollo related to the 
termination of Apollo’s management agreement.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will 
receive $11.3 million in additional net proceeds, which will be used to repay 
$11.3 million principal amount outstanding under the term B loan, which will 
offset $11.3 million of the $26.7 million of cash on hand allocated to pay 
down the term B loan and the termination fee described above. 

Under the terms of the indenture governing the Holdco Notes, we are permitted 
to redeem the Holdco Notes at any time on or after May 15, 2010 for 100% of 
their principal amount plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.
We also have the right, at any time, to purchase the Holdco Notes in the 
market at any available price. Under our senior credit facilities we have 
the right to prepay the loans thereunder at any time at par plus accrued
interest. 

The HoldCo Notes cash interest accrues at six-month LIBOR plus 5.75% per
annum, reset semi-annually, and the HoldCo PIK interest, if any, will accrue 
at six-month LIBOR plus 6.5% per annum, reset semi-annually. The PIK interest 
rate was 9.10% at December 31, 2008 and 7.02% at December 31, 2009. The Holdco
Notes mature on June 7, 2014. 

Interest on the term B loan is based either on LIBOR or the prime rate, at 
Noranda AcquisitionCo’s election, in either case plus an applicable margin
(2.00% over LIBOR at December 31, 2008 and 2009) that depends upon the ratio
of Noranda AcquisitionCo’s Senior Secured Net Debt to its EBITDA (in each case
as defined in the credit agreement governing the term B loan). The interest 
rate at December 31, 2009 was 2.23%. The term B loan matures on May 18, 2014."

payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering primarily for 
the following purposes: 

• approximately US$45 million to expand our silicon ingot, silicon wafer, 
  solar cell and solar module production capacity, including procuring new

  capital and other general corporate purposes. 
 
The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and allocate the net 
proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business 
conditions. We believe that available credit under existing bank credit 
facilities, the proceeds of this offering, as well as cash on hand and 
expected operating cash flow, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash 
needs, including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures 
for the next 12 months. Our management, however, will have significant 
flexibility and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering. 
Depending on future events and other changes in the business climate, we may 
determine at a later time to use the net proceeds differently or for purposes 
other than as described in this prospectus. 

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, 
we are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our 
existing and any future PRC subsidiaries through capital contributions, 
subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval 
requirements. We cannot assure you that we can obtain the approvals from the 
relevant government authorities, or complete the registration and filing 
procedures required to use our net proceeds as described above, in each case 
on a timely basis, or at all."

of ADSs sold by us in this offering. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately $16.9 million. Our net proceeds from this offering represent the 
amount we expect to receive after paying the underwriting discounts and 
commissions and other expenses of the offering payable by us. 

Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds 
of this offering. We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering as 
follows: 

 •  $5.8 million for product development;  

 •  $3.6 million to expand research and development center;  

 •  $3.0 million to develop customer relations management (CRM) systems; and  

 •  the balance for working capital.  

We pursue acquisitions of other businesses as part of our business strategy and
may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund acquisitions. We have no 
agreement with respect to any future acquisition, although we assess 
opportunities on an ongoing basis and from time to time have discussions with 
other companies about potential transactions. 

Pending their use, we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in a 
variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term or long-term 
interest-bearing, marketable securities."

    was paid on February 1, 2010.  

(2) Includes payments of $10.0 million to Golden Gate to terminate the
    Advisory Agreement and $3.3 million to Limited Brands to terminate its
    advisory arrangement in the LLC Agreement.  

As of January 30, 2010, we had $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 
indebtedness outstanding ($147.4 million net of unamortized original issue 
discount) under the Term B Loans and $150.0 million aggregate principal amount
of indebtedness outstanding ($147.5 million net of unamortized original issue 
discount) under the Term C Loans under our Topco credit facility. On March 5,

the Term C Loans. The Term B Loans have a maturity date of June 26, 2015. 
Borrowings under our Term B Loans bear interest at a rate of 13.5% per annum 
and we expect to incur a prepayment penalty associated with the prepayment of 
the Term B Loans. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness.” GGC Unlevered

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 
  
We intend to use all of the net proceeds of this offering to prepay 
approximately $40.4 million of the outstanding debt under our credit facility,
approximately $42.8 million to retire our senior subordinated notes and 
accrued interest, and approximately $31.8 million to retire our junior 
subordinated notes, including prepayment penalties and accrued interest. In 
addition, we intend to use approximately $42.5 million of borrowings under an 
anticipated new credit facility, which we anticipate entering into in 
connection with the consummation of this offering, together with approximately
$4.1 million of restricted cash, to retire the approximately $30.6 million 
remaining balance of existing indebtedness and an aggregate of approximately 
$11.5 million of outstanding debt under GTS’ credit facility, to pay 
approximately $1.0 million of refinancing fees, and to pay an aggregate of 
$3.5 million of transaction fees to terminate management and consulting 
agreements with certain affiliates concurrent with this offering. 
  
Our current credit facility includes a $50.0 million revolving credit 
facility, a $40.0 million term note, and a $9.0 million incremental term 
loan. Our credit facility matures in 2012. Availability under the revolving 
credit facility is subject to a borrowing base of eligible accounts 
receivable, as defined in the credit agreement. Interest is payable quarterly 
at LIBOR plus an applicable margin or, at our option, prime plus an applicable
margin. At December 31, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on our credit
facility was 5.4%. Principal is payable in quarterly installments ranging 
from $1.9 million per quarter in 2010 increasing to $2.4 million per quarter 
through December 31, 2011. A final payment of the outstanding principal 
balance is due in 2012. The revolving credit facility also provides for the 
issuance of up to $6.0 million in letters of credit. As of December 31, 2009,
we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $4.4 million. As 
of December 31, 2009, approximately $34.5 million was outstanding under the 
term loans and $35.7 million was outstanding under the revolving credit 
facility. 
  
Our senior subordinated notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount at 
maturity of approximately $36.4 million and will mature on August 31, 2012. 
Each senior subordinated note includes cash interest of 12% plus a deferred 
margin, payable quarterly, that is treated as deferred interest and is added 
to the principal balance of the note each quarter. The deferred interest 
ranges from 3.5% to 7.5% depending on our total leverage calculation, payable 
at maturity in 2012. As of December 31, 2009, there was $41.1 million in 
aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes outstanding. 
  
Our junior subordinated notes were issued in an aggregate face amount of 
$19.5 million and will mature February 28, 2013. Our junior subordinated 
notes include interest of 20% accrued quarterly that is deferred and is added 
to the principal balance of the note each quarter and is payable at maturity 
on February 28, 2013. In addition, the junior subordinated notes agreement 
requires us to pay a premium upon repayment of the junior subordinated notes. 
The applicable premium is based on the timing of the repayment and begins at 
50% of the aggregate principal amount and decreases to 10% over the life of 
the note. We anticipate the prepayment penalty will be approximately $10.6 
million and that accrued and unpaid interest will total approximately $1.7 
million. As of December 31, 2009, there was $16.8 million in aggregate 
principal amount of junior subordinated notes outstanding, net of an 
unaccreted discount of $3.0 million. 
  
GTS’ credit facility consists of a term loan facility of $10.3 million, of 
which approximately $9.9 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2009, 
and a five-year revolving credit facility of up to $4.0 million, of which 
approximately $1.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2009. As of 
December 31, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on GTS’ credit facility
was 4.1%.

We currently expect to allocate the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

Repay Wells Fargo Bank line of credit                    $  2,500,000   18.9 %

A constraint on our ability to grow our sales to meet demand for our varieties 
of alfalfa seed has been our inability to carry large inventories for the 
extended periods of time dictated by the annual planting cycle. One of the 
principal reasons for this offering is to increase our working capital, 
thereby allowing us to aggressively market our alfalfa seed varieties, both 
domestically and internationally, since, ideally, we will have sufficient 
inventory to satisfy any demand created. 

By the time we close this offering, we will have drawn down the entire 
$2,500,000 available under our line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank and will 
pay off the principal and accrued interest in full upon completion of this 
offering. The principal bears interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal 
to 3% above the Daily One Month LIBOR (as defined in the Revolving Line of 
Credit Note) in effect from time to time, and the maturity date is April 1, 
2011. The line of credit continues to be secured by all of our rights to 
certain kinds of payments as set forth in the security agreement and our 
inventories and is subject to personal guarantees provided by certain of our 
related parties, among other guarantors. The proceeds from the line of credit 
have been used for working capital purposes, including making payments to our 
growers. 

Our anticipated expenditures on the stevia pilot project include purchase of 
test varieties of stevia plants, reimbursement of direct and indirect costs 
incurred by our test grower during the pilot production period, research and 
development costs related to varietal breeding and modifications to our 
facility to accommodate desiccation and bundling of stevia leaf. 

We will be repaying the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding 
promissory notes issued in connection with Seed Holding's purchase of S&W Seed
Company partnership interests in the principal amount of $730,000. Interest 
accrues on these notes at 4% per annum from December 1, 2009 as to $600,000 
and from December 31, 2009 as to the remaining $130,000. These payments are 
being made to the former partners of the Partnership, none of the whom is an 
executive officer, director or principal stockholder of our company. 

The net amount due to Triangle T Partners, LLC, a related party grower, is 
$360,241. This amount is the difference between the $434,509 we owe Triangle 
T for the alfalfa seed grown by Triangle T and the $74,268 Triangle T owes us
for seed it purchased from us to grow hay. 

Research and development expenditures are expected to include development of
GMO varieties crossed with our proprietary seed. 

Our plans to upgrade our seed-processing facility currently include the 
addition of a fourth cleaning line, which could be a dedicated GMO line, if we
choose to process GMO seed, and the addition of a seed-coating operation, 
which we may consider operating as a joint venture with an existing 
seed-coating company. 

Our general corporate expenses include general and administrative salaries,
accounting, legal and consulting fees, facilities expenses and other working 
capital needs, including payments to our growers. 

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities."

$15,391,125 if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, 
based on an initial public offering price of $11.00 per unit, and after 
deducting the estimated underwriting discount of $962,500 and estimated 
offering expenses (including the non-accountable expense allowance) of 
approximately $1,212,000 payable by us, together totaling approximately 
$2,174,500. 

We currently expect to allocate the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

Repay Wells Fargo Bank line of credit                    $  2,500,000   18.9 %
Fund stevia pilot program                                   1,000,000    7.6

Repay promissory notes issued for acquiring partnership

Buy out the remaining minority partnership interests in
S&W Seed Company                                              600,000    4.5
Pay net amount due to Triangle T Partners, LLC, a
related party grower and customer                             360,300    2.7
Research and development                                      300,000    2.3

General corporate and working capital purposes              6,210,200   47.0

Total                                                   $  13,225,500 100.00 % 
                  

A constraint on our ability to grow our sales to meet demand for our varieties 
of alfalfa seed has been our inability to carry large inventories for the 
extended periods of time dictated by the annual planting cycle. One of the 
principal reasons for this offering is to increase our working capital, 
thereby allowing us to aggressively market our alfalfa seed varieties, both 
domestically and internationally, since, ideally, we will have sufficient 
inventory to satisfy any demand created. 

By the time we close this offering, we will have drawn down the entire 
$2,500,000 available under our line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank and will 
pay off the principal and accrued interest in full upon completion of this 
offering. The principal bears interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal 
to 3% above the Daily One Month LIBOR (as defined in the Revolving Line of 
Credit Note) in effect from time to time, and the maturity date is April 1, 
2011. The line of credit continues to be secured by all of our rights to 
certain kinds of payments as set forth in the security agreement and our 
inventories and is subject to personal guarantees provided by certain of our 
related parties, among other guarantors. The proceeds from the line of credit 
have been used for working capital purposes, including making payments to our 
growers. 

Our anticipated expenditures on the stevia pilot project include purchase of 
test varieties of stevia plants, reimbursement of direct and indirect costs 
incurred by our test grower during the pilot production period, research and 
development costs related to varietal breeding and modifications to our 
facility to accommodate desiccation and bundling of stevia leaf. 

We will be repaying the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding 
promissory notes issued in connection with Seed Holding's purchase of S&W Seed
Company partnership interests in the principal amount of $730,000. Interest 
accrues on these notes at 4% per annum from December 1, 2009 as to $600,000 
and from December 31, 2009 as to the remaining $130,000. These payments are 
being made to the former partners of the Partnership, none of the whom is an 
executive officer, director or principal stockholder of our company. 

The net amount due to Triangle T Partners, LLC, a related party grower, is 
$360,241. This amount is the difference between the $434,509 we owe Triangle 
T for the alfalfa seed grown by Triangle T and the $74,268 Triangle T owes us
for seed it purchased from us to grow hay. 

Research and development expenditures are expected to include development of
GMO varieties crossed with our proprietary seed. 

Our plans to upgrade our seed-processing facility currently include the 
addition of a fourth cleaning line, which could be a dedicated GMO line, if we
choose to process GMO seed, and the addition of a seed-coating operation, 
which we may consider operating as a joint venture with an existing 
seed-coating company. 

Our general corporate expenses include general and administrative salaries,
accounting, legal and consulting fees, facilities expenses and other working 
capital needs, including payments to our growers. 

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities."

approximately $54.7 million, or $62.5 million if the underwriters exercise 
their over-allotment option in full, in each case after deducting underwriting 
discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not 
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders. 
  
We anticipate using the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate 
purposes, including incremental costs associated with being a public company, 
and for potential acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses or 
technologies that we believe will complement our current operations and 
expansion strategies. 
  
In addition, the purposes of this offering also include the retention of 
employees by providing them with equity incentives and the creation of a 
public market for our common shares represented by the ADSs for the benefit of 
our shareholders. We did not have any agreements or understandings to make any 
material acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses as of the date 
of this prospectus. 
  
The foregoing represents our intentions as of the date of this prospectus with 
respect of the use and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based 
upon our present plans and business conditions, but our management will have 
significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of the 
offering. The occurrence of unforeseen events or changed business conditions 
may result in application of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other 
than as described in this prospectus. 
  
To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not 
immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net 
proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, debt instruments or bank deposits. 
These investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal 
income tax consequences of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we 
may become a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could result in 
negative tax consequences for you. These consequences are described in more 
detail in “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Our ADSs and This 
Offering — We may become a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, which 
could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences to U.S. holders” and 
“Taxation — Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations — Passive 
Foreign Investment Company.” 
  
In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we, as an offshore holding 
company, are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to 
our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to other 
entities only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government 
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to 
our PRC subsidiaries or make additional capital contributions to our PRC 
subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot 
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or 
approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

stock in this offering and the sale of 2,941,176 shares of our common stock 
in the concurrent private placement will be approximately $234.3 million, at 
the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, and after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses that we must pay in connection with this offering. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by 
the selling stockholders, including any shares of common stock sold by the 
selling stockholders in connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their 
option to purchase additional shares of common stock, although we will bear 
the costs, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with
the sale of these shares. The selling stockholders may include certain of our 
executive officers and members of our board of directors or entities 
affiliated with or controlled by them. 

We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement to fund planned capital expenditures, working capital and
other general corporate purposes. Such uses may include the $33 million of 
costs related to the development of our Model S and our planned Model S 
manufacturing facility plus cost overruns as well as cost overruns we may 
encounter in developing our powertrain facility, which will not be funded by 
advances under our loan facility with the United States Department of Energy, 
or DOE Loan Facility. We expect to use a portion of this offering to fund such
amount. 

We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between 
$100 million and $125 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. These 
capital expenditures will include approximately $42 million to purchase our 
planned Tesla manufacturing facility for the Model S in Fremont, California, 
excluding any manufacturing equipment we may subsequently acquire. Our 
aggregate capital expenditures will also include funding the expansion of our 
Tesla stores. We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds to fund this 
expansion, which we estimate will cost approximately $5 million during the 
year ended December 31, 2010 and an additional $5 million to $10 million 
annually over the next several years thereafter to establish approximately 50 
stores globally. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to potentially 
expand our current business through acquisitions of complementary businesses, 
products or technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments 
for any specific acquisitions at this time. We may find it necessary or 
advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and subject to our 
obligations under our DOE Loan Facility, we will have broad discretion in the 
application of the net proceeds. 

We have agreed to set aside 50% of the net proceeds from this offering and 
the concurrent private placement, up to a maximum of $100 million, to fund 
a separate, dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility. This dedicated 
account can be used by us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and 
Model S manufacturing facility projects and will also be used as a mechanism 
to defer advances under the DOE Loan Facility. This will not affect our 
ability to draw down the full amount of the DOE loans, but will require us to 
use the dedicated account to fund certain project costs up front, which costs
may then be reimbursed by loans under the DOE Loan Facility once the dedicated
account is depleted, or as part of the final advance for the applicable 
project.

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the 
proceeds in highly liquid cash equivalents that are permitted under our DOE 
Loan Facility or United States government securities. 

Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public 
market for our common stock and increase our visibility in the marketplace. 
A public market for our common stock will facilitate future access to public 
equity markets and enhance our ability to use our common stock as a means of 
attracting and retaining key employees and as consideration for acquisitions 
or strategic transactions. Depending on the future demand for our products 
and the pace at which we expand our manufacturing capacity, we may seek to 
raise additional capital to fund our manufacturing expansion."

price of $17.00 per share. After deducting the underwriting discount and 
commissions and estimated expenses of this offering and the formation 
transactions, we expect net proceeds from this offering of approximately 
$190.5 million, or approximately $220.9 million if the underwriters’ 
overallotment option is exercised in full. The net proceeds we will receive in 
the concurrent private placement of our common stock will be $20.0 million. We 
will contribute the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private 
placement to our operating partnership in exchange for common units, and our 
operating partnership will use the proceeds as described below: 

   •  $115.0 million to repay in full mortgage indebtedness (including 
      principal and related accrued interest) secured by our Sunset Gower and 
      Technicolor Building properties, which bears interest at the London 
      Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 3.50% (subject to a cap on the 
      LIBOR portion of the interest rate of 4.75%), and was scheduled to mature
      on March 14, 2010 (management has executed a term sheet with the current 
      lenders to extend the maturity under this loan through March 14, 2011); 
 
   •  approximately $42.2 million to repay in full mortgage indebtedness 
      (including principal and related accrued interest) secured by the 875 
      Howard Street property, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% (subject
      to a cap on the LIBOR portion of the interest rate of not greater than 
      6.25%), and is scheduled to mature on February 13, 2011, with a one-year 
      extension option; 
 
   •  approximately $7.2 million to acquire interests in the First Financial 
      and Tierrasanta properties; 
 
   •  approximately $27.5 million to acquire the Del Amo Office property; and 
 
   •  up to $11.0 million (determined as of June 9, 2010) to fund the build-out
      and lease-up of the 875 Howard Street property. 
 
We expect to have approximately $7.7 million of remaining unapplied net 
proceeds upon completion of this offering and the concurrent private placement 
and consummation of the formation transactions (or $38.0 million if the 
underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full). In addition, to the 
extent we are unable to consummate the acquisition of the Del Amo Office 
property, we will have an additional $27.5 million of unapplied net proceeds. 
Any remaining net proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes, 
including funding capital expenditures, tenant improvements, leasing 
commissions, future acquisitions and, potentially, paying distributions and

$9,400,000 after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated offering 
expenses of $1,600,000 payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that we will receive additional net 
proceeds of approximately $1,490,000. 

Our current estimate of the use of the net proceeds from this offering is as 
follows:

(2)  We expect cost of revenue to include engagement of server farms, payment 
     of content royalties, and cost of billing services and short message 
     service (SMS) providers.  

(3)  We expect that general corporate and working capital expenditures will 
     include costs associated with being a public company, general working 
     capital and payments on a portion of our $5.0 million loan facility from 
     SVB/Gold Hill for the twelve months subsequent to the consummation of this
     offering. The loan facility bears interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum and
     an effective interest rate of 18%. In connection with the Bridge 
     Financing, we entered into a loan modification agreement whereby principal
     payments on the facility are deferred until the earlier of six months from
     the Bridge Financing or the consummation of this offering. Following the 
     recommencement of principal payments, the remaining portion of the loan 
     will be amortized over the period from the consummation of this offering 
     through March 1, 2013. Monthly payments of principal and interest 
     including approximately $1.68 million for the twelve months subsequent to 
     the consummation of this offering will be approximately $140,000 per 
     month.  

If we receive the additional net proceeds from the exercise of the over-
allotment option, we estimate that our use of the additional funds would be in 
a manner similar to the purposes and percentages described above. 

The allocation of the net proceeds of the offering set forth above represents 
our estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding industry 
and general economic conditions, our future revenues and expenditures. 

Investors are cautioned, however, that expenditures may vary substantially from
these estimates. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management, 
who will have broad discretion regarding the application of the proceeds of 
this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend 
upon numerous factors, including market conditions, cash generated by our 
operations, business developments and related rate of growth. We may find it 
necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for 
other purposes. 

Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds include: 

   •  the existence of other opportunities or the need to take advantage of 
      changes in timing of our existing activities; 
 
   •  the need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase or eliminate 
      existing initiatives due to, among other things, changing market 
      conditions and competitive developments; and/or 
 
   •  if strategic opportunities of which we are not currently aware present 
      themselves (including acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and other 
      similar transactions). 
 
From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate 
continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of 
resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being optimized. Pending
such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in direct and 
guaranteed obligations of the United States, interest-bearing, investment-grade
instruments or certificates of deposit."

dated as of August 26, 2008, and amended as of July 15, 2009 and November 
19, 2009. Loans drawn under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
are payable in a single maturity on December 31, 2010 and bear interest at
the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin that ranges between 1.75% and 
3.75% per annum depending on Higher One, Inc.’s funded debt to EBITDA ratio. 

We also intend to use $8.25 million of the net proceeds we receive from this
offering for certain post-closing costs related to our acquisition of CASHNet.
We do not have a current specific plan for the remaining net proceeds, which 
we intend to use for general corporate purposes. In addition to the uses set 
out above, the principal reason for our sale of shares of common stock in 
this offering is to raise funds so that we have resources available to pursue 
our strategic objectives, such as developing new products, enhancing and 
upgrading existing products and selectively considering strategic 
acquisitions and investments, which may be time sensitive, as and when 
opportunities present themselves."

approximately $40.0 million, or $46.1 million if the underwriters exercise 
their option to purchase additional shares from us in full, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the 
selling stockholders, although we will bear the costs, other than underwriting 
discounts and commissions, associated with those sales. 
  
We expect to use approximately $4.3 million of the net proceeds received by 
us in this offering to redeem and subsequently cancel all outstanding shares 
of our Series A redeemable preferred stock under the terms of our restated 
certificate of incorporation. We also intend to use approximately $14.3 
million of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding balance under the ORIX 
Loan. The ORIX Loan matures on September 26, 2013. The interest rate charged 
on the advances under the ORIX Loan is variable and was 7.0% per annum as of 
March 31, 2010. 
  
We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes, including expanding our 
development, operations, marketing and sales departments. We may also use 
a portion of the proceeds for the future acquisition of, or investment in, 
complementary businesses, products or technologies. However, we do not have 
agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time and we 
have not allocated specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes. 
  
Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net 
proceeds remaining after the redemption of our Series A redeemable preferred 
stock and repayment of the outstanding balance under the ORIX Loan, and 
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the 
application of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending these uses, we plan 
to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing obligations, 
investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed 
obligations of the United States. The goal with respect to the investment of 
these net proceeds is capital preservation and liquidity so that such funds
are readily available to fund our operations."

payable to the underwriters and our estimated offering expenses) from this 
offering will be approximately $258.6 million ($306.1 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to acquire additional shares from us in 
full.) We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of 
unrestricted common stock by the selling stockholders, which include certain
underwriters and their affiliates.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of unrestricted common 
stock by any selling stockholder in this offering. 

We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
two proposed tender offers for our outstanding Class A-1 and Class A-2 common 
stock. Certain underwriters and their affiliates that will own Class A-1 or 
Class A-2 common stock following this offering will be entitled to participate 
in the proposed tender offers. We currently anticipate that the aggregate 
dollar amount of the two tender offers, if fully subscribed, would roughly 
approximate the net proceeds from this offering. 

Until we use the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in short-term securities."

approximately $35,519,750 after deducting the underwriting discounts and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the $35,519,750

$15,000,000 of cash generated from our operations and the remainder of 
approximately $9,580,250 from bank loans, to complete the construction of 
Phase III at our Daqing facility. 

The foregoing estimates of the use of our net proceeds from this offering 
represent our current intentions based upon our present plans and business
condition. The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending on 
the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological
developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, 
our management will have significant discretion in the allocation of the net 
proceeds we will receive from this offering. Depending on future events and 
other changes in the business climate, we may determine at a later time to 
use the net proceeds for different purposes. Pending their use, we intend to 
place our net proceeds in short-term bank deposits. 

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, 
we are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our 
PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to 
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, 
we may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiaries or make additional 
capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital 
expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able
to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if 
at all."

exposure under the Corn Interest, and each party’s creditworthiness. In light

Treasury Securities, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will constitute
reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral 
requirements. All interest income will be used for the Fund’s benefit.

invest the Fund’s assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in 
short-term Treasury Securities, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these 
margin and collateral requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine
the percentage of assets that will be: 
  
   ·  held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other 
      custodians;  

   ·  used for other investments; and  

   ·  held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.  

In general, the Fund expects that it will be required to post between 5% and 
10% of the notional amount of a Corn Interest as initial margin when entering 
into such Corn Interest. Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally 
be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter Corn Interests based 
on changes in the value of the Corn Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral 
requirements with respect to over-the-counter Corn Interests are negotiated by 
the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of 
the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its
exposure under the Corn Interest, and each party’s creditworthiness. In light 
of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and 
over-the-counter Corn Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin 
and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of the 
Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The 
Treasury Securities, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will constitute
reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral 
requirements. All interest income will be used for the Fund’s benefit. 
  
A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a 
security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any 
positions held.

Contract and certain exchange traded Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, 
USBO is required to deposit with the futures commission merchant on behalf of 
the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as 
security to ensure payment for the obligation under Crude Oil Interests at 
maturity. This deposit is known as “margin.” USBO will invest the remainder 
of its assets equal to the difference between the margin deposited and the 
market value of the position in the Futures Contract in Treasuries, cash 
and/or cash equivalents. 

The General Partner expects that all entities that will hold or trade USBO’s
assets will be based in the United States and will be subject to United 
States regulations. 

The General Partner believes that 10% to 20% of USBO’s assets will normally 
be committed as margin for its positions in Futures Contracts. However, from 
time to time, the percentage of assets committed as margin may be 
substantially more, or less, than such range. The General Partner intends to 
invest the balance of USBO’s assets not invested in Crude Oil Interests or 
held in margin as reserves to be available for changes in margin. All 
interest income will be used for USBO’s benefit. 

The futures commission merchant, a government agency or a commodity exchange 
could increase margins applicable to USBO to hold trading positions at any 
time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the 
profit or loss potential for any positions taken. 

USBO’s assets will be held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity 
Exchange Act and CFTC regulations."
