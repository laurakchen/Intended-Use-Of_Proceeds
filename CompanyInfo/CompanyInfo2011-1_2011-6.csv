us in this offering, after deducting the underwriters’ discounts and 
commissions and estimated expenses incurred in connection with this offering, 
based on the offering price of $11.00 per share. If the underwriters fully 
exercise their over-allotment option, we expect to receive $345,123,455 of net 
proceeds. 
  
In addition, we expect to receive approximately $79 million of net proceeds 
from the sale of shares by us to Al Gharrafa in the Al Gharrafa Transaction, 
based on a price of $10.65 per share. 
  
We intend to use (i) approximately $230 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering and, assuming it is consummated, the Al Gharrafa Transaction to 
finance part of the construction costs of Ivinhema, our new sugar and ethanol 
mill in Brazil, (ii) approximately $145 million for potential investments in 
the acquisition of farmland and capital expenditures required in the expansion 
of our farming business, and (iii) the remainder, if any, for working capital 
and general corporate purposes. Pending the use of net proceeds for 
agricultural investments in accordance with our strategy, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds from this offering and, assuming it is consummated, the Al 
Gharrafa Transaction conservatively, concentrating mostly in liquid sovereign 
debt instruments and high-quality short-term debt obligations. The allocation 
of our investments will be influenced by prevailing market conditions from 
time to time. 

We currently estimate that we will need to invest $690 million to complete the 
construction of Ivinhema. In addition to the above-referenced portion of the 
proceeds from this offering and, assuming it is consummated, the Al Gharrafa 
Transaction, we plan to fund the remaining construction costs with additional 
indebtedness and cash from operations.It is likely that our actual capital 
expenditures may vary significantly from our current projections based on 
timing of investments and changes in market opportunities. While our business 
strategy currently contemplates the potential acquisition of farmland, we 
cannot predict the timing for any acquisition and the amount of consideration 
that will be paid therefor. In addition, expenditures in connection with the 
construction of our Ivinhema mill may vary from our current plan as a result 
of (i) engineering, construction and regulatory risks, such as obtaining 
necessary permits and licenses as well as other significant challenges that 
can suspend the construction or hinder or delay the project’s completion date 
and (ii) fluctuations in the Brazilian Real exchange rate, higher than 
expected inflation and the development of new technology resulting in changes 
or adjustments in the design of the mill, and other unforeseen factors that 
may generate significant cost overruns.We may also decide to reallocate our 
planned capital expenditures among our lines of business and from time to time 
based on market opportunities available to us. 
  
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common shares by the 
selling shareholders."

offering will be approximately $39.6 million at the initial public offering 
price of $10.50 per ADS assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ 
overallotment option and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses that we must pay. If the 
underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that we 
will receive additional net proceeds of approximately $8.8 million. We will 
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by any selling shareholder. 

We intend to use approximately $24.5 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering to finance the remaining construction of our second fab. We also 
intend to use the net proceeds to repay some or all of our outstanding loan, 
amounting to $6.0 million, with the Agricultural Bank of China, or ABC, which 
bears an interest rate of 5.04% as of September 30, 2010 and is due in April 
2011. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including marketing, 
research and development and capital expenditures. In addition, we may choose 
to expand our current business through acquisitions of other businesses, 
products or technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments 
for any specific acquisitions at this time. The amounts and timing of any 
expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash generated by our 
operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, 
if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant 
flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering. 

Pending use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds 
generally in term deposits and cash."

discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us, will be 
approximately $1,560 million (or $1,795 million if the underwriters exercise

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the concurrent offering of

be approximately $240 million if completed (or $277 million if the 
underwriters of the concurrent offering of Mandatory Convertible Subordinated 
Bonds exercise their option to purchase additional Mandatory Convertible 
Subordinated Bonds in full). 

We intend to use the anticipated net proceeds of both offerings as follows: 

•  approximately $195 million of the net proceeds will be applied to redeem 
approximately $163 million in aggregate principal amount (approximately $175

all or a portion of their option to purchase additional shares of our common 
stock or the underwriters in our offering of Mandatory Convertible 
Subordinated Bonds exercise all or a portion of their option to purchase 
additional Mandatory Convertible Subordinated Bonds, the net proceeds received

stock in this offering will be approximately $66.5 million, based upon the 
initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, and after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses that we must pay in connection with this offering. 

If the underwriters option to purchase additional shares in this offering is 
exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately 
$77.2 million, based upon the initial public offering price of $17.00 per 
share, and after deducting estimated underwriter discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses that we must pay in connection with this 
offering. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by 
the selling stockholders, including any shares of common stock sold by the 
selling stockholders in connection with the underwriters' exercise of their 
option to purchase additional shares of common stock, although we will bear 
the costs, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with 
the sale of these shares. The selling stockholders may include certain of our 
executive officers and members of our board of directors or entities 
affiliated with or controlled by them. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for investments in 
content, international expansion, working capital, product development, sales 
and marketing activities, general and administrative matters and capital 
expenditures. We currently anticipate that our aggregate investments in 
content during the year ending December 31, 2011 will range from $50 million 
to $75 million. We intend to fund a portion of these estimated investments 
with the proceeds of the offering, although as of the date of this prospectus, 
we cannot estimate the amount of net proceeds that will be used for the other 
purposes described above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures, 
including content investments, will depend on numerous factors, including data 
supporting our predicted internal rates of return, the status of our product 
development efforts, our sales and marketing activities, the amount of cash 
generated or used by our operations, and competitive pressures. We believe 
that we will be able to fund our content investments and other expenditures 
described above through 2011 with our cash flow from operations, our existing 
cash balances and the availability under our revolving credit facility and 
without using the net proceeds from this offering. In addition, as discussed 
under ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Company—We have made and may make 
additional acquisitions that could entail significant execution, integration 
and operational risks,"" we may consider making acquisitions in the future to 
increase the scope of our business domestically and internationally. Our 
management will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds in 
this offering, including the discretion to utilize such proceeds for one or 
more acquisitions. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities 
such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and 
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. 

Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public 
market for our common stock and increase our visibility in the marketplace. 
A public market for our common stock will facilitate future access to public 
equity markets and enhance our ability to use our common stock as a means of 
attracting and retaining key employees and as consideration for acquisitions 
or strategic transactions."

by us, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $12,050,000 from 
this offering if the minimum offering is sold and $14,580,000 if the maximum 
offering is sold. 

We do not have, at this time, a definitive plan to use the proceeds of the 
offering in particular ways. Generally, we intend to use the net proceeds of 
this offering to support and expand YSTP’s operations, with particular 
priority to efforts to expand its production and marketing capabilities as 
well as to strengthen and expand our distribution network. The precise 
amounts and percentage of proceeds we would devote to particular categories 
of activity will depend not only on the total amount of proceeds we generate 
in the offering, but also on prevailing market and business conditions as well 
as on the nature of particular opportunities that may arise from time to time. 
Similarly, the priority of our prospective uses of proceeds will depend on 
business and market conditions are they develop. Accordingly, we reserve the 
right to change the use of proceeds that we presently anticipate.

Nonetheless, based on our preliminary planning, we anticipate that the 
proceeds of a minimum and a maximum offering would be allocated to major 
categories of expense in approximately the following amounts:

Our present intent is to allocate relatively higher shares of offering 
proceeds, in the event the offering generates less the maximum proceeds, to 
working capital, distributor advances, and production equipment upgrades. 
Regardless of the amount of proceeds generated, however, the category of 
activity to which we presently plan to devote the largest single share of 
proceeds is to efforts to build our distribution network. 

Our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the 
net proceeds received by us. We reserve the right to re-allocate funds 
tentatively allocated to that purpose to our general working capital. If 
that were to happen, then our management would have significant discretion 
over even more of the net proceeds to be received by our company in this 
offering. You will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment 
decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. You 
must rely on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the 
net proceeds of this offering. The net proceeds may be used for corporate 
purposes that do not improve our efforts to achieve profitability or increase 
our stock price. The net proceeds from this offering may be placed in 
investments that do not produce income or that lose value. 

The proceeds of this offering must be sent back to the China, and the process 
for sending such proceeds back to the China may take several months after the 
closing of this offering. In utilizing the proceeds of this offering in the 
manner described above, as an offshore holding company of our PRC operating 
subsidiaries, we may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or we may make 
additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. Any loans to our 
PRC subsidiaries are subject to PRC regulations. For example, loans by us to 
our subsidiaries in China, which are foreign-invested enterprises, to finance 
their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with 
the SAFE. 

We may also decide to finance our subsidiaries by means of capital 
contributions. These capital contributions must be approved by the PRC 
Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. We cannot assure you that we 
will be able to obtain these government approvals on a timely basis, if at 
all, with respect to future capital contributions by us to our subsidiaries. 
If we fail to receive such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds of this 
offering and to capitalize our Chinese operations may be negatively affected, 
which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand 
our business. 

The remittance procedures could take as long as six months to complete. 
Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in 
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments 
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences 
of an investment in our common shares. It is possible that we may become a 
passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers, which 
could result in negative tax consequences to you."

corresponding Index through each respective Fund’s portfolio of exchange 
traded futures contracts on its underlying Index Futures Contracts, plus the 
excess, if any, of its interest income from its holdings of United States 
Treasury and other high credit quality short-term fixed income securities over
the expenses of each Fund. If and when necessary, a Fund may invest in 
Substitute Futures and Financial Instruments, as applicable. Each Fund’s 
holdings of United States Treasury and other high credit quality short-term 
fixed income securities will be deposited with such Fund’s Commodity Broker as
margin. 

To the extent, if any, that a Fund trades in futures contracts on United States
exchanges, the assets deposited by such Fund with its Commodity Broker as 
margin must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such 
segregated funds may be invested only in a limited range of instruments — 
principally U.S. government obligations. 

To the extent, if any, that a Fund trades in futures on markets other than 
regulated United States futures exchanges, funds deposited to margin positions 
held on such exchanges will be invested in bank deposits or in instruments of 
a credit standing generally comparable to those authorized by the CFTC for 
investment of “customer segregated funds,” although applicable CFTC rules 
prohibit funds employed in trading on foreign exchanges from being deposited 
in “customer segregated fund accounts.” 

Although the percentages set forth below may vary substantially over time, as 
of the date of this Prospectus, each Fund estimates: 

(i)  up to approximately 30–40% of the net asset value of each Fund is placed 
     in segregated accounts in the name of such Fund with the Commodity Broker 
     (or another eligible financial institution, as applicable) in the form of 
     cash or 3-month U.S. Treasury bills and other high credit quality short-
     term fixed income securities to margin positions of all futures contracts 
     combined. Such funds are segregated pursuant to CFTC rules; 

(ii) the remainder of the net asset value of each Fund is maintained in 
     segregated accounts in the name of such Fund in bank deposits or United 
     States Treasury and United States Government Agencies issues. 

Should a Fund invest in Financial Instruments, such Fund will deposit 
collateral with the relevant counterparties in order to establish and maintain 
positions in the Financial Instruments. The collateral will be held in U.S. 
government securities or in cash, for which the applicable Fund will receive 
interest credits at short-term rates. The Financial Instrument counterparties 
may receive a benefit as a result of the deposit of such collateral in the form
of a reduction in their outstanding overnight borrowing, despite the fact that 
the collateral belongs to the applicable Fund, not the Financial Instrument 
counterparty. The Managing Owner expects that the amount of collateral 
deposited with the relevant counterparty with respect to a position in one or 
more Financial Instruments (if applicable) will be determined in accordance 
with normal practices in the over-the-counter derivatives markets. 

The Managing Owner, a registered commodity pool operator, is responsible for 
the cash management activities of each Fund, including investing in United 
States Treasury and United States Government Agencies issues. 

In addition, assets of each Fund not required to margin positions may be 
maintained in United States bank accounts opened in the name of such Fund and 
may be held in United States Treasury bills (or other securities approved by 
the CFTC for investment of customer funds).

corresponding Index through each respective Fund’s portfolio of exchange 
traded futures contracts on its underlying Index Futures Contracts, plus the 
excess, if any, of its interest income from its holdings of United States 
Treasury and other high credit quality short-term fixed income securities 
over the expenses of each Fund. If and when necessary, a Fund may invest in 
Substitute Futures and Financial Instruments, as applicable. Each Fund’s 
holdings of United States Treasury and other high credit quality short-term 
fixed income securities will be deposited with such Fund’s Commodity Broker 
as margin. 

To the extent, if any, that a Fund trades in futures contracts on United 
States exchanges, the assets deposited by such Fund with its Commodity Broker 
as margin must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such 
segregated funds may be invested only in a limited range of instruments — 
principally U.S. government obligations. 

To the extent, if any, that a Fund trades in futures on markets other than 
regulated United States futures exchanges, funds deposited to margin positions
held on such exchanges will be invested in bank deposits or in instruments 
of a credit standing generally comparable to those authorized by the CFTC for 
investment of “customer segregated funds,” although applicable CFTC rules 
prohibit funds employed in trading on foreign exchanges from being deposited 
in “customer segregated fund accounts.” 

Although the percentages set forth below may vary substantially over time, 
as of the date of this Prospectus, each Fund estimates: 

(i) up to approximately 30–40% of the net asset value of each Fund is placed 
in segregated accounts in the name of such Fund with the Commodity Broker 
(or another eligible financial institution, as applicable) in the form of 
cash or 3-month U.S. Treasury bills and other high credit quality short-term 
fixed income securities to margin positions of all 

futures contracts combined. Such funds are segregated pursuant to CFTC rules; 

(ii) the remainder of the net asset value of each Fund is maintained in 
segregated accounts in the name of such Fund in bank deposits or United States
Treasury and United States Government Agencies issues. 

Should a Fund invest in Financial Instruments, such Fund will deposit 
collateral with the relevant counterparties in order to establish and maintain
positions in the Financial Instruments. The collateral will be held in U.S. 
government securities or in cash, for which the applicable Fund will receive 
interest credits at short-term rates. The Financial Instrument counterparties 
may receive a benefit as a result of the deposit of such collateral in the 
form of a reduction in their outstanding overnight borrowing, despite the 
fact that the collateral belongs to the applicable Fund, not the Financial 
Instrument counterparty. The Managing Owner expects that the amount of 
collateral deposited with the relevant counterparty with respect to 
a position in one or more Financial Instruments (if applicable) will be 
determined in accordance with normal practices in the over-the-counter
 derivatives markets. 

The Managing Owner, a registered commodity pool operator, is responsible for
the cash management activities of each Fund, including investing in United 
States Treasury and United States Government Agencies issues. 

In addition, assets of each Fund not required to margin positions may be
maintained in United States bank accounts opened in the name of such Fund 
and may be held in United States Treasury bills (or other securities approved 
by the CFTC for investment of customer funds).

certain Other Oil Interests that are exchange-traded, the Fund will be 
required to deposit with the futures commission merchant on behalf of the

to ensure payment for the obligation under the Oil Interests at maturity.  
This deposit is known as initial margin.  Counterparties in transactions in

TEUCRIUM COMMODITY TRUST,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/teucrium-commodity-trust-812164-64495,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/teucrium-commodity-trust-812164-64495,424B3,1/4/2011,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7636980,"The Sponsor will cause the Fund to transfer the proceeds of the sale of 
Creation Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading 
activities.  The Sponsor will invest the Fund’s assets in Oil Futures 
Contracts , Cleared Oil Swaps and Other Oil Interests, Treasury Securities, 
cash and cash equivalents.  When the Fund purchases Oil Futures Contracts and 
certain Other Oil Interests that are exchange-traded, the Fund will be 
required to deposit with the futures commission merchant on behalf of the 
exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security 
to ensure payment for the obligation under the Oil Interests at maturity.  
This deposit is known as initial margin.  Counterparties in transactions in 
Cleared Oil Swaps and over-the-counter Oil Interests will generally impose 
similar collateral requirements on the Fund.  The Sponsor will invest the 
Fund’s assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in Treasury 
Securities, cash and/or cash equivalents.Subject to these margin and 
collateral requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine the 
percentage of assets that will be: 

   ·  held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other 
      custodians;  

   ·  used for other investments; and  

   ·  held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.  

In general, the Fund expects that it will be required to post between 5% and 
10% of the notional amount of an Oil Interest as initial margin when entering 
into such Oil Interest. Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally 
be required for both exchange-traded and over-the-counter Oil Interests based 
on changes in the value of the Oil Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral 
requirements with respect to over-the-counter Oil Interests are negotiated by 
the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of 
the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge 
its exposure under the Oil Interest, and each party’s creditworthiness. In 
light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded 
and over-the-counter Oil Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing 
margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of 
the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. 
The Treasury Securities, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will 
constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and 
collateral requirements. All interest income will be used for the Fund’s 
benefit. 

A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time.  Moreover, margin is merely a 
security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any 
positions held. 

The Fund’s assets will be held in segregation pursuant to the Commodity 
Exchange Act and CFTC regulations."

(1)  Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem 
     their shares in connection with our successful consummation of our 
     initial business combination.  
(2)  In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the 
     proceeds of a $225,000 loan from sponsor, as described in this 
     prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon consummation of this offering 
     out of the approximately $1.1 million of offering proceeds that has been 
     allocated for the payment of offering expenses (excluding the 
     underwriting discounts). In the event that offering expenses are less 
     than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for 
     post-closing working capital expenses.

(3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $3.1 million of 
     their underwriting commissions (or approximately $3.6 million if the 
     underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which equals 
     2.5% of the gross proceeds from the units offered to the public, until 
     consummation of our initial business combination. Upon consummation of 
     our initial business combination, approximately $3.1 million, which 
     constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or approximately 
     $3.6 million if the underwriters’ over allotment option is exercised in 
     full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust 
     account, and the remaining funds will be released to us.  
(4)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or 
     all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
     example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our 
     current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a 
     business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
     combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a 
     specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
     additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the 
     engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may 
     vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist 
     with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change 
     in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the 
     current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the 
     extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of 
     expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount of 
     interest available to us from the trust account may be less than $2.0 
     million as a result of the current interest rate environment.  

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to 
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a 
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our 
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account 
that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, 
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital. 

A total of approximately $124.4 million (or approximately $143.0 million if 
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net 
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in 
this prospectus, including approximately $3.1 million (or approximately $3.6 
million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of 
deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account at J.P. 
Morgan Chase Bank, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 
as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a 
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain 
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for a 
portion of the interest income that may be released to us to pay any income 
and franchise taxes and to fund our working capital requirements, as 
discussed below, and any amounts necessary to purchase up to 25% of our 
public shares, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released 
until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination and 
the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a 
business combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering 
(subject to the requirements of law). 

If we elect to increase the initial amount held in the trust account from 
approximately $9.95 per unit, such increase would be funded by an increase in 
the amount of the deferral of the underwriting commissions payable in 
connection with this offering, an increase in the number of sponsor warrants 
to be purchased by our sponsor at a price of $0.75 per warrant and/or a
reduction from the $1.0 million initially available to us for working capital 
that is not held in the trust account. Public stockholders would own a 
smaller percentage of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
to the extent that our sponsor purchases additional warrants. 

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account, as well as the 
interest income of up to $2.0 million, subject to adjustment, earned on the 
trust account balance (net of franchise and income taxes payable) that may be 
released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay 
the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is 
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a 
target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to 
undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the 
relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a 
letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a
business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking 
in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the 
actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to use 
from the trust account is less than $2.0 million as a result of the current 
interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, 
the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In 
this event, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional 
investments from members of our management team, but such members of our
management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest 
in, us. To the extent that the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option, the maximum amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust 
account will proportionately increase. In addition, if the size of this 
offering is increased or decreased, it would result in a proportionate 
increase or decrease in the amount of interest we may withdraw from the trust 
account. We will use such a proportionate increase in interest income to 
cover our working capital expenses. While we currently do not know what our 
future working capital expenses will be and while they will not necessarily 
be proportionate to the size of the offering, we believe that any additional 
interest income released to us would facilitate our ability to finance the 
exploration and consideration of a greater number of potential acquisition 
targets. 

Commencing on the date our securities are first quoted on the OTCBB, we have 
agreed to pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, 
administrative services and secretarial support. This arrangement is being 
agreed to by sponsor for our benefit and is not intended to provide sponsor 
compensation in lieu of salary or other remuneration to Mr. Johnson. We 
believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained 
from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our initial business 
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. 

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced to us a total of 
$225,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These 
advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due 60 days following 
the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of 
this offering out of the approximately $1.1 million of offering proceeds that
has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses (excluding the 
underwriting discounts). 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the 
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the 
working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned 
amounts, other than the interest on such proceeds that may be released to us 
for working capital purposes. Such loans may be convertible into founders 
shares or warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of 
$0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be 
identical to the sponsor warrants. None of the sponsor warrants, any shares 
of common stock issuable upon exercise thereof or the founders shares will 
have recourse to the proceeds held in our trust account. The terms of such 
loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no 
written agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we 
do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules in connection 
with our business combination, prior to the consummation of our initial 
business combination, there could be released to us from the trust account 
amounts necessary to purchase up to 25% of the shares sold in this offering 
(3,125,000 shares, or 3,593,750 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option is exercised in full). These purchases could occur at any time 
commencing after the filing of a preliminary proxy statement for our initial 
business combination and ending on the record date for the stockholder 
meeting to approve the initial business combination. Purchases will be made 
only in open market transactions at times when we are not in possession of 
any material non-public information and may not be made during a restricted 
period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. It is intended that 
purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, at prices 
(inclusive of commissions) not to exceed the per-share amount then held in 
the trust account (approximately $9.95 per share). We can purchase any or 
all of the 3,125,000 shares (or 3,593,750 shares if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) we are entitled to purchase. It 
will be entirely in our discretion as to how many shares are purchased.

Purchasing decisions will be made based on various factors, including the 
then-current market price of our common stock and the terms of the proposed 
business combination. All shares purchased by us will be immediately 
cancelled. Such open market purchases, if any, would be conducted by us to 
minimize any disparity between the then-current market price of our common 
stock and the per-share amount held in the trust account. A market price 
below the per-share trust amount could provide an incentive for purchasers to 
buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary proxy statement at a 
discount to the per-share amount held in the trust account for the sole 
purpose of voting against our initial business combination and exercising 
redemption rights for the full per-share amount held in the trust account. 
Such trading activity could enable such investors to block a business 
combination regardless of its merits by making it difficult to obtain the 
approval of such business combination by the vote of a majority of the 
outstanding shares of common stock voted. 

If we hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination 
and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules in 
connection with our business combination, we may enter into privately 
negotiated transactions to purchase public shares from stockholders after 
consummation of the initial business combination with proceeds from our 
trust account. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their 
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions.
Neither we nor our directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will 
make any such purchases when we or they are in possession of any material 
non-public information not disclosed to the seller. Although we do not 
currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public 
shares, in the event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in the best 
interest of those stockholders not receiving any such additional 
consideration. In addition, the payment of a premium may not be in the best 
interest of the remaining stockholders, who will experience a reduction in 
book value per share compared to the value received by stockholders that 
have their shares purchased by us at a premium. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause 
our stockholders’ equity to be less than $5,000,001. If we enter into an 
acquisition agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing 
condition to our initial business combination that we maintain a minimum net 
worth or certain amount of cash that is substantially greater than 
$5,000,001, we will communicate the details of the closing condition to our 
public stockholders through our tender offer or proxy solicitation 
materials, as applicable. Our articles of incorporation require us to provide 
all of our stockholders with an opportunity to redeem all of their shares in 
connection with the consummation of any initial business combination. 
Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would 
cause our stockholders’ equity to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater 
amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would 
not proceed with such redemption or the related business combination and may 
instead search for an alternate business combination. 

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not 
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested by 
the trustee only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 
days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Because the investment of the 
proceeds will be restricted to these instruments, we believe we will meet 
the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under 
the Investment Company Act. Interest income of up to $2.0 million, subject 
to adjustment, on the trust account balance (net of franchise and income 
taxes payable) may be released to us from the trust account to fund a 
portion of our working capital requirements. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust 
account only upon the earlier to occur of our consummation of an initial 
business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our 
common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to 
the restrictions described in this prospectus, and the redemption of our 
public shares if we are unable to consummate an initial business combination
within 21 months from the closing of this offering. In no other circumstances 
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the 
trust account. 

Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with 
respect to their shares in connection with the consummation of a business 
combination. In addition, initial stockholders have agreed to waive their 
redemption rights with respect to their founder shares if we fail to 
consummate a business combination within 21 months from the closing of this 
offering. However, if our initial stockholders, or any of our officers, 
directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering, 
they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public
shares if we fail to consummate a business combination within the required 
time period."

will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately US$36.8 million 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from 
the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering primarily for 
the following purposes: 

•  approximately 35% to expand our network of directly operated flagship 
   stores in China; 


•  approximately 35% to support our distributors in opening new Zuoan retail 
   stores; 


•  approximately 24% to establish a logistics center in Shishi for the purpose 
   of stocking our finished products; and 


•  the remaining amount to fund working capital and for other general 
   corporate purposes. 

In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, under 
PRC laws and regulations, we are permitted to provide funding to our PRC 
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to 
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, 
we may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiaries or make additional 
capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital 
expenditures or working capital. We intend to invest the proceeds of this 
offering into our PRC subsidiaries and thereafter convert such proceeds into 
Renminbi promptly upon completion of relevant PRC government registration or 
receipt of the relevant approval. If we provide funding to a PRC subsidiary 
through capital contribution or loans, we will need to increase the PRC 
subsidiary's approved registered capital and total investment amount, which 
requires approval from the MOC or its local counterparts. Such approval 
process typically takes 30 to 90 days, and sometimes longer, from the time the 
MOC receives the application documents. If we provide funding to a PRC 
subsidiary through loans, we will also need to register such loans with SAFE, 
which usually requires no more than 20 working days to complete. We cannot 
assure you that we will be able to complete these government registrations or 
obtain the relevant approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in short-
term, interest-bearing debt instruments or bank deposits. 

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and 
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans 
and business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility 
and discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The occurrence 
of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application 
of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this 
prospectus."

are offering will be approximately $35.6 million, based on the initial public 
offering price of $5.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts

underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase additional shares in this 
offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately $41.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

The costs and timing of drug development and marketing approval, particularly 
conducting clinical trials, are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial 
risks and can often change. Accordingly, we may change the allocation of use 
of these proceeds as a result of contingencies such as the progress and 
results of our clinical trials and other development activities, the 
establishment of collaborations, our manufacturing requirements and regulatory 
or competitive developments. 

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade 
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of 
the United States government."

of Agri-Energy in September 2010, at which time Agri-Energy became a 
subsidiary of Gevo Development, and we do not have agreements or commitments 
for any other specific acquisitions at this time. A portion of the net 
proceeds of this offering may be used to complete the retrofit of 
Agri-Energy’s ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota. We may also 
use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to fund working capital and 
other general corporate purposes, which may include paying off certain of our 
long-term debt obligations, expenses associated with litigation and the costs 
associated with being a public company.

two-fifths of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.    Other than as 
indicated in this Use of Proceeds section, we cannot specify with certainty 
the exact amounts that will be used for each purpose. The amounts and timing 
of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the 
status of our development efforts, sales and marketing activities, the amount 
of cash generated or used by our operations and competition. We may find it 
necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds for other purposes, and
we will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds. We have 
no current intentions to acquire any other businesses. Pending these uses, the

Circular 142 promulgated by SAFE regulates the conversion of foreign currency 
into Renminbi by a foreign-invested company like CD Media Huizhou and
restricts how the converted Renminbi may be used. To the extent that we need 
to convert the net proceeds of this offering that has been injected in the 
registered capital of CD Media Huizhou into Renminbi, we will be subject to 
the restrictions of Circular 142. Pursuant to Circular 142, the registered 
capital of a foreign-invested company, like CD Media Huizhou, settled in 
Renminbi converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes 
within the business license approved by the applicable governmental authority 
and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. Although, the scope
of CD Media Huizhou’s business license is limited, the providing of financing 
activities by CD Media Huizhou to CD Media Beijing would not be regarded as 
outside the scope of CD Media Huizhou’s business license because such 
financing activities are consistent with various forms of commercial and 
business cooperation transactions that are in compliance with the business 
scope of both CD Media Huizhou and CD Media Beijing. CD Media Huizhou’s 
financing transactions with CD Media Beijing to fund CD Media Beijing’s 
advertising activities would not cause CD Media Huizhou to engage in or 
conduct advertising activities outside the scope of its license. In addition, 
the use of such registered capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval,
and may not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of 
such loans have not been used. We intend to convert most of the proceeds of 
the offering in Renminbi in order to use them in our operations in the PRC as 
described above.

Some of the proceeds from this offering may be invested in CD Media Huizhou as
a “shareholder loan,” up to an amount equal to the total investment amount for
CD Media Huizhou approved by the relevant PRC government authority less the 
total approved registered capital of CD Media Huizhou. Shareholder loans
shall be registered with SAFE to become effective. Although Circular 142 does
not specifically subject shareholder loans to its limitations and restrictions
of conversion and usage of foreign currency, in practice, SAFE would apply 
such limitations and restrictions as principle in granting the registration 
of shareholder loans and therefore limit and restrict the usage of shareholder
loans registered with SAFE. Currently, because the total investment amount for
CD Media Huizhou is approximately $2,577,320, we are currently not able to 
make any shareholder loans to CD Media Huizhou. We are currently in the 
process of applying for an updated total approved investment amount and 
registered capital amount of HK$100,000,000 (approximately $12,879,958) and 
HK $60,000,000 (approximately $7,727,975), respectively, which will allow us 
to make shareholder loans. All proceeds invested as registered capital and/or 
as a shareholder loan to CD Media Huizhou can be used by the company for its 
business purposes.

If the application for the increase of the approved investment amount and 
registered capital amount of CD Media Huizhou is not approved by the competent 
authority, we may not be able to bring the proceeds of this offering into 
China by making a contribution to the registered capital of CD Media Huizhou 
or extending any foreign exchange shareholder loans to CD Media Huizhou, 
which are the two most efficient methods for bringing the proceeds into China 
from a cost, tax and time standpoint. It is very unlikely that such 
application will not be approved by the competent authority because there 
are no specific prohibitions to increasing the approved investment amount 
and registered capital amount of CD Media Huizhou under PRC law which would 
cause such application to be rejected by the competent authority. One factor 
that the competent authority will consider in granting the approval is 
whether the applied amounts match the needs of the business development of 
CD Media Huizhou. We believe that CD Media Huizhou has established 
a reasonable and justified application for an increase in its registered 
capital and approved investment amount based on its business needs and 
there is little chance that the application will be rejected on this basis. 
If the application is not approved, the Company could bring the proceeds into
China by setting up other companies similar to CD Media Huizhou and then 
having those companies enter into financing/commercial relationships with 
CD Media Beijing. The formation of such financing/commercial relationships 
with CD Media Beijing may increase our tax burdens in China.

the following purposes: 

 # approximately $15.0 million to fund the commercial launch of our lead 
   product, BGM Galectin-3, including establishing a commercial organization

 # the remainder for other general corporate purposes, including capital

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts 
and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
success of our commercialization efforts for our galectin-3 test; the timing 
and progress of our development activities for additional indications for our
galectin-3 test and our other product candidates, AMIPredict and LipidDx; the 
results of our discovery activities for our cardiovascular and other projects; 
and the timing and revenue derived from additional collaborations that we may 
enter into with third parties for our product candidates. The costs and timing 
of product discovery and development activities, particularly conducting 
clinical studies and obtaining regulatory clearance, are highly uncertain, 
subject to substantial risks and can often change. Depending on the outcome of 
these activities, our plans and priorities may change, and we may apply the net
proceeds from this offering differently than we currently anticipate. For 
example, in the event we identify other opportunities that we believe are in 
the best interest of our stockholders, we may use a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, 
products or companies that complement our business, although we have no current
understandings, commitments or agreements to do so. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this

second phase 3 clinical trial or obtain final OS data from PROCEED, the net 
proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient for such purposes. We will 
require additional funding through either collaboration arrangements, 
borrowings or sales of additional securities to commercialize any of our SMDCs 
or companion imaging diagnostics. We may use a portion of our net proceeds to 
acquire complementary products, technologies or businesses. We currently have 
no agreements or commitments to complete any such transactions and are not 
involved in negotiations to do so. We intend to use the remainder of our net 
proceeds, if any, for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
  
As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the 
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering. The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several 
factors, including cash flows from our operations and the anticipated growth 
of our business. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the 
application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment 
of our management regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering.
We reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of certain
contingencies such as the results of our development efforts, competitive 
developments, opportunities to acquire products, technologies or businesses or
other factors. 
  
Pending use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-
term, investment-grade and interest-bearing instruments."

$37.3 million if our existing principal stockholders and their affiliated 
entities purchase an aggregate of $7.5 million of shares of common stock in 
this offering because no underwriting discounts and commissions are applicable
to the purchase of such shares), or approximately $42.6 million (or $43.1 
million if our existing principal stockholders and their affiliated entities 
purchase an aggregate of $7.5 million of shares of common stock in this 
offering because no underwriting discounts and commissions are applicable to
the purchase of such shares) if the underwriters exercise their option to 
purchase additional shares from us in full, in each case based on the initial 
public offering price of $7.00 per share and after deducting the applicable 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

• approximately $36.0 million through the fourth quarter of 2011 for the
  planned manufacture and commercialization of EXPAREL in the United States;
  and 
 
• the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which
  may include the acquisition or licensing of other products or technologies 
  or the acquisition of other businesses in the biotechnology or specialty
  pharmaceuticals industry. 
 
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly 
depending on numerous factors, including: 

• the timing and outcome of the FDA’s review of the NDA for EXPAREL; 
 
• the extent to which the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical
  trials for EXPAREL; 
 
• the timing and success of this offering; 
 
• the costs of our commercialization activities for EXPAREL, if it is approved
  by the FDA; 
 
• the cost and timing of expanding our manufacturing facilities and purchasing 
  manufacturing and other capital equipment for EXPAREL and our other product
  candidates; 
 
• the scope, progress, results and costs of development for additional
  indications for EXPAREL and for our other product candidates; 
 
• the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our other product
  candidates; 
 
• the extent to which we acquire or invest in products, businesses and 
  technologies; 
 
• the extent to which we choose to establish collaboration, co-promotion,
  distribution or other similar agreements for product candidates; 
 
• the costs of preparing, submitting and prosecuting patent applications
  and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property claims; and 
 
• any unforeseen or underestimated cash needs. 
 

We therefore cannot estimate the amount of net proceeds to be used for all of 
the purposes described above. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the
net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the 
application of net proceeds. 

Following this offering, we believe that our available funds will be 
sufficient to complete the development of EXPAREL through FDA approval and 
to fund the expected commercial launch of EXPAREL in the United States in the 
fourth quarter of 2011. It is possible that we will not achieve the progress 
that we expect with respect to EXPAREL because the actual costs, timing of 
development and regulatory approval are difficult to predict and are subject 
to substantial risks and delays. We have no committed external sources of 
funds. To the extent that the net proceeds from this offering and our other 
capital resources are insufficient to complete clinical development of, 
obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, commercially launch 
EXPAREL, we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private
equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaboration and licensing 
arrangements or other financing alternatives. 

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

approximately $149.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and the 
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their 
overallotment option in full, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds 
of approximately $172.8 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering: 

• to repay all of the existing indebtedness under our notes payable, including
  accrued interest thereon, payable of approximately €84.0 million as of 
  October 3, 2010, or $115.2 million at the exchange rate at that date; and 

• for general corporate purposes. 

The notes payable we intend to repay are (i) the €37,000,000 promissory note 
due March 31, 2014, issued pursuant to a loan note instrument, dated April 3, 
2009, between us and certain shareholders named therein; and (ii) the 
€34,500,000 promissory note due February 28, 2013, issued pursuant to a loan 
note instrument, dated February 29, 2008, between us and certain shareholders 
named therein. The notes carry a fixed interest rate of 8.0% per annum with 
interest payments accrued in kind semi-annually. The carrying amount of the 
notes at October 3, 2010 is $81.5 million, which consists of $115.2 million 
in principal and accrued interest, net of unamortized discount of $33.7 
million. In connection with the repayment of our notes payable, we will 
recognize the remaining balance of unamortized discount and record a charge 
in the same amount to our statement of operations. The following table 
identifies our affiliates that hold notes and the amounts they own. We intend
to repay these note amounts, plus any accrued interest thereon, with a portion
of the proceeds from this offering:

Contracts, Cleared Natural Gas Swaps and Other Natural Gas Interests, Treasury
Securities, cash and cash equivalents.  When the Fund purchases Natural Gas 
Futures Contracts and certain Other Natural Gas Interests that are 
exchange-traded, the Fund will be required to deposit with the futures 
commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the
contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation
under the Natural Gas Interests at maturity.  This deposit is known as initial
margin.  Counterparties in transactions in Cleared Natural Gas Swaps and 
over-the-counter Natural Gas Interests will generally impose similar 
collateral requirements on the Fund.  The Sponsor will invest the Fund’s

Natural Gas Interests.  Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with 
respect to over-the-counter Natural Gas Interests are negotiated by the 
parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the 
underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its 
exposure under the Natural Gas Interest, and each party’s creditworthiness.  
In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under 
exchange-traded and over-the-counter Natural Gas Interests and the fluctuating
nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to 
estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or 
collateral at any given time.  The Treasury Securities, cash and cash 
equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available 
to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.  All interest income will 
be used for the Fund’s benefit.
 
A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time.  Moreover, margin is merely a

Creation Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading 
activities.  The Sponsor will invest the Fund’s assets in Natural Gas Futures 
Contracts, Cleared Natural Gas Swaps and Other Natural Gas Interests, Treasury
Securities, cash and cash equivalents.  When the Fund purchases Natural Gas 
Futures Contracts and certain Other Natural Gas Interests that are 
exchange-traded, the Fund will be required to deposit with the futures 
commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the
contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation
under the Natural Gas Interests at maturity.  This deposit is known as initial
margin.  Counterparties in transactions in Cleared Natural Gas Swaps and 
over-the-counter Natural Gas Interests will generally impose similar 
collateral requirements on the Fund.  The Sponsor will invest the Fund’s 
assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in Treasury 
Securities, cash and/or cash equivalents.  Subject to these margin and 
collateral requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine the 
percentage of assets that will be: 

· held as margin or collateral with futures commission merchants or other
  custodians;
 
· used for other investments; and
 
· held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.
  
In general, the Fund expects that it will be required to post between 5% and 
10% of the notional amount of a Natural Gas Interest as initial margin when 
entering into such Natural Gas Interest.  Ongoing margin and collateral 
payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and 
over-the-counter Natural Gas Interests based on changes in the value of the 
Natural Gas Interests.  Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with 
respect to over-the-counter Natural Gas Interests are negotiated by the 
parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the 
underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its 
exposure under the Natural Gas Interest, and each party’s creditworthiness.  
In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under 
exchange-traded and over-the-counter Natural Gas Interests and the fluctuating
nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to 
estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or 
collateral at any given time.  The Treasury Securities, cash and cash 
equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available 
to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.  All interest income will 
be used for the Fund’s benefit.
 
A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time.  Moreover, margin is merely a 
security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any 
positions held.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering to repay the 
loan balances outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of March 2,

(1) As of December 31, 2010, $111,169 of the offering expenses have been paid
    from the proceeds of the loans described below, including the SEC
    registration fee, the FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and
    audit expenses and $38,831 remains in our bank account. In addition, as
    of December 31, 2010, management has not incurred any reimbursable
    offering expenses that will be reimbursed by us following completion of
    this offering for items such as travel, translation cost, and
    administrative expenses. The offering expenses will be funded from the
    proceeds of this offering including the pre-paid portions. Accordingly,
    the $150,000 in loans from certain of our officers being used to pre-pay
    our offering expenses will be repaid without interest from the proceeds
    of this offering.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the sale of the
    placement warrants. For purposes of presentation, the current portion of
    underwriting discounts and commissions are reflected as the amount payable
    to the underwriters upon consummation of the offering. An additional
    $1,120,000, or $1,288,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in
    full, all of which will be deposited in the trust account following the
    consummation of the offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and
    when we consummate a business combination.

(3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.

(4)  The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant 
     at $385,800 even if the over-allotment is exercised. For purposes of 
     presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total 
     amount of net proceeds available to us.  

 (5)  The amount available to us for expenses and working capital will be the 
      same regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised. In 
      the event that our operating expenses exceed the working capital 
      available to us from net proceeds not held in trust account and interest 
      earned on monies held in the trust account (any amounts in the trust 
      account in excess of $10.00 per public share, or $9.97 per public share 
      in the event the over-allotment option is exercised in full), our 
      founders may fund any working capital requirements through loans to be 
      paid back upon the consummation of a business combination.  

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Chardan Capital 
Markets, LLC and our founders and their designees have committed to purchase 
the placement warrants from us for an aggregate purchase price of $1,683,800.
These purchases will take place on a private placement basis immediately 
prior to the consummation of this offering. We will not pay any discounts or 
commissions with respect to the purchase of the placement warrants. All of 
the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in the trust account
described below.

A total of approximately $40,000,000 (or approximately $45,868,000 if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds 
from this offering and the sale of the placement warrants described in this 
prospectus, including $1,120,000 (or $1,288,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions, will be placed in a trust account at Morgan Stanley with 
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company as trustee. We expect that the trust 
assets will be held in an account located outside of the United States. Net 
proceeds of this offering in the amount of $385,800 will not be held in the 
trust account. We believe the $385,800 of proceeds of this offering initially 
available to us outside of the trust account, together with the interest 
income on the balance of the trust account (any amounts in the trust account
in excess of $10.00 per public share, or $9.97 in the event the over-allotment
option is exercised in full) to be released to us from time to time for 
working capital requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for 
at least the next 24 months, assuming a business combination is not completed
during that time. The per unit amount in trust will be less than $10.00 in 
the event the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option because the 
underwriter’s discount is based on a percentage of the aggregate offering 
price, while other offering costs and the proceeds from the sale of the 
placement warrants are fixed regardless of whether the over-allotment option 
is exercised.

Except as described below and for any amounts paid to redeeming shareholders 
in connection with our initial business combination, the proceeds held in the
trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earlier 
of the consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. All amounts
held in the trust account that are not:

• distributed to shareholders who exercise redemption rights;

• released to us for working capital purposes and general corporate
  requirements (any amount in the trust account in excess of $10.00 per public
  share, or $9.97 per public share in the event the over-allotment option is
  exercised in full);

• released to us to pay taxes; or

• payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting discounts and 
  commissions,

will be released to us upon consummation of our initial business combination.

Our initial business combination will be with one or more target businesses 
that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust 
account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of 
$1,120,000, or $1,288,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, and taxes payable) at the time of such business 
combination, subject to:

• less than 84.3% of the public shareholders (or such lower percentage as
  a target business may require) electing to exercise their redemption rights;
  and

• such deferred underwriting discounts and commissions having been paid to the
  underwriters.

Our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses 
whose fair market value, individually or collectively, is equal to at least 
80% of the balance held in our trust account (excluding deferred underwriting 
discounts and commissions of $1,120,000, or $1,288,000 if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, and taxes payable) at the time of
such acquisition. The fair market value of the target will be determined by 
our board of directors based upon an analysis conducted by them (which may 
include an analysis of actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or 
book value). We anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% 
of the equity interests or assets of the target business. We may, however, 
structure a business combination to acquire less than 100% of such interests 
or assets of the target business, but will not acquire less than a controlling
interest and will in all instances be the controlling shareholder of the 
target company. The key factors that we will rely on in determining 
controlling shareholder status would be our acquisition of more than 50% of 
the voting rights of the target company and control of the majority of any 
governing body of the target company. We will not consider any transaction 
that does not meet such criteria.

We intend to acquire an operating business through a merger, capital stock 
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase or other similar business 
combination; however, there are a number of industries in certain countries 
(such as China) in which direct foreign investment is restricted (including
telecommunications services, and online commerce). Therefore, if a target
business is subject to these requirements, we may seek to acquire control of 
the target business through contractual arrangements with companies licensed 
to operate in the relevant jurisdiction and their owners. We may enter into 
a business combination in which we, our subsidiaries and/or affiliates, and 
the target business and its shareholders, enter into a series of contracts 
that are designed to confer to us economic benefits and risks of losses that 
are substantially similar to full ownership. These contracts could, for
example, result in a structure where, in exchange for our payment of the 
acquisition consideration, the target business would be majority or wholly 
owned by local residents whom we designate, and the target business would 
continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its business. 
We may also establish a new subsidiary in the relevant jurisdiction that would
provide technology, technical support, consulting and related services to the 
target business in exchange for fees, which are designed to transfer to us 
substantially all of the economic benefits of ownership of the target 
business.

Upon release of funds from the trust account, and after payment of the 
redemption price to any shareholders who exercise their redemption rights 
and the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to the underwriters,
the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or
a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which 
our initial business combination occurs. If the initial business combination
is paid for using equity or debt securities or additional funds from 
a private offering of debt or equity securities or borrowings, we may apply 
the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes,
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the acquired business
or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness 
incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the 
purchase of other companies, or for working capital.

Diana Liu and William Yu, each a director of ours, have loaned us a total of 
$150,000, which amount was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this 
offering referenced in the line items above related to the SEC registration 
fee, the FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and 
expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the consummation of 
this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering 
available to us.

We have agreed to pay to Kaiyuan Real Estate Development a total of $7,500 
per month for office space, administrative services and secretarial support 
for a period commencing on the date of this prospectus and ending on the 
earlier of our consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. 
Kaiyuan Real Estate Development is an affiliate of Mr. Yong Hui Li, our 
Chairman. This arrangement was agreed to by Kaiyuan Real Estate Development 
for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Li compensation in lieu 
of a management fee or other remuneration because it is anticipated that the 
expenses to be paid by Kaiyuan Real Estate Development will approximate the 
monthly reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable 
as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon consummation of 
a business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account and the interest income 
that may be released to us (all amounts in the trust fund account in excess 
of $10.00 per public share, or $9.97 per public share in the event the 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) and will be sufficient to pay the
costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated for up to 24 months. 
Our estimates are based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be 
undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business 
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth 
due diligence and negotiating a business combination is lower than the actual
amount necessary to do so, or in the event the amounts not held in the trust
account is insufficient to pay our costs and expenses, we may be required 
to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is 
currently unascertainable, through loans or additional investments from our 
founders or our officers and directors. None of our founders, officers or 
directors is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

The net proceeds from this offering and the private placement of the placement
warrants that are not immediately required for the purposes set forth above
will be invested only in U.S. “government securities” (as such term is 
defined in the Investment Company Act), so that we are not deemed to be an 
investment company under the Investment Company Act.

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial 
services described above, and any share options issued to our officers, 
directors, employees, and/or consultants, we will not pay fees of 
any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) to any of our officers, and
directors, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to 
or in connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, 
our officers, and directors and their respective affiliates will receive 
reimbursement for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in 
connection with identifying, investigating and consummating a potential 
business combination with one of more target businesses. There are no 
limitations on the amount of expenses for which they can seek reimbursement, 
provided such expenses were incurred for our benefit. We expect that due 
diligence of prospective target businesses will be monitored or performed by 
Diana Chia-Huei Liu, William Tsu-Cheng Yu, Yong Hui Li, Hui Kai Yan, and Gary 
Han Ming Chang. Additionally, we may engage market research firms and/or
third-party consultants. Our board of directors will have the responsibility 
of reviewing and approving all expense reimbursements made to our founders, 
officers or directors, and their respective affiliates, with any interested 
director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. To the extent 
that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust 
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we 
consummate a business combination. These expenses would be a liability of the
post-combination business and would be treated in a manner similar to any 
other account payable of the combined business. Our officers and directors 
may, as part of any such business combination, negotiate the repayment of 
some or all of any such expenses. If the target business’ owners do not 
agree to such repayment, this could cause our directors to view such 
potential business combination unfavorably and result in a conflict of 
interest. Although we currently expect that the members of our management 
team will become a part of the management team of the combined entity, since 
the actual role of each present member of management after a business 
combination is uncertain, we have no current ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only in the event of (i) our liquidation if we fail to consummate our initial 
business combination within the allotted time, or (ii) if the public 
shareholder seeks to have us redeem such shares for cash in connection with 
a business combination that that was actually consummated. In no other 
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any 
kind in or to the funds in the trust account.

Upon consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters 
will receive the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions held in the 
trust account, regardless of the number of ordinary shares that are redeemed.
In this offering, the underwriters did not agree to prorate the deferred 
underwriting discount because a majority of the total underwriting discount 
is deferred and the overall discount is relatively low for a public offering 
by a blank check company. If we do not complete an initial business 
combination and the trustee therefore distributes the balance in the trust 
account upon our liquidation, the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit
any rights or claims to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, 
together with any accrued interest thereon, in the trust account and (ii) 
that the trustee is authorized to distribute the deferred underwriting 
discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interest thereon, net 
of taxes payable, and net of interest income earned on the trust account 
previously released to us to fund our working capital and general corporate 
requirements, to the public shareholders on a pro rata basis."

 (1)  A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee,
      the FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been
      paid from the funds we received from BBS Capital Fund, LP and Hauser 
      Holdings, LLC described below. These funds will be repaid out of the 
      proceeds of this offering available to us.  

 (2)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of 
      the insider warrants.  

 (3)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $250,000
      even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income 
      earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us 
      to pay for our tax obligations and our working capital requirements. We 
      anticipate having approximately $91,392 of interest (after payment of 
      taxes owed on such interest income) available to us.  

The estimated interest earned on funds held in the trust account is based on 
what believe to be a conservative interest rate of 0.14% per annum following 
this offering generated from the funds which will be invested principally in 
treasuries having a maturity of 180 days or less. During the six month period 
ended March 10, 2011, U.S. treasuries with six month maturities were yielding 
approximately 0.14% per annum. The 0.14% assumed interest rate has been applied
for the purpose of the above calculation because we believe it represents a 
conservative estimate calculated based on the above described yields. While we 
cannot assure you the balance of the trust account will be invested to yield 
these rates, we believe such rates are representative of those we may receive 
on the balance of the trust account. For purposes of presentation, the full 
amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds we expect 
to be available to us immediately following the offering.  

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our initial 
shareholders have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate 
purchase price of $2,310,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a 
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. 
We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of 
the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be
placed in the trust account described below. 

$32,640,000, or $37,272,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, 
of net proceeds of this offering, including the $2,310,000 we will receive from
the sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Citibank
(Hong Kong) Limited maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 
as trustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States 
treasuries having a maturity of 180 days or less, so that we are not deemed to 
be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect 
to (i) any amounts released to us to purchase our ordinary shares as described 
below, (ii) interest income earned on the funds in trust released to us to pay 
our income or other tax obligations and (iii) interest income earned on the 
funds in trust released to us for our working capital requirements, the funds 
held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of 
(i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the liquidation of the 
trust account if we have not completed a business combination within the 
required time period. If the public shares trade at a price at or below $7.75 
per share, there will be released to us from the trust account amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 50% of the shares sold in this offering (2,000,000
shares, or 2,300,000 shares if the over-allotment option is exercised in full)
at any time commencing 61 days after the closing of this offering and ending 
on the date on which we announce an initial business combination. Purchases 
will be made only in open market transactions pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan that we
will enter into immediately prior to the date of this prospectus. A 10b5-1 plan
is an investment plan that permits a publicly traded company and/or its 
officers, directors and other insiders to arrange for future transactions in 
their company’s securities that can be completed even though nonpublic 
information later becomes available. The 10b5-1 plan will require us to 
maintain a limit order for the public shares to be purchased by us at $7.75 per
share during the purchase period until the maximum number of shares have been 
purchased. It is intended that purchases will comply with the technical 
requirements of Rule 10b-18 (including timing, pricing and volume of purchases)
under the Exchange Act (although the purchases may not actually be effected 
under Rule 10b-18). The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as 
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of 
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

In addition, we have agreed to pay EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. a cash fee equal to 
$1,120,000 upon consummation of a business combination for acting as our 
investment banker on a non-exclusive basis to assist us in structuring and 
negotiating a business combination (but not for purposes of identifying a 
target business). 

We have agreed to pay to BBS Capital Fund, LP and Rampant Dragon, LLC a total 
of $7,500 per month for office space, administrative services and secretarial 
support for a period commencing on the date of this prospectus and ending on 
the earlier of our consummation of a business combination or the liquidation of
the trust account. BBS Capital Fund, LLC is an affiliate of Berke Bakay, our 
Executive Chairman. Rampant Dragon, LLC is one of our shareholders. This 
arrangement was agreed to by BBS Capital Fund, LP and Rampant Dragon, LLC for 
our benefit and is not intended to provide BBS Capital Fund, LP or Rampant 
Dragon, LLC compensation in lieu of a management fee or other remuneration 
because it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid by BBS Capital Fund, LP 
and Rampant Dragon, LLC will approximate the monthly reimbursement. We believe 
that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an 
unaffiliated person. Upon consummation of a business combination or the 
liquidation of the trust account if we have not completed a business 
combination within the required time period, we will cease paying these monthly
fees. 

Other than this $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including 
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, initial shareholders, or any of their affiliates, prior 
to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of
the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as 
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on 
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to 
and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target 
businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be
paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to 
“Legal, accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the search for 
target businesses and to the due diligence investigation, structuring and 
negotiation of a business combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target 
businesses by our officers, directors and initial shareholders” and “Working 
capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate 
purposes, liquidation obligations and reserves.” Since the role of present 
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to 
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a 
business combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net 
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working 
capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be 
approximately $250,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be 
released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for a 
business combination. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses for director and officer liability insurance premiums, 
with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, 
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business 
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders in connection with 
activities on our behalf as described below. We will also be entitled to have 
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay 
any tax obligations that we may owe. We believe these funds will be sufficient 
to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion
of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us 
with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a 
“no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target 
businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on 
terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular 
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to 
receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a 
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the 
terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available 
funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our 
breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to 
continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential 
target businesses. 

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust 
account, along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these 
funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may 
reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories. 

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, 
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the cash fee equal to 
$1,120,000 payable to EarlyBirdCapital upon consummation of the business 
combination for acting as our investment banker on a non-exclusive basis to 
assist us in structuring and negotiating a business combination (but not for 
purposes of identifying a target business). To the extent that our capital 
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business 
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to 
consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and
will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working 
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital 
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the 
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, 
research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be 
used to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred 
prior to the completion of our business combination if the funds available to 
us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay 
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our initial shareholders 
have agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation 
(currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have 
agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. 

BBS Capital Fund, LP, an entity with which Berke Bakay, our executive Chairman,
is affiliated, and Hauser Holdings LLC, an entity with which Richard Hauser, 
our Special Advisor, is affiliated, have advanced to us an aggregate of 
$150,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering 
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee 
and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be 
payable without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loan will be
repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of 
offering expenses. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the 
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business 
combination is not consummated during that time. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) 
only in the event of the liquidation of the trust account, if that public 
shareholder redeems such shares for cash in connection with a business 
combination which we consummate or if that public shareholder sells his shares 
to us as described elsewhere in this prospectus. In no other circumstances will
a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust 
account."

stock offered by us will be approximately $86,438,500, based on the initial 
public offering price of $13.00 per share and after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We 
will not receive any proceeds from the shares of common stock offered by the 
selling stockholders, including if the underwriters’ exercise their option to 
purchase additional shares, although we may pay the expenses, other than 
underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with the sale of those 
shares.

We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for repayment
of outstanding indebtedness. Our senior subordinated promissory note agreement 
with Ironwood Equity Fund LLP includes a redemption right at Ironwood’s option 
if the consummation of this offering takes place between March 31, 2010 and 
March 30, 2011. Ironwood has notified us that it will exercise this right. 
Accordingly, we will use a portion of the net proceeds to redeem the 
outstanding principal amount of the Ironwood note, which was $4.0 million at 
December 31, 2010, at 103% of the principal balance, or $4.1 million, together 
with accrued interest. The note currently bears interest at 11.3% per annum, 
which is payable monthly, and has a maturity date of March 31, 2014. We also 
intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay in full
the outstanding principal and accrued interest on our line of credit with 
Silicon Valley Bank, which was approximately $5.1 million and bore interest at 
a rate of 6.5% per annum as of December 31, 2010. All borrowings under the 
credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank are otherwise due in August 2012. We 
used our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank to repay our prior line of 
credit with Comerica Bank and to fund general operating expenses. 

Net proceeds received by us from this offering may also be used for general 
corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, research and 
development, general and administrative matters, capital expenditures, and 
working capital. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the 
acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that 
complement our business, although we have no present understandings, 
commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions or investments. 

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including the cash used in or generated by our operations, the status 
of our development, the level of our sales and marketing, accounting services 
and consulting services activities, and our technology investments and 
acquisitions. Our management has discretion over many of these factors. 
Therefore, we are unable estimate the amount of net proceeds from this offering
that will be used for any of the purposes described above. Our management will 
have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this offering. 
Pending the above uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering
in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities, such as money 
market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed 
obligations of the U.S. government. We cannot predict whether the invested 
proceeds will yield a favorable return."

common stock by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to partially fund 
approximately $12 million in discretionary incentive payments to all of our 
employees, excluding our executive officers. The remainder of the funds 
necessary to make our employee incentive payments, if necessary, will be made
from cash on hand.

Pending such use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

We intend to use the anticipated net proceeds from this offering to repay 
certain of our existing indebtedness, as will be determined following 
completion of this offering, and for general corporate purposes. Pending such

amounts under our asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured
revolving credit facility. Our asset-based revolving credit facility currently 
matures on November 16, 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.25%. Our senior
secured revolving credit facility matures on November 17, 2012 and will be 
extended to November 17, 2015 and currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our senior secured

(1)  Does not include $29.5 million in assets to be received from Franklin 
Financial Corporation MHC.  

(2)  Following the completion of the stock offering and in accordance with 
applicable regulations, Franklin Financial Corporation may purchase shares of 
its common stock in the open market in order to grant awards of restricted 
stock under its proposed equity incentive plan. Assuming a market price of 
$10.00 per share at the time of purchase, the cost of acquiring the shares 
would be approximately $3.7 million (367,710 shares) at the minimum of the 
offering range, $4.3 million (432,600 shares) at the midpoint of the offering 
range, $5.0 million (497,490 shares) at the maximum of the offering range and 
$5.7 million (572,114 shares) at the maximum, as adjusted, of the offering 
range and assuming we grant a number of restricted stock awards equal to 4% of 
the sum of the shares sold in the offering and contributed to the foundation. 

Franklin Financial Corporation intends to use $10.0 million in offering 
proceeds to repay an inter-company loan made from Franklin Federal to Franklin 
Financial Corporation MHC. Franklin Financial Corporation also intends to 
invest the proceeds it retains from the offering initially in short-term, 
liquid investments as well as equity securities of financial institutions and 
other corporate issuers consistent with its investment policy. Over time, 
Franklin Financial Corporation may use the proceeds it retains from the 
offering: 

     •     to pay dividends to stockholders; 
 
     •     to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory 
           restrictions; 
 
     •     to finance the possible acquisition of other financial institutions 
           or other businesses that are related to banking, although we 
           currently have no plans, arrangements or understandings regarding 
           potential acquisition opportunities; and 

     •     for general corporate purposes. 
 
The specific amounts of net proceeds to be allocated in the future to each of 
the uses described above have not been determined, are subject to change and 
will depend on capital requirements, the market for investment securities, 
regulatory limitations, future expansion opportunities and our operating 
results and financial condition. 

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, Franklin Financial 
Corporation may not repurchase shares of its common stock during the first 
year following the offering, except to fund stockholder-approved equity 
benefit plans or, with prior regulatory approval, when extraordinary 
circumstances exist. 

Franklin Federal may use the proceeds that it receives from the offering, 
which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to Franklin 
Federal: 

     •     to fund new loans; 
 
     •     to invest in securities; 
 
     •     to introduce new deposit products and technologies, including debit 
           cards and checking accounts with electronic bill payment, internet

(1)  Does not include $29.5 million in assets to be received from Franklin 
Financial Corporation MHC.  

(2)  Following the completion of the stock offering and in accordance with 
applicable regulations, Franklin Financial Corporation may purchase shares of 
its common stock in the open market in order to grant awards of restricted 
stock under its proposed equity incentive plan. Assuming a market price of 
$10.00 per share at the time of purchase, the cost of acquiring the shares 
would be approximately $3.7 million (367,710 shares) at the minimum of the 
offering range, $4.3 million (432,600 shares) at the midpoint of the offering 
range, $5.0 million (497,490 shares) at the maximum of the offering range and 
$5.7 million (572,114 shares) at the maximum, as adjusted, of the offering 
range and assuming we grant a number of restricted stock awards equal to 4% of 
the sum of the shares sold in the offering and contributed to the foundation. 

Franklin Financial Corporation intends to use $10.0 million in offering 
proceeds to repay an inter-company loan made from Franklin Federal to Franklin 
Financial Corporation MHC. Franklin Financial Corporation also intends to 
invest the proceeds it retains from the offering initially in short-term, 
liquid investments as well as equity securities of financial institutions and 
other corporate issuers consistent with its investment policy. Over time, 
Franklin Financial Corporation may use the proceeds it retains from the 
offering: 

     •     to pay dividends to stockholders; 
 
     •     to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory 
           restrictions; 
 
     •     to finance the possible acquisition of other financial institutions 
           or other businesses that are related to banking, although we 
           currently have no plans, arrangements or understandings regarding 
           potential acquisition opportunities; and 

     •     for general corporate purposes. 
 
The specific amounts of net proceeds to be allocated in the future to each of 
the uses described above have not been determined, are subject to change and 
will depend on capital requirements, the market for investment securities, 
regulatory limitations, future expansion opportunities and our operating 
results and financial condition. 

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, Franklin Financial 
Corporation may not repurchase shares of its common stock during the first 
year following the offering, except to fund stockholder-approved equity 
benefit plans or, with prior regulatory approval, when extraordinary 
circumstances exist. 

Franklin Federal may use the proceeds that it receives from the offering, 
which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to Franklin 
Federal: 

     •     to fund new loans; 
 
     •     to invest in securities; 
 
     •     to introduce new deposit products and technologies, including debit 
           cards and checking accounts with electronic bill payment, internet 
           banking and other capabilities; 
 
     •     subject to the receipt of regulatory approval, to finance the 
           possible expansion of its business activities through the 
           establishment of new branch offices and/or the acquisition of other 
           financial institutions or financial services companies, although we 
           currently have no plans, arrangements or understandings regarding 
           potential expansion or acquisition opportunities; and 
 
    •     for general corporate purposes. 
 
Except as described above, neither Franklin Financial Corporation nor Franklin 
Federal has any specific plans, arrangements or understandings for the 
investment of the proceeds of this offering and has not allocated a specific 
portion of the proceeds to any particular use. For a discussion of our 
business reasons for undertaking the offering."

shares to cover over-allotments in full, at the initial public offering price 
of $12.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
common stock, obtain additional capital, facilitate our future access to the 
public equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential 
customers and improve our competitive position. We intend to use the net 
proceeds to us from this offering for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes such as expanding our international operations, product 
development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative matters. 
Additionally, we may choose to expand our current business through 
acquisitions of or investments in other businesses, products or technologies, 
using cash or shares of our common stock. However, we have no commitments with
respect to any such acquisitions or investments at this time. 

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government."

approximately US$177.2 million, or approximately US$204.4 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. These estimates are based upon the initial public offering price of 
US$15.00 per ADS. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by 
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We 
currently plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

• approximately US$70.0 million to expand our data center infrastructure; 
 
• approximately US$30.0 million to expand our network infrastructure; and 
 
• the remaining amount to fund working capital and for other general corporate
  purposes, including strategic investment in, and acquisitions of,
  complementary businesses (although we are not negotiating any such
  investment or acquisition). 
 
The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. 
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus. 

In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we 
are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC 
subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to our PRC
affiliated entities only through loans, subject to satisfaction of applicable 
government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure you that 
we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on 
a timely basis, if at all.   

To the extent that a certain portion or all of the net proceeds we receive 
from this offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we 
plan to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt 
instruments or bank deposits. These investments may have a material adverse 
effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in our 
ADSs."

sale of 13,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting 
underwriting discounts, structuring and advisory fees and estimated offering 
expenses. We intend to use these proceeds as follows: 
  
   
   •   $241.6 million will be distributed to Tesoro, in part to reimburse 
Tesoro for certain capital expenditures it incurred with respect to assets 
contributed to us;  
   
   •   $2.0 million for debt issuance costs; and  
   
   •   $3.0 million for working capital purposes.  

  
At the closing of this offering, we will enter into a new $150.0 million 
credit facility, under which we will borrow $50.0 million to fund an 
additional $50.0 million cash distribution to Tesoro. The cash distributions 
to Tesoro from the proceeds of this offering and the borrowing under our 
revolving credit facility will be made in consideration of its contribution of 
assets to us and to reimburse Tesoro for certain capital expenditures incurred 
with respect to these assets. We are funding these distributions through a 
combination of net proceeds from this offering and borrowings under our 
revolving credit facility in order to optimize our capital structure. 
  
The table below sets forth our anticipated use of the expected net proceeds 
from this offering after deducting underwriting discounts, structuring and 
advisory fees and estimated offering expenses:

The net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to 
purchase additional common units will be used to redeem from Tesoro a number 
of common units equal to the number of common units issued upon exercise of 
the option at a price per common unit equal to the net proceeds per common 
unit in this offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting 
discounts and the structuring fee. Tesoro is deemed to be an underwriter with 
respect to any common units so redeemed. These net proceeds will be paid to 
Tesoro in partial consideration of its contribution of assets to us. 
Accordingly, any exercise of the underwriter’s option will not affect the 
total number of units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the 
minimum quarterly distribution on all units."

receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately US$22.3 million, or 
approximately US$25.8 million if the underwriters exercise their

commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. A US$1.00 increase 
(decrease) in the initial public offering price of US$9.00 per ordinary share 
would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by 
approximately US$2.6 million, assuming the number of shares offered, as set 
forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after 
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering to expand 
our feedstock operations, including but not limited to Jatropha acreage 
expansion and construction of crude Jatropha oil extraction facilities, as 
well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes including 
but not limited to capital expenditure at our current production facilities 
and payment of company overheads (including the costs of this offer). We may 
also seek to expand by acquiring or investing in strategic businesses or 
assets that complement our service and product offerings. At this time, we 
have not entered into any agreement or commitment with respect to any 
material acquisitions or investments. 

We have not yet determined all of our expected expenditures and we cannot with
any precision estimate the amounts to be used for the purposes set forth 
above. Assuming we receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately 
US$22.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us and assuming no exercise of the over-allotment
option based on the public offering price of US$9.00 per ordinary share, we 
currently propose to use the net proceeds as follows: 

Use of Funds 
 º US$10.0 million — Development Capital:  
 º expansion of feedstock business, including Jatropha plantation acreage
   (US$8.0 million); and  
 º construction of crude oil extraction facilities and other capital
   expenditure at our current production facilities (US$2.0 million).  
 º US$12.3 million — Working Capital and Other General Corporate Purposes:  
 º working capital (US$8.8 million); and  
 º other general corporate purposes (US$3.5 million).  

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will depend on the amount of cash 
generated by our operations, competitive and market developments and the 
availability of acquisition or investment opportunities on terms acceptable 
to us. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in 
applying the net proceeds of this offering. 

Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing bank deposits, 
money market funds or U.S. Government securities. These investments may have 
a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your 
investment in our ordinary shares."

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate 
that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $95.5 million, 
based upon an initial public offering price of $16.00 per share and after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
fund our operations and growth, to create a public market for our common stock 
and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. 

We expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes, which we expect to include funding working capital, operating 
expenses, the continued development of our product pipeline and portfolio, the 
maintenance and expansion of our current collaboration arrangements, the 
strengthening of our existing commercial organization and the selective 
pursuit of business development opportunities in our focus segment areas. At 
this time, we have not specifically identified a large single use or product 
for which we intend to use the net proceeds, and, accordingly, we are not able 
to allocate the net proceeds among any of these potential uses in light of the 
variety of factors that will impact how such net proceeds are ultimately 
utilized by us. Such factors include how quickly we are able to begin to 
generate operating profits, whether our revenues continue to increase and, if 
so, the rate of any such increase and the overall level of our product 
development activity. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion 
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. 

Although we have not allocated any of the net proceeds from this offering for 
a specific purpose, we may use a portion of such net proceeds to fund our 
product development activity. As of December 31, 2010, we had a total of 51 
new products in various stages of initial development for which we had 
incurred an aggregate of $9.3 million of development costs. Since our 
inception, we have incurred an average of approximately $0.6 million of 
development costs on a per product basis with respect to our marketed products 
and new products represented by ANDAs under review by the FDA as of December 
31, 2010, with our largest development costs for a single product being 
approximately $3.0 million. We estimate that we will incur approximately $21.7 
million of additional development costs with respect to these 51 products. The 
actual cost to complete the development of such new products may differ from 
that estimated amount and such difference may be material due to a variety of 
factors, including the complexity of the molecule, the availability and cost 
of API and the potential need for bioequivalence or additional studies. 

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-
term, investment-grade and interest-bearing instruments."

acquisition of commercial aircraft and for general corporate purposes. 
  
Pending the use of any proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this 
offering in short-term interest bearing bank deposits or short-term interest 
bearing securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the 
United States or a person controlled by the government of the United States. 
  
We will have broad discretion over the timing and manner in which we apply the 
net proceeds that we receive from this offering. The amount and timing of what 
we actually spend for the intended uses of proceeds described above may vary 
significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including the number and 
purchase price of aircraft that we acquire; the types, amounts and terms of 
debt and equity financing and credit support we are able to obtain; the 
number, pricing and duration of leases we execute with customers; our future 
revenues and cash generated by our operations; our operating costs."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful consummation of our initial
    business combination. 

(2)  A portion of the offering expenses reflected above under “Offering
     Expenses”, such as the SEC Expenses, FINRA Expenses and the legal fees
     and expenses have been pre-funded with the proceeds of an aggregate of
     $150,000 in loans from our sponsor, Global Cornerstone Holdings LLC.
     These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
     earlier of December 31, 2011 or the closing of this offering. These loans
     will be repaid upon consummation of this offering out of the $750,000 of
     offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering
     expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering
     expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
     used for post-closing working capital expenses.  

(3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $2.8 million of their
     underwriting commissions (or approximately $3.22 million if the
     underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which equals
     3.5% of the gross proceeds from the units offered to the public, until
     consummation of initial business combination. Upon consummation of our
     initial business combination, approximately $2.8 million, which
     constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or approximately $3.22
     million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
     will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account,
     and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all
     or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with
     which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate
     purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness
     incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the
     purchases of other companies or for working capital.  

(4) Includes a management fee in an aggregate amount of approximately $35,000
    payable to our sponsor, which will in turn be paid to our Chief Financial
    Officer and Executive Vice-President, Byron I. Sproule (a member of our 
    sponsor), for services performed prior to the closing of this offering.  

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available
    for our expenses. The amount of interest available to us from the trust
    account may be less than $0.8 million as a result of the current interest
    rate environment. We anticipate that approximately $250,000 (after payment
    of taxes on such interest income) will be available to us from interest
    income to be earned on the funds held in the trust account. The estimated
    interest earned on funds held in the trust account is based on what we
    believe to be a conservative interest rate of 0.18% per annum following
    this offering generated from the funds which may be invested in United
    States “government securities,” defined as any U.S. Treasury Bills having
    a maturity of 180 days or less and in United States tax exempt money
    market funds, which invest solely in government securities. During the six
    month period ended February 28, 2011, U.S. Treasury Bills with six month
    maturities were yielding approximately 0.18% per annum. The 0.18% assumed
    interest rate has been applied for the purpose of the above calculation
    because we believe it represents a conservative estimate calculated based
    on the above-described yields. While we cannot assure you the balance of
    the trust will be invested to yield these rates, we believe such rates are
    representative of those we may receive on the balance of the trust account.
    For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as
    the total amount of net proceeds available to use immediately following
    the offering.  

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.  

(7) Reflects 21 months of such payments.  

(8) Reflects payment of a management fee in the amount of approximately $17,000
    per month to our sponsor, which will in turn be paid to our Chief Financial
    Officer and Executive Vice-President, Byron I. Sproule (a member of our
    sponsor) for services to be performed until the earlier of (i) the closing
    of our initial business combination or (ii) 21 months from the date of
    this prospectus.  

A total of approximately $80.0 million (or approximately $91.7 million if the 
underwriters’ over- allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds
from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in this 
prospectus, including approximately $2.8 million (or approximately $3.22 
million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of 
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S. trust account 
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be 
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days 
or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 
under the Investment Company Act, which invest solely in such U.S. government 
treasury bills. Except for a portion of the interest income that may be 
released to us to pay any taxes and to fund our working capital requirements, 
as discussed below, and any amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of our 
public shares if we seek shareholder approval of our business combination as 
will be permitted under our memorandum and articles of association, none of 
the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account until the 
earlier of: (i) the consummation of a business combination within 21 months 
from the closing of this offering, (ii) a redemption to public shareholders 
prior to any voluntary winding-up in the event we do not consummate a business
combination within such 21 month period, or (iii) pursuant to any liquidation. 

We may increase the initial amount held in the trust account from 
approximately $10.00 per unit prior to the effectiveness of the registration 
statement of which this prospectus forms a part. In such case, the increase 
would be funded by an increase in the amount of the deferral of the 
underwriting commissions payable in connection with this offering, an increase
in the number of sponsor warrants to be purchased by our sponsor at a price 
of $1.00 per warrant and/or a reduction from $650,000 of the amount initially
available to us for working capital that is not held in the trust account. 
Public shareholders would own a smaller percentage of our outstanding ordinary
shares on a fully diluted basis to the extent that our sponsor purchases 
additional warrants. We do not intend to reduce the initial amount to be held 
in the trust account. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business 
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or 
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are 
used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business 
combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that is 
not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including 
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the 
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for 
working capital. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income of 
up to $0.8 million, subject to proportionate adjustment in the event the size 
of the offering changes as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of any 
portion of the over-allotment option or we otherwise decided to make such 
a change prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which 
this prospectus forms a part, earned on the trust account balance (net of 
taxes payable) that may be released to fund our working capital requirements 
will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are 
allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary
due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of 
interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the 
circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have 
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that 
addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business 
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount 
of interest available to use from the trust account is less than $0.8 million 
as a result of the current interest rate environment, we may be required to 
raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is 
currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional 
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation 
to advance funds to, or invest in, us. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option or the size of this offering is increased, the maximum 
amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust account will 
proportionately increase (for example, if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option is exercised in full, the size of the offering will increase by 15%, 
and the maximum amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust 
account will increase to approximately $0.92 million). In addition, if the 
size of this offering is decreased, the maximum amount of interest income we 
may withdraw from the trust account will proportionately decrease. We will 
use any proportionate increase in interest income to cover our working 
capital expenses. While we currently do not know what our future working 
capital expenses will be and while they will not necessarily be proportionate 
to the size of the offering, we believe that any additional interest income 
released to us would facilitate our ability to finance the exploration and 
consideration of a greater number of potential acquisition targets. 

Commencing on the date that our securities are first quoted on the OTCBB, we 
have agreed to pay Global Cornerstone Holdings LLC, our sponsor, an entity 
controlled by our officers and directors, a total of $3,000 per month for 
office space, administrative services and secretarial support. This 
arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our benefit and is not 
intended to provide our sponsor compensation in lieu of salary or other 
remuneration. In addition, we will pay a management fee to our sponsor, which 
will in turn be paid to our Chief Financial Officer and Executive 
Vice-President, Byron I. Sproule (a member of our sponsor), payable: (i) upon 
consummation of this offering, in an aggregate amount of approximately $35,000
for services performed prior to the consummation of this offering and (ii) 
following the consummation of this offering, in the amount of approximately 
$17,000 per month for services to be performed until the earlier of (x) the 
closing of our initial business combination or (y) 21 months from the date 
of this prospectus. 

We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained
from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our initial business 
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. 

As of the date of this prospectus, Global Cornerstone Holdings LLC, our 
sponsor, has advanced to us a total of $150,000 to be used for a portion 
of the expenses of this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing, 
unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2011 or the closing of 
this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out 
of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment 
of offering expenses. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts not otherwise converted into 
warrants (as described below) with proceeds released to us from the trust 
account to the extent such repayment would not reduce the per-share redemption
amount receivable by shareholders to below $10.00 per share (or approximately
$9.97 per share if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
full). In the event that the initial business combination does not close, or 
if repayment of such loaned amounts would reduce the per-share redemption 
amount receivable by shareholders to below $10.00 per share (or approximately 
$9.97 per share if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
full), we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust 
account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account 
would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $425,000 of such loans may 
be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at 
a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would 
be identical to the sponsor warrants. The terms of such loans by our officers 
and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements
exist with respect to such loans. 

Unlike many blank check companies, if we seek shareholder approval of our 
initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection 
with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, prior to 
the consummation of a business combination, our memorandum and articles of 
association will permit the release to us from the trust account of amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares sold in this offering (1,200,000
shares, or 1,380,000 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) at any time commencing after the filing of a preliminary 
proxy statement for our initial business combination and ending on the date 
of the shareholder meeting to approve the initial business combination. 
Purchases will be made only in open market transactions at times when we are 
not in possession of any material non-public information and may not be made 
during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. It is 
intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, 
which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, 
including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases. If the 
conditions of Rule 10b-18, as in effect at the time we wish to make such 
purchases, are not satisfied, it is likely that we will not make such 
purchases. Any purchases we make will be at prices (inclusive of commissions) 
not to exceed the per-share amount then held in the trust account 
(approximately $10.00 per share or approximately $9.97 per share if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). We can purchase 
any or all of the 1,200,000 shares (or 1,380,000 shares if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) we are entitled to purchase. It
will be entirely in our discretion as to how many shares are purchased. 
Purchasing decisions will be made based on various factors, including the 
then current market price of our ordinary shares and the terms of the proposed
business combination. All shares purchased by us will be immediately 
cancelled. Such open market purchases, if any, would be conducted by us to 
minimize any disparity between the then current market price of our ordinary 
shares and the per-share amount held in the trust account. A market price 
below the per-share trust amount could provide an incentive for purchasers 
to buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary proxy statement at 
a discount to the per-share amount held in the trust account for the sole 
purpose of voting against our initial business combination and exercising 
redemption rights for the full per share amount held in the trust account. 
Such trading activity could enable such investors to block a business
combination by making it difficult for us to obtain the approval of such 
business combination by the vote of a majority of our outstanding ordinary 
shares. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant 
to the tender offer rules, we may enter into privately negotiated transactions
to purchase public shares from shareholders following consummation of the 
initial business combination with proceeds released to us from the trust 
account immediately following consummation of the initial business combination.
Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may also 
purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or 
following the consummation of our initial business combination. Neither we nor
our directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will make any such 
purchases when we or they are in possession of any material non-public 
information not disclosed to the seller. Although we do not currently 
anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, in the 
event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of 
those shareholders not receiving any such additional consideration. In 
addition, the payment of a premium by us after the consummation of our initial
business combination may not be in the best interest of the remaining 
shareholders who do not redeem their shares. Such shareholders will experience
a reduction in book value per share compared to the value received by 
shareholders that have their shares purchased by us at a premium. Except for 
the limitations described above on use of trust proceeds released to us prior 
to consummating our initial business combination, there is no limit on the 
amount of shares that could be acquired by us or our affiliates, or the price 
we or they may pay, if we hold a shareholder vote. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our 
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption 
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption 
of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for 
an alternate business combination. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such 
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described 
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) 
agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of a proposed business 
combination or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to 
consummate an initial business combination within 21 months following the 
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described 
herein. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right 
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. 

Our sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its 
founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of 
a business combination. In addition, our sponsor has agreed to waive its 
redemption rights with respect to its founder shares if we fail to consummate
a business combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering. 
However, if our sponsor, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates 
acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to 
redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate 
a business combination within the required time period."

us will be approximately $21.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the shares of common stock to be offered by the 
selling stockholders, although we will pay the expenses, other than 
underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with the sale of those 
shares. The selling stockholders include our chief executive officer, our 
chief technology officer and entities affiliated with members of our board of 
directors. 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for 
general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing 
activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures. We 
may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or 
investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our 
business. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to 
enter into any acquisitions or investments. Our management will have broad 
discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending these 
uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, 
investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, 
certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the

offering will be approximately $58.4 million, after deducting underwriters’ 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that the 
net proceeds to us will be approximately $67.7 million. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for the 
ADSs, obtain additional equity capital and facilitate future access to the 
public markets. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for
general corporate purposes. If the opportunity arises, we may use a portion of 
the net proceeds from this offering to acquire or invest in businesses, 
products or technologies that are complementary to our own. We are not 
currently a party to any agreements or commitments for any acquisitions, and
we have no current understandings with respect to any acquisitions. 

Management’s plans for the use of the proceeds of this offering are subject to 
change due to unforeseen events and opportunities, and the amounts and timing 
of our actual expenditures depend on several factors, including our expansion 
plans and the amount of cash generated or used by our operations. We cannot 
specify with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received 
upon completion of this offering. Accordingly, our management team will have 
broad discretion in using the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the use 
of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, 
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments. We will not use any of the 
proceeds of this offering to repay any of our indebtedness to Natixis, Natixis 
Factor or any of their affiliates, including the €2.5 million ($3.3 million) 
currently outstanding under our convertible notes subscription facility or the 
$3.9 million currently owed under our factoring agreement."

our common stock in this offering will be approximately $160.6 million (or 
approximately $185.6 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment 
option in full), in each case after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions of approximately $12.5 million (or approximately $14.4 million if 
the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full) and estimated 
organizational and net offering expenses of approximately $5.6 million payable 
by us. We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to our operating 
partnership in exchange for common units in our operating partnership. 

We expect our operating partnership will use the net proceeds, together with 
borrowings in the amount of approximately $11.0 million under our secured 
corporate revolving credit facility, as follows: 

• approximately $159.3 million (including principal and related accrued 
interest) to repay mortgage debt secured by certain of the properties we will 
acquire in our formation transactions, including approximately $5.4 million 
secured by the Option Properties (common units to be issued to Fund III in our 
formation transactions will be reduced accordingly), which bears interest at a 
weighted average rate of 4.3% per annum and has a weighted average remaining 
years to maturity of 1.54 years; 


• approximately $4.4 million (including principal and related accrued 
interest) to repay the loan dated January 31, 2009 from an affiliate of NED to 
the Fund III subsidiaries that will be contributed to us in our formation 
transactions, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 12.50% per annum and is 
scheduled to mature on January 31, 2012; 


• approximately $3.0 million (including principal and related accrued 
interest) to repay the loan originally drawn on May 15, 2007 from Fund III to 
the management company, of which $312,600 was advanced to the management 
company in the past 12 months for payment of general corporate expenses 
(including salaries, office rent, interest on corporate debt, etc.), which 
bears interest at 9.0% per annum and has no stated maturity date; 


• approximately $1.3 million for general corporate purposes including 
acquisitions of real estate assets; 


• approximately $1.3 million to repay expenditures associated with the 
retirement of indebtedness and the attainment of lender consents on existing 
indebtedness (including financing fees, related legal fees, and contingent 
waiver fees), and fees associated with the revolving credit facility; 


• approximately $1.0 million (including principal and related accrued 
interest) to repay the line of credit dated May 15, 2007 from an affiliate of 
NED to the management company, which bears interest at 13.0% per annum and is 
scheduled to mature on December 31, 2011; 


• approximately $0.6 million to pay transfer taxes and fees associated with 
the contribution of our properties to us; 


• approximately $0.5 million to terminate a portion of an interest rate swap 
due to the retirement of mortgage debt; and 


• approximately $0.2 million to post as escrows for our mortgage debt.
 
If the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, we expect to 
use the additional $25.0 million of net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes, including acquisitions of real estate assets. 

The debt repayments described above are estimated based on principal and 
related accrued interest outstanding as of December 31, 2010. The actual 
amounts of the debt repayments will depend on the principal and related 
accrued interest outstanding at the time of payment and may be greater than or 
less than our estimates above. 

Pending application of cash proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
temporarily in interest-bearing, short-term investment-grade securities, 
money-market accounts or checking accounts, which are consistent with our 
intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Such investments may include, for 
example, government and government agency certificates, certificates of 
deposit, interest-bearing bank deposits and mortgage loan participations. 
These initial investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we 
will seek to achieve from investments in our properties."

offering expenses payable by us, including expenses advanced by Paragon 
Shipping and reimbursed by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to partially fund the 
acquisition of our Initial Fleet and for working capital purposes. As described
below, we intend to acquire our Initial Fleet with an aggregate of $117.3

aggregate of $130.0 million under our two Credit Facilities, the drawdown of 
approximately $26.1 million under our unsecured credit facility with Paragon 
Shipping, together with 5.0 million shares of our common stock. 

At the closing of this offering, Paragon Shipping will sell to us two 3,400 TEU
2010-built containerships that it currently owns and operates in consideration 
for 2,266,600 shares of our common stock and approximately $69.2 million in 
cash from the net proceeds of this offering and borrowings under the Credit 
Facilities. We will also acquire certain inventory on board the vessels upon 
their delivery to us, which had an aggregate value as of December 31, 2010 of 
approximately $0.3 million. In addition, Paragon Shipping and Proplous 
Navigation, a company owned by Mr. Michael Bodouroglou, our Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer, have each agreed to acquire from unaffiliated 
third parties one 5,100 TEU 2007-built containership, the CMA CGM Kingfish 
and one 5,100 TEU 2007-built containership, the CMA CGM Marlin , respectively, 
that they will sell to us, subject to the completion of this offering. We will 
fund the acquisition of the CMA CGM Kingfish with 1,170,900 shares of our 
common stock and approximately $35.8 million in cash from the net proceeds of 
this offering. We will fund the acquisition of the CMA CGM Marlin with 
1,562,500 shares of our common stock, issuable to Proplous Navigation, which 
expects to nominate Neige International, a company controlled by Mr. 
Bodouroglou, to receive the shares, and approximately $29.5 million in cash 
from the net proceeds of this offering. The cash consideration payable for the 
acquisition of the CMA CGM Kingfish and the CMA CGM Marlin , respectively, 
includes amounts payable to each of Paragon Shipping and Proplous Navigation 
for the reimbursement of a purchase commission paid to Allseas, financing 
expenses, warehousing costs and other direct expenses of Paragon Shipping and 
Proplous Navigation, respectively. 

Furthermore, our Manager has agreed to acquire from unaffiliated third parties
one 4,500 TEU 2006-built containership, the MSC Siena , and one 6,500 TEU 
2010-built containership, the Maule, for a purchase price of $59.6 million and 
$79.3 million, respectively, which purchase agreements it will assign to us, 
subject to the completion of this offering. The purchase prices of the MSC 
Siena and the Maule are inclusive of a 1.0% commission payable to our Manager. 
We will fund the acquisition of these two vessels with cash from the net 
proceeds from this offering, borrowings under the Credit Facilities for which 
we have received commitment letters and amounts drawn under our unsecured 
credit facility with Paragon Shipping. 

To the extent we cannot complete the purchase of the containerships intended 
to comprise our Initial Fleet, we may use the proceeds of this offering to 
purchase other vessels or for general corporate purposes. Prior to the use of 
the net proceeds of this offering, as described above, we will invest such net 
proceeds in short-term fixed deposits. In particular, certain events may arise 
which could result in us not taking delivery of a vessel, such as a total loss 
of a vessel, a constructive total loss of a vessel, or substantial damage to a 
vessel prior to its delivery."

(1)  Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
     shares in connection with our successful consummation of our initial 
     business combination.  

(2)  In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the 
     proceeds of $175,000 of loans from our sponsor, as described in this 
     prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon consummation of this 
     offering out of the $400,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
     allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting 
     commissions, if possible. In the event that offering expenses are less 
     than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for 
     post-closing working capital expenses.  

(3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $2.0 million of 
     their underwriting commissions (or approximately $2.3 million if the 
     underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which equals 
     2.5% of the gross proceeds from the units offered to the public, until 
     consummation of initial business combination. Upon consummation of our 
     initial business combination, approximately $2.0 million, which 
     constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or approximately 
     $2.3 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
     full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust 
     account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used 
     to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
     businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for 
     general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest 
     on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
     combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
     capital.  

(4)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some 
     or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. 
     For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than 
     our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a 
     business combination based upon the level of complexity of such 
     business combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in 
     a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
     additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the 
     engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs 
     may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to 
     assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate 
     any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations 
     among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, 
     to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category 
     of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount of 
     interest available to us from the trust account may be less than $1.25 
     million as a result of the current interest rate environment. Based on 
     the current interest rate environment, we would expect approximately 
     $320,000 (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) to be 
     available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the trust 
     account; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. 
     This estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.25% per annum based upon 
     current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.  

(5)  Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
     initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and 
     commitment fees for financing.  

(6)  Reflects Sachs Capital Group LP, an affiliate of our sponsor, or our 
     sponsor, foregoing additional reimbursement for overhead expenses 
     incurred on our behalf. While not obligated to do so, Sachs Capital 
     Group LP (or our sponsor, as applicable) may elect to forego such 
     reimbursement at times where it believes amounts held outside of trust 
     may be insufficient to fund our working capital needs.  

(7)  Includes up to $180,000 ($7,500 per month) which may be paid to Sachs 
     Capital Group LP, an affiliate of our sponsor, or our sponsor, for 
     additional overhead expenses incurred on our behalf.  

A total of approximately $80 million (or approximately $91.7 million if the 
underwriters’ over- allotment option is exercised in full) of the net 
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described 
in this prospectus, including approximately $2.0 million (or approximately 
$2.3 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) 
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account 
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will 
be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 
days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries 
and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment 
Company Act. Except for a portion of the interest income that may be 
released to us to pay any income and franchise taxes and to fund our working 
capital requirements, as discussed below, and any amounts necessary to
purchase up to 15% of our public shares if we seek stockholder approval of
our business combination as will be permitted under our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation, none of the funds held in the trust account 
will be released, subject to the requirements of law, until the earlier of: 
(i) the completion of our initial business combination or 
(ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a 
business combination within 21 (or 24) months from the date of this 
prospectus.

We may increase the initial amount held in the trust account from 
approximately $10.00 per unit prior to the effectiveness of the 
registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. In such case, 
we expect that the increase would be funded by an increase in the amount of 
the deferral of the underwriting commissions payable in connection with this 
offering, the purchase of warrants by the underwriters and/or an increase in 
the number of sponsor warrants to be purchased by our sponsor at a price of 
$0.75 per warrant and/or a reduction from $600,000 of the amount initially 
available to us for working capital that is not held in the trust account 
on an equal basis. Public stockholders would own a smaller percentage of our 
outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis to the extent that our 
sponsor purchases additional warrants. We do not intend to reduce the initial 
amount to be held in the trust account. Public stockholders would own a 
smaller percentage of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
to the extent that our sponsor purchases additional warrants. We do not 
intend to reduce the initial amount to be held in the trust account. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to 
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our 
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account 
that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, 
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income 
that may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be 
sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are 
allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin 
preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an 
indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, 
depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, 
only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other 
preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. 
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence 
and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount 
necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to use from the trust 
account is less than $0.4 million as a result of the current interest rate 
environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, 
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, 
we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional 
investments from members of our management team, but such members of our 
management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or 
invest in, us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option or 
the size of this offering is increased, the maximum amount of interest 
income we may withdraw from the trust account will proportionately increase 
(for example, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
full, the size of the offering will increase by 15%, and the maximum amount 
of interest income we may withdraw from the trust account will increase to 
approximately $1.44 million). In addition, if the size of this offering is 
decreased, the maximum amount of interest income we may withdraw from the 
trust account will proportionately decrease. We will use any proportionate 
increase in interest income to cover our working capital expenses. While we 
currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and 
while they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, 
we believe that any additional interest income released to us would 
facilitate our ability to finance the exploration and consideration of a 
greater number of potential acquisition targets. 

Commencing on the date that our securities are first quoted on the OTCBB, 
we have agreed to pay Sachs Capital Group LP, an affiliate of our sponsor, 
a total of $7,500 per month for office space, administrative services and 
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Sachs Capital 
Group LP for our benefit and is not intended to provide Sachs Capital Group 
LP (or Mr. Sachs) compensation in lieu of salary or other remuneration. We 
believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained 
from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our initial business 
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. 

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned to us a total of 
$175,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These 
loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of 
December 30, 2011 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid 
upon the closing of this offering out of the $400,000 of offering proceeds 
that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the 
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the 
working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts 
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned 
amounts. Up to $800,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of 
the post business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the 
option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the sponsor 
warrants. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, 
have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to 
such loans. 

Unlike many blank check companies, if we seek stockholder approval of our 
initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection 
with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, prior 
to the consummation of a business combination, our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation will permit the release to us from the trust 
account of amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares sold in 
this offering (1,200,000 shares, or 1,380,000 shares if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) at any time commencing after the 
filing of a preliminary proxy statement for our initial business combination 
and ending on the date of the stockholder meeting to approve the initial 
business combination. Purchases will be made only in open market transactions 
at times when we are not in possession of any material non-public information 
and may not be made during a restricted period under Regulation M under the 
Exchange Act. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 
under the Exchange Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under 
certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of 
purchases. If the conditions of Rule 10b-18, as in effect at the time we 
wish to make such purchases, are not satisfied, it is likely that we will not 
make such purchases. Any purchases we make will be at prices (inclusive of 
commissions) not to exceed the per-share amount then held in the trust 
account (approximately $10.00 per share or approximately $9.97 per share if 
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). We can 
purchase any or all of the 1,200,000 shares (or 1,380,000 shares if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) we are entitled to 
purchase. It will be entirely in our discretion as to how many shares are 
purchased. Purchasing decisions will be made based on various factors, 
including the then current market price of our common stock and the terms of 
the proposed business combination. All shares purchased by us will be 
immediately cancelled. Such open market purchases, if any, would be conducted 
by us to minimize any disparity between the then current market price of our 
common stock and the per-share amount held in the trust account. A market 
price below the per-share trust amount could provide an incentive for 
purchasers to buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary proxy 
statement at a discount to the per-share amount held in the trust account 
for the sole purpose of voting against our initial business combination and 
exercising redemption rights for the full per share amount held in the trust 
account. Such trading activity could enable such investors to block a 
business combination by making it difficult for us to obtain the approval of 
such business combination by the vote of a majority of our outstanding shares 
of common stock. 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant 
to the tender offer rules, we may enter into privately negotiated 
transactions to purchase public shares from stockholders following 
consummation of the initial business combination with proceeds released to
us from the trust account immediately following consummation of the initial
business combination. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their 
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions 
either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business 
combination. Neither we nor our directors, officers, advisors or their 
affiliates will make any such purchases when we or they are in possession 
of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller. Although 
we do not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such 
public shares, in the event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in 
the best interest of those stockholders not receiving any such additional 
consideration. In addition, the payment of a premium by us after the 
consummation of our initial business combination may not be in the best 
interest of the remaining stockholders who do not redeem their shares. Such 
stockholders will experience a reduction in book value per share compared 
to the value received by stockholders that have their shares purchased by us 
at a premium. Except for the limitations described above on use of trust 
proceeds released to us prior to consummating our initial business 
combination, there is no limit on the amount of shares that could be 
acquired by us or our affiliates, or the price we or they may pay, if we
hold a stockholder vote. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause 
our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the 
redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of 
our initial business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with 
the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and instead 
may search for an alternate business combination. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust 
account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of an initial 
business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our 
common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to 
the limitations described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares 
if we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within 21 
(or 24) months following the date of this prospectus, subject to applicable 
law and as further described herein and any limitations (including but not 
limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business 
combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any 
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. 

Our sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its 
founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of a 
business combination. In addition, our sponsor has agreed to waive its 
redemption rights with respect to its founder shares if we fail to consummate 
a business combination within 21 (or 24) months from the closing of this 
offering. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or 
affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be 
entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we 
fail to consummate a business combination within the required time 
period."

and corresponding Warrants we are offering will be approximately $10.0 million,
or $11.7 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in 
full, and after deducting underwriting discount and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes for this offering are to fund our product development 
activities, including clinical trials for our most advanced product candidates,
EPODURE, INFRADURE and HEMODURE, for patent maintenance fees and intellectual 
property support and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, 
which may include the acquisition or licensing of complementary technologies, 
products or business. 

We anticipate using the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

 •  approximately $3.4 million for EPODURE development to include the 
    following:  

 •  completion of the phase I/II trial,  

 •  pre-IND and IND for EPODURE and/or other indications; and  

 •  preparations and approval to commence phase 2b (dose ranging clinical 
    trial);  

 •  approximately $1.8 million for INFRADURE development in preparation for 
    phase I trial in humans;  

 •  approximately $0.5 million for HEMODURE development;  

 •  approximately $1.7 million for research and development of core technology 
    and other product candidates;  

 •  approximately $0.5 million for patent maintenance fees and other 
    intellectual property support; and  

 •  approximately $2.1 million to fund working capital and other general 
    corporate purposes, which may include the acquisition or licensing of 
    complementary technologies, products or business.  

We have no current plans, agreements or commitments for any material 
acquisitions or licenses of any technologies, products or businesses. 

We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, along with our existing 
cash resources, will be sufficient to enable us to take the following actions 
for at least the 12 months following the closing of this offering: 

 •  complete phase I/II clinical trials program for EPODURE in anemic patients 
    with chronic kidney disease and seek IND approval and make other pre-trial 
    preparations for a phase II clinical trial in patients with renal anemia;  

 •  prepare, launch and obtain initial data from a phase I/II clinical trials 
    program for INFRADURE in patients with hepatitis C;  

 •  further develop our HEMODURE Biopump in an effort to increase production 
    and delivery of Factor VIII in amounts sufficient to warrant clinical 
    testing in patients;  

 •  pursue strategic alliances, including the license of our technologies;  

 •  further develop our core technology; and  

 •  initiate development of additional applications with other proteins.  

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our intentions 
based on our current plans and business conditions. As a result, we will retain
broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds of this 
offering. Although we believe the proceeds from the 2010 Debentures and the 
proceeds from this offering should be sufficient to meet our operating and 
capital requirements for at least 12 months after the closing of this offering,
we believe that we will continue to need to raise funds in the future through 
debt or equity offerings in order to maintain and support our business plan. 

The actual cost, timing and amount of funds required for such uses cannot be 
determined precisely at this time, and may be based on economic, regulatory, 
competitive or other developments, the rate of our progress in research and 
development, the results of proposed preclinical studies and clinical trials, 
the timing of regulatory approvals, if any, payments under collaborative 
agreements and the availability of alternative methods of financings. Other 
future events, including the problems, delays, expenses and complications 
frequently encountered by development stage companies and biotechnology 
companies in particular, as well as changes in our planned business and the 
success (or lack thereof) of our research, development and testing activities, 
may make shifts in the allocation of funds necessary or desirable. Our 
management has discretion in the application of the proceeds of this offering, 
and the proceeds may be used for corporate purposes with which you may 
disagree. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest
the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing investment grade securities."

 •  further develop our HEMODURE Biopump in an effort to increase production 
    and delivery of Factor VIII in amounts sufficient to warrant clinical 
    testing in patients;  

 •  pursue strategic alliances, including the license of our technologies;  

 •  further develop our core technology; and  

 •  initiate development of additional applications with other proteins.  

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our intentions 
based on our current plans and business conditions. As a result, we will retain
broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds of this 
offering. Although we believe the proceeds from the 2010 Debentures and the 
proceeds from this offering should be sufficient to meet our operating and 
capital requirements for at least 12 months after the closing of this offering,
we believe that we will continue to need to raise funds in the future through 
debt or equity offerings in order to maintain and support our business plan. 

The actual cost, timing and amount of funds required for such uses cannot be 
determined precisely at this time, and may be based on economic, regulatory, 
competitive or other developments, the rate of our progress in research and 
development, the results of proposed preclinical studies and clinical trials, 
the timing of regulatory approvals, if any, payments under collaborative 
agreements and the availability of alternative methods of financings. Other 
future events, including the problems, delays, expenses and complications 
frequently encountered by development stage companies and biotechnology 
companies in particular, as well as changes in our planned business and the 
success (or lack thereof) of our research, development and testing activities, 
may make shifts in the allocation of funds necessary or desirable. Our 
management has discretion in the application of the proceeds of this offering, 
and the proceeds may be used for corporate purposes with which you may 
disagree. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest
the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing investment grade securities."

sale of common units by us in this offering, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and the estimated expenses of this offering. We 
intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 
   
   •   approximately $18.4 million will be distributed to Coffeyville 
Resources to satisfy our obligation to reimburse it for certain capital 
expenditures it made on our behalf with respect to the nitrogen fertilizer 
business prior to October 24, 2007;  
   
   •   approximately $69.3 million will be used to make a special distribution 
to Coffeyville Resources in order to, among other things, fund the offer to 
purchase Coffeyville Resources’ senior secured notes required upon 
consummation of this offering;  
   
   •   approximately $26.0 million will be used to purchase (and subsequently 
extinguish) the incentive distribution rights currently owned by our general 
partner;  
   
   •   approximately $3.0 million will be used by us to pay financing fees 
in connection with entering into our new credit facility; and  
   
   •   the balance will be used for general partnership purposes, including 
approximately $104.0 million to fund the intended approximately $135.0 
million UAN expansion, for which approximately $31.0 million had been 
spent as of December 31, 2010.  

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 2,880,000 additional 
common units in full, the additional net proceeds to us would be 
approximately $42.9 million (and the total net proceeds to us would be 
approximately $324.6 million). The net proceeds from any exercise of such 
option will also be paid as a special distribution to Coffeyville 
Resources. If the option is exercised in full and closed on the same 
date as this offering, the special distribution we make to Coffeyville 
Resources from the proceeds of our term loan will be reduced from $92.1 
million to $87.2 million, and the special distribution we make to 
Coffeyville Resources from the proceeds of this offering will be 
increased from $69.3 million to $74.2 million."

common stock in this offering of approximately $48.2 million, or $53.7 
million if the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option, 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds as follows: 

•  approximately $20.5 million of these net proceeds to fund the continued 
   clinical development of ulimorelin , including our two Phase 3 clinical 
   trials for the management of postoperative ileus following partial bowel 
   resection surgery; 

•  approximately $14.2 million of these net proceeds to fund the continued 
   clinical development of TZP-102, including our planned 12-week Phase 2b 
   clinical trial for the treatment of gastroparesis in diabetic patients; and

•  the remainder for general corporate purposes, such as payment of principal 
   and interest under our debt facilities, general and administrative expenses,
   capital expenditures, working capital, prosecution and maintenance of our 
   intellectual property and the potential investment in technologies or 
   products that complement our business. 

We have no current understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to 
any acquisition of or investment in any technologies or products. 

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds as described
above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of funds may be 
necessary. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon 
numerous factors, including the progress of our development and 
commercialization efforts, the progress of our clinical trials, whether or not 
we enter into strategic collaborations or partnerships and our operating costs 
and expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility
in applying these net proceeds. 

We believe that the amounts allocated to the clinical development of ulimorelin
and TZP-102 set forth above will be sufficient to complete the Phase 3 trials 
and Phase 2b trial described above, respectively; however, the costs and timing
of drug development and regulatory approval, particularly conducting clinical 
trials, are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial risks and can often 
change. Accordingly, we may require more capital than currently anticipated or 
may change the allocation of use of these proceeds as a result of contingencies
such as the progress and results of our clinical trials and other development 
activities, the establishment of collaborations, our manufacturing requirements
and regulatory or competitive developments. 

Pending use of the proceeds as described above or otherwise, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing, investment-grade 
securities."

on the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 

In connection with the Refinancing, Centers used a portion of the net proceeds 
from the Term Loan Facility, together with cash on hand, to pay a dividend to 
Holdings of $185.0 million and to make a contribution to GNC Funding of $85.0 
million, which amount GNC Funding then loaned to Holdings. We expect to use 
such amounts, together with the net proceeds we receive from this offering and 
cash on hand of $26.0 million, to: 

• redeem all of our outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock immediately 
  following completion of this offering at a redemption price per share of 
  $5.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date, 
  representing an aggregate redemption price of approximately $222.5 million, 

• contribute $300.0 million to Centers to repay outstanding borrowings under 
  its Term Loan Facility, and 

• apply approximately $11.1 million to satisfy our obligations under the ACOF 
  Management Services Agreement and the Class B common stock. 

The per share amount of accrued and unpaid dividends of our Series A preferred 
stock will be $2.47. 

Ares, OTPP and members of management hold substantially all of our outstanding 
Series A preferred stock and, therefore, will receive substantially all of the 
cash paid to redeem such stock. 

As of the date hereof, the Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate per 
annum of 4.25% and will mature in March 2018. Centers used a portion of the net
proceeds from such indebtedness to refinance its former indebtedness, to fund 
amounts to Holdings and to pay related fees and expenses, each as described 
above. Funds affiliated with Ares hold approximately 10% of the outstanding 
loans under the Senior Credit Facility and will receive funds representing 
their pro rata portion of such loans. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by 
the selling stockholders."

 (3)  Assumes offering expenses of $2.6 million (including legal, accounting, 
      printing and other expenses of the offering, and the advisory fee and 
      expense reimbursements payable to International Assets Advisory, LLC) and
      organizational costs of approximately $0.4 million.  

 (4)  Includes prepaid interest, points, loan commitment fees and legal and

 (5)  “Real Estate Commissions” are defined as the total of all fees and 
      commissions paid by any person to any person, including our manager or

      development of any property by us, whether designated as real estate 
      commission, acquisition fees, finders fees, selection fees, development 
      fees, construction fees, non-recurring management fees, consulting fees 
      or any other similar fees or commissions howsoever designated and 
      howsoever treated for tax or accounting purposes. No Real Estate 
      Commissions are being paid in connection with the purchase of the 
      acquired properties other than the acquisition fee that will be paid to 
      our manager pursuant to our management agreement with the manager.

We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from selling our common stock
in the underwritten offering will be approximately $39.8 million in the 
aggregate, or $46.1 million in the aggregate if the underwriters fully exercise
their over-allotment option, based upon an initial public offering price of 
$10.00 per share, in each case, and after deducting applicable underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses (including the 
advisory fee and expense reimbursements payable to International Assets 
Advisory, LLC), of approximately $4.8 million, or $5.3 million if the 
underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option and after deducting 
estimated organizational costs of approximately $0.4 million. We estimate that 
the net proceeds we will receive from selling our common stock in the private 
placement offering will be approximately $4.7 million in the aggregate, based 
upon the private placement offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting 
applicable estimated organizational costs and offering expenses of 
approximately $0.3 million. The total net proceeds that we estimate we will 
receive from the private placement offering and the underwritten offering, 
after deducting applicable underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses (including the advisory fee and expense reimbursements 
payable to International Assets Advisory, LLC), will be approximately $44.5 
million, or $50.8 million if the underwriters fully exercise their over-
allotment option. 

We intend to invest the net proceeds to us of the private placement offering 
and the underwritten offering of our common stock in properties with an 
aggregate gross value (inclusive of mortgage indebtedness) of approximately 
$127.2 million, or $145.1 million if the underwriters fully exercise their 
over-allotment option, including the two real estate investments that have been
identified for potential acquisition. We intend to acquire properties through 
the incurrence of indebtedness (secured and unsecured) constituting 
approximately 65% of our tangible assets value on a portfolio basis, with the 
balance of the acquisition cost thereof funded through the use of the net 
proceeds to us of the private placement and underwritten offering. Neither our 
charter nor our by-laws contain any limitation on the amount of leverage we may
use. Our investment guidelines, which can be amended by our board without 
stockholder approval, limit our borrowings (secured and unsecured) to 75% of 
the cost of our tangible assets at the time of any new borrowing. 

We have entered into purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of two 
properties with third parties affiliated with our manager, i.e. (a) Oxford Rise
Partners LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, and WOF for the acquisition 
of Oxford Rise JV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and (b) Oxford 
Summit Development, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, and Williams 
Realty Fund I, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, for the acquisition 
of Oxford Summit Partners, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company. The 
acquisition price for each property was determined pursuant to the appraisals 
of two independent real estate appraisers. It is expected that these 
acquisitions will be consummated shortly after the completion of the offerings.
We anticipate that the aggregate purchase price for the two properties, 
together with acquisition fees and other expenses, (approximately $65.9 
million), will be paid with approximately $24.8 million from the proceeds of 
the offerings, with the balance thereof being paid from planned debt financing 
activities. While currently we do not have any financing commitments in place 
in connection with the acquisitions of the two properties, upon completion of 
the offerings we expect to execute commitment letters with either Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac and pay a fee equal to 2% of the loan proceeds for each of the two 
loans, which payments will be reimbursed to us at the closing of each loan. If 
first mortgage financing is unavailable from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, we plan
to prioritize the acquisition of the two properties and use the proceeds from 
the offering to acquire the Oxford Rise property. 

In addition, we expect to repay amounts borrowed from WOF pursuant to three 
separate financing arrangements that aggregate approximately $1.8 million.

Our manager may invest net proceeds of the private placement offering and the 
underwritten offering in interest-bearing short-term investments that are 
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT, pending investment in our 
target assets. These initial investments are expected to provide a lower net 
return than we will seek to achieve from our target assets."

first mortgage financing is unavailable from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, we plan
to prioritize the acquisition of the two properties and use the proceeds from 
the offering to acquire the Oxford Rise property. 

In addition, we expect to repay amounts borrowed from WOF pursuant to three 
separate financing arrangements that aggregate approximately $1.8 million.

Our manager may invest net proceeds of the private placement offering and the 
underwritten offering in interest-bearing short-term investments that are 
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT, pending investment in our 
target assets. These initial investments are expected to provide a lower net 
return than we will seek to achieve from our target assets."

in the underwritten offering on a firm commitment basis at the initial public 
offering price of $10.00 per share, of which 690,000 shares of our common stock
are being offered to Williams Realty Fund I, LLC and 500,000 shares of our 
common stock are being offered to WOF, each of which is an affiliate of our 
sponsor, through our directed share program without payment of underwriting 
discounts and commissions by us other than $0.14 per share as an underwriting 
fee. Immediately prior to the closing of the underwritten offering, we will 
complete the irrevocable private placement offering to WOF of 500,000 shares 
of our common stock, without payment of underwriting discounts and commissions

 (1)  Assumes the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option.

 (2)  Assumes the sale in the underwritten offering of 690,000 shares of our 
      common stock to Williams Realty Fund I, LLC and 500,000 shares of our 
      common stock to Williams Opportunity Fund, LLC without payment by the 
      Company of any underwriting discounts or commissions other than $0.14 per
      share as an underwriting fee.  

 (3)  Assumes offering expenses of $2.6 million (including legal, accounting, 
      printing and other expenses of the offering, and the advisory fee and 
      expense reimbursements payable to International Assets Advisory, LLC) and
      organizational costs of approximately $0.4 million.  

 (4)  Includes prepaid interest, points, loan commitment fees and legal and 
      other costs of acquisition. The percentage of such items to be 
      capitalized is 20.42%.  

 (5)  “Real Estate Commissions” are defined as the total of all fees and 
      commissions paid by any person to any person, including our manager or 
      affiliates, in connection with the selection, purchase, construction or 
      development of any property by us, whether designated as real estate 
      commission, acquisition fees, finders fees, selection fees, development 
      fees, construction fees, non-recurring management fees, consulting fees 
      or any other similar fees or commissions howsoever designated and 
      howsoever treated for tax or accounting purposes. No Real Estate 
      Commissions are being paid in connection with the purchase of the 
      acquired properties other than the acquisition fee that will be paid to 
      our manager pursuant to our management agreement with the manager.

We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from selling our common stock
in the underwritten offering will be approximately $39.8 million in the 
aggregate, or $46.1 million in the aggregate if the underwriters fully exercise
their over-allotment option, based upon an initial public offering price of 
$10.00 per share, in each case, and after deducting applicable underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses (including the 
advisory fee and expense reimbursements payable to International Assets 
Advisory, LLC), of approximately $4.8 million, or $5.3 million if the 
underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option and after deducting 
estimated organizational costs of approximately $0.4 million. We estimate that 
the net proceeds we will receive from selling our common stock in the private 
placement offering will be approximately $4.7 million in the aggregate, based 
upon the private placement offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting 
applicable estimated organizational costs and offering expenses of 
approximately $0.3 million. The total net proceeds that we estimate we will 
receive from the private placement offering and the underwritten offering, 
after deducting applicable underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses (including the advisory fee and expense reimbursements 
payable to International Assets Advisory, LLC), will be approximately $44.5 
million, or $50.8 million if the underwriters fully exercise their over-
allotment option. 

We intend to invest the net proceeds to us of the private placement offering 
and the underwritten offering of our common stock in properties with an 
aggregate gross value (inclusive of mortgage indebtedness) of approximately 
$127.2 million, or $145.1 million if the underwriters fully exercise their 
over-allotment option, including the two real estate investments that have been
identified for potential acquisition. We intend to acquire properties through 
the incurrence of indebtedness (secured and unsecured) constituting 
approximately 65% of our tangible assets value on a portfolio basis, with the 
balance of the acquisition cost thereof funded through the use of the net 
proceeds to us of the private placement and underwritten offering. Neither our 
charter nor our by-laws contain any limitation on the amount of leverage we may
use. Our investment guidelines, which can be amended by our board without 
stockholder approval, limit our borrowings (secured and unsecured) to 75% of 
the cost of our tangible assets at the time of any new borrowing. 

We have entered into purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of two 
properties with third parties affiliated with our manager, i.e. (a) Oxford Rise
Partners LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, and WOF for the acquisition 
of Oxford Rise JV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and (b) Oxford 
Summit Development, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, and Williams 
Realty Fund I, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, for the acquisition 
of Oxford Summit Partners, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company. The 
acquisition price for each property was determined pursuant to the appraisals 
of two independent real estate appraisers. It is expected that these 
acquisitions will be consummated shortly after the completion of the offerings.
We anticipate that the aggregate purchase price for the two properties, 
together with acquisition fees and other expenses, (approximately $65.9 
million), will be paid with approximately $24.8 million from the proceeds of 
the offerings, with the balance thereof being paid from planned debt financing 
activities. While currently we do not have any financing commitments in place 
in connection with the acquisitions of the two properties, upon completion of 
the offerings we expect to execute commitment letters with either Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac and pay a fee equal to 2% of the loan proceeds for each of the two 
loans, which payments will be reimbursed to us at the closing of each loan. If 
first mortgage financing is unavailable from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, we plan
to prioritize the acquisition of the two properties and use the proceeds from 
the offering to acquire the Oxford Rise property. 

In addition, we expect to repay amounts borrowed from WOF pursuant to three 
separate financing arrangements that aggregate approximately $1.8 million.

Our manager may invest net proceeds of the private placement offering and the 
underwritten offering in interest-bearing short-term investments that are 
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT, pending investment in our 
target assets. These initial investments are expected to provide a lower net 
return than we will seek to achieve from our target assets."

 (1)  A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, 
the FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
from the funds we received from Xuesong Song described below. These funds will
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.  

 (2)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase 
of the insider warrants. Represents 2.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale 
of units in this offering. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting 
discount is reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon 
consummation of this offering.  

 (3)  Includes up to approximately $1,125,000, or up to approximately 
$1,293,750 if the over-allotment is exercised in full, representing the 2.25% 
discount payable only on monies in trust which are not redeemed and which 
remain in the trust account following the consummation of our initial 
business combination. Also includes $1,125,000, or $1,293,750 if the 
over-allotment is exercised in full, representing 2.25% discount payable on 
any units sold pursuant to the over-allotment option, which is payable to the 
underwriters in our sole discretion following consummation of our initial 
business combination.  

 (4)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust initially will be $725,000 
even if the over-allotment is exercised. These expenses are estimates only. 
Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the 
estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and 
accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating 
and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of 
such business combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in 
a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional 
expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special 
legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we 
may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses. 
To the extent any such fluctuation results in a higher expenditure on any 
specific category of expenses than our current estimates, we will have less 
money to cover our expenses in other categories. The amount of interest 
available to us from the trust account may be less than $605,000 as a result 
of the current interest rate environment.  

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Chum Capital Group 
Limited and Mr. Xuechu He and Mr. Teng Zhou, two of our directors, have 
committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price 
of $2,975,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a private placement 
basis on the date of this prospectus. We will not pay any discounts or 
commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider warrants. All of the 
proceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in the trust account. 

$50,250,000, or $57,562,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, including the $2,975,000 we will receive 
from the sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account with
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas in the United States and maintained by 
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. 
This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts and commissions 
payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have agreed 
that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate our initial 
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon 
our liquidation if we are unable to complete our initial business combination.
The funds held in trust will be invested only in U.S. “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting 
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. government treasury bills with 
a maturity of 180 days or less, so that we are not deemed to be an investment 
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (1) any 
interest income that may be released to us from the trust account to pay our 
income or other tax obligations relating to interest income earned and for 
working capital requirements, and (2) any amounts necessary to purchase up 
to 15% of the shares sold in the offering, the proceeds will not be released 
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial 
business combination and our liquidation. If the underwriters determine the 
size of this offering should be increased or decreased, such an increase or 
decrease in offering size could also result in a proportionate increase or 
decrease in the amount of interest we may withdraw from the trust account. 
The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business 
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the 
target business may be used to finance operations of the target business. 

We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $10,000 to Chum Capital Group Limited, 
an affiliate of Messrs. Song, our Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and 
Shi, our Chief Executive Officer, for office space, utilities and general and 
administrative services, including but not limited to receptionist, 
secretarial and general office services. This agreement commences on the date 
of this prospectus and shall continue until the earlier of the consummation 
of our initial business combination and the winding-up and liquidation of our 
company. 

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar 
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, 
or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in 
order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination 
(regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals 
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses 
and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, 
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their 
operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the
funds not held in trust and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and 
other third-party expenses attendant to the search for target businesses and 
to the due diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation of our 
initial business combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses
by our officers, directors and initial shareholders” and “Working capital to 
cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, 
liquidation obligations and reserves.” Since the role of present management 
after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine 
what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net 
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working 
capital requirements in searching for a business combination will initially 
be approximately $725,000. In addition, all of the interest earned on the 
funds held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest
income) may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in 
searching for a business combination. We intend to use the excess working 
capital available for miscellaneous expenses for director and officer 
liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the 
event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and 
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for 
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial 
shareholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. 
We will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account released to us to pay any income tax obligations that we may 
owe. Additionally, amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares 
sold in this offering may be released from the trust at any time commencing 
upon the filing of a proxy statement related to an initial business 
combination and ending on the date immediately prior to the record date for 
the vote held to approve an initial business combination. Such purchases will
only be permitted in the event that we seek shareholder approval of 
a business combination. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover 
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of 
the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us 
with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund 
a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep 
target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other 
companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect 
to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any 
current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid 
for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that 
would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be 
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the 
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds 
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not 
having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence
with respect to additional potential target businesses. 

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust 
account, along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account (net of income taxes), represents our best estimate of the 
intended uses of these funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be 
inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described 
categories. 

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, 
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business 
and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital 
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial 
business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not 
used to consummate our initial business combination or paid to redeeming 
shareholders will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with 
any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance 
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be 
used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target 
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research 
and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used 
to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior 
to the completion of our initial business combination if the funds available 
to us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

Xuesong Song has advanced to us $200,000 which was used to pay a portion of 
the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC 
registration fee, FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees 
and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the consummation 
of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
available to us for payment of offering expenses. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the 
trust account) to operate for the next 21 months, assuming that our initial 
business combination is not consummated during that time. 

A public shareholder (but not our existing shareholders with respect to any 
of our founder shares owned immediately prior to the consummation of this 
offering) will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including 
interest earned on such shareholder’s portion of the trust account, net of

 (1)  A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, 
the FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
from the funds we received from Xuesong Song described below. These funds will
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.  

 (2)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase 
of the insider warrants. Represents 2.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale 
of units in this offering. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting 
discount is reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon 
consummation of this offering.  

 (3)  Includes up to approximately $1,125,000, or up to approximately 
$1,293,750 if the over-allotment is exercised in full, representing the 2.25% 
discount payable only on monies in trust which are not redeemed and which 
remain in the trust account following the consummation of our initial 
business combination. Also includes $1,125,000, or $1,293,750 if the 
over-allotment is exercised in full, representing 2.25% discount payable on 
any units sold pursuant to the over-allotment option, which is payable to the 
underwriters in our sole discretion following consummation of our initial 
business combination.  

 (4)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust initially will be $725,000 
even if the over-allotment is exercised. These expenses are estimates only. 
Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the 
estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and 
accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating 
and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of 
such business combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in 
a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional 
expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special 
legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we 
may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses. 
To the extent any such fluctuation results in a higher expenditure on any 
specific category of expenses than our current estimates, we will have less 
money to cover our expenses in other categories. The amount of interest 
available to us from the trust account may be less than $605,000 as a result 
of the current interest rate environment.  

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Chum Capital Group 
Limited and Mr. Xuechu He and Mr. Teng Zhou, two of our directors, have 
committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price 
of $2,975,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a private placement 
basis on the date of this prospectus. We will not pay any discounts or 
commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider warrants. All of the 
proceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in the trust account. 

$50,250,000, or $57,562,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, including the $2,975,000 we will receive 
from the sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account with
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas in the United States and maintained by 
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. 
This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts and commissions 
payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have agreed 
that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate our initial 
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon 
our liquidation if we are unable to complete our initial business combination.
The funds held in trust will be invested only in U.S. “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting 
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. government treasury bills with 
a maturity of 180 days or less, so that we are not deemed to be an investment 
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (1) any 
interest income that may be released to us from the trust account to pay our 
income or other tax obligations relating to interest income earned and for 
working capital requirements, and (2) any amounts necessary to purchase up 
to 15% of the shares sold in the offering, the proceeds will not be released 
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial 
business combination and our liquidation. If the underwriters determine the 
size of this offering should be increased or decreased, such an increase or 
decrease in offering size could also result in a proportionate increase or 
decrease in the amount of interest we may withdraw from the trust account. 
The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business 
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the 
target business may be used to finance operations of the target business. 

We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $10,000 to Chum Capital Group Limited, 
an affiliate of Messrs. Song, our Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and 
Shi, our Chief Executive Officer, for office space, utilities and general and 
administrative services, including but not limited to receptionist, 
secretarial and general office services. This agreement commences on the date 
of this prospectus and shall continue until the earlier of the consummation 
of our initial business combination and the winding-up and liquidation of our 
company. 

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar 
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, 
or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in 
order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination 
(regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals 
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses 
and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, 
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their 
operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the
funds not held in trust and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and 
other third-party expenses attendant to the search for target businesses and 
to the due diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation of our 
initial business combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses
by our officers, directors and initial shareholders” and “Working capital to 
cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, 
liquidation obligations and reserves.” Since the role of present management 
after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine 
what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net 
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working 
capital requirements in searching for a business combination will initially 
be approximately $725,000. In addition, all of the interest earned on the 
funds held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest
income) may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in 
searching for a business combination. We intend to use the excess working 
capital available for miscellaneous expenses for director and officer 
liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the 
event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and 
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for 
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial 
shareholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. 
We will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account released to us to pay any income tax obligations that we may 
owe. Additionally, amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares 
sold in this offering may be released from the trust at any time commencing 
upon the filing of a proxy statement related to an initial business 
combination and ending on the date immediately prior to the record date for 
the vote held to approve an initial business combination. Such purchases will
only be permitted in the event that we seek shareholder approval of 
a business combination. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover 
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of 
the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us 
with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund 
a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep 
target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other 
companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect 
to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any 
current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid 
for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that 
would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be 
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the 
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds 
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not 
having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence
with respect to additional potential target businesses. 

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust 
account, along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account (net of income taxes), represents our best estimate of the 
intended uses of these funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be 
inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described 
categories. 

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, 
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business 
and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital 
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial 
business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not 
used to consummate our initial business combination or paid to redeeming 
shareholders will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with 
any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance 
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be 
used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target 
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research 
and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used 
to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior 
to the completion of our initial business combination if the funds available 
to us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

Xuesong Song has advanced to us $200,000 which was used to pay a portion of 
the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC 
registration fee, FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees 
and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the consummation 
of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
available to us for payment of offering expenses. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the 
trust account) to operate for the next 21 months, assuming that our initial 
business combination is not consummated during that time. 

A public shareholder (but not our existing shareholders with respect to any 
of our founder shares owned immediately prior to the consummation of this 
offering) will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including 
interest earned on such shareholder’s portion of the trust account, net of
taxes payable and amounts of trust account interest we are permitted to draw 
for working capital) only in the event of the liquidation of the trust 
account as part of our liquidation upon our failure to complete our initial 
business combination, or if such public shareholder redeems their ordinary 
shares for cash in connection with a business combination that the public 
shareholder voted against and which was actually approved or the public 
shareholder voted in favor of and elected redemption or with respect to 
a business combination which is consummated. In no other circumstances will 
a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the 
trust account. Our existing shareholders, directors and officers are not 
entitled to redeem any of their ordinary shares acquired prior to this 
offering for a cash portion of the trust account."
"TERRAVIA HOLDINGS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/terravia-holdings-inc-657474-66563,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/terravia-holdings-inc-657474-66563,424B4,5/27/2011,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7963061,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $169.6 million 
from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, or 
approximately $197.2 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares of common stock to cover any over-allotment in 
full, based on the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share and 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the 
shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders. 

The principal purposes for this offering are to fund research and development 
activities, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for 
other general corporate purposes. We intend to accelerate our commercial 
strategy in multiple geographies, which includes accessing feedstock 
arrangements and establishing manufacturing capacity with partners in 
which we may invest capital when the returns are justified. We may also 
use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, 
companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our business. 
However, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to 
enter into any potential acquisitions or investments. We cannot currently 
allocate specific percentages of the net proceeds that we may use for the 
purposes described above. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in the
use of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds in 
ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of 
our common stock."
"FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR, LTD.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/freescale-semiconductor-ltd-748380-66346,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/freescale-semiconductor-ltd-748380-66346,424B4,5/26/2011,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=7961353,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our common shares in 
this offering will be $742 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Our net proceeds 
will increase by approximately $112 million if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full.

We intend to contribute the net proceeds from this offering to Freescale, 
Inc., our indirect wholly owned subsidiary and main U.S. operating entity. 
We expect Freescale Inc. to use the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, 
to repay an aggregate of approximately $888 million in outstanding 
indebtedness as described below; to pay approximately $4 million in fees and 
expenses in connection with the senior credit facilities amendment; and to 
make a payment to our Sponsors in connection with the termination of the 
Management Fee Agreements as follows: $33.6 million to Blackstone 
Management Partners V L.L.C., $10.8 million to TC Group IV, L.L.C., $6.5 
million to Permira Advisors (London) Limited, $6.5 million to Permira 
Advisers LLC, $6.7 million to TPG GenPar V—AIV, L.P. and $2.9 million to TPG 
GenPar IV—AIV, L.P.

We currently expect to repay the following indebtedness:

• the full amount of indebtedness outstanding under the existing revolving
  credit facility upon completion of this offering ($532 million at April 30,
   2011);

• $93 million principal amount of 9.125%/9.875% Senior PIK-Election Notes due
   2014; and

• $263 million principal amount of 10.75% Senior Notes due 2020.

The actual amount to be repaid under the existing revolving credit facility
will depend on the amount outstanding upon completion of this offering,
although we currently do not expect to have any additional amounts 
outstanding. Freescale Inc. currently expects to redeem each of the foregoing 
amounts and series of notes thirty days following completion of this offering 
pursuant to the applicable redemption provisions set forth in the applicable 
indentures. Assuming repayment of the existing credit facility upon completion
of this offering and the redemption of the notes as specified above, 
Freescale Inc. would pay an additional $46 million in estimated accrued 
interest and premiums, all of which will be paid with available cash. 
Although the foregoing represents Freescale Inc.’s current intentions with 
respect to the repayment of its outstanding notes, the actual series of notes 
to be repaid, the amount to be repaid under each series, the timing of 
repayment and the method of repayment may change depending upon pricing terms 
available for each method of repayment, which could include redemptions, open 
market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or tender offers, or some 
combination thereof. Regardless of such changes among series to be repaid or 
to the timing and method of repayment, we would still intend to use such
amount of net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay an aggregate of 
approximately $888 million of indebtedness. There are no alternative intended
uses for such net proceeds. The foregoing does not constitute a notice of 
redemption for or an obligation to issue a notice of redemption for or an 
offer to repurchase any of the outstanding notes. In the event that Freescale 
Inc. elects to exercise its redemption rights, the appropriate notice or 
notices of redemption will be issued at a later date or dates upon the terms 
and conditions set forth in the applicable indentures.

After giving effect to the above repayments, on an As Adjusted Basis as of 
April 1, 2011, our existing revolving credit facility would have been 
terminated, and our new revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity 
of $425 million (subject to increase to $500 million in certain 
circumstances), would have been undrawn (without giving effect to $25 million 
in letters of credit). The new revolving credit facility will be available 
through July 1, 2016, subject to acceleration to September 1, 2014 if (a) on 
such date the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Freescale Inc.’s 
senior unsecured notes due 2014 exceeds $500 million and (b) Freescale Inc.’s
total leverage ratio for the June 30, 2014 test period is greater than 4:1. 
In addition, after giving effect to the above repayments, on an As Adjusted 
Basis as of April 1, 2011, we would have had (1) $2,230 million outstanding 
under a term loan due December 1, 2016, which maturity accelerates to 
September 1, 2014 if (a) on such date the aggregate outstanding principal 
amount of Freescale Inc.’s senior unsecured notes due 2014 exceeds $500 
million and (b) Freescale Inc.’s total leverage ratio for the June 30, 2014 
test period is greater than 4:1, and (2) the following amounts outstanding 
under our senior notes: $57 million aggregate principal amount of Senior 
Floating Rate Notes due 2014; $162 million under our 9.125%/9.875% Senior 
PIK-Election Notes due 2014; $886 million aggregate principal amount of
8.875% Senior Fixed Rate Notes due 2014; $764 million aggregate principal 
amount of 10.125% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016; $750 million aggregate 
principal amount of 10.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2018; $1,380 million 
aggregate principal amount of 9.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2018; and $487 
million aggregate principal amount of 10.75% Senior Notes due 2020. 
Accordingly, we would have had $1,105 million aggregate principal amount of 
senior unsecured notes due 2014 outstanding on an As Adjusted Basis as of 
April 1, 2011, or $605 million in excess of the threshold for acceleration of
indebtedness under our senior credit facilities as described above. In the 
event the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in whole or in 
part, we currently expect to contribute the net proceeds therefrom to 
Freescale Inc. to enable it to repay additional amounts outstanding under 
the 9.125%/9.875% Senior PIK-Election Notes due 2014.

The net proceeds of the 10.125% Senior Secured Notes due March 15, 2018,
the 9.25% Senior Secured Notes due April 15, 2018 and the 10.75% Senior Notes 
due August 1, 2020 were used to repay outstanding indebtedness. As of April 1,
2011, the interest rate applicable to the Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2014 
was 4.18%, and the interest rate applicable to the revolving credit facility,
which matures on December 1, 2012, was 2.26%.

None of our Sponsor or our other affiliates hold balances under Freescale 
Inc.’s revolving credit facility nor do they hold debt securities of Freescale
Inc. Accordingly, other than the payment to our Sponsors in connection with 
the termination of the Management Fee Agreements as described above, none of 
our Sponsors or our other affiliates will receive any of the net proceeds 
from this offering.

Certain of the underwriters or their affiliates currently hold balances under 
Freescale Inc.’s revolving credit facility and debt securities of Freescale 
Inc. As a result, based on amounts outstanding as of April 30, 2011, and 
assuming the above repayments, the following underwriters and their respective
affiliates would receive net proceeds from this offering as follows:

(a)   Our new bank credit facility will become effective immediately prior to 
      the completion of this offering and will replace the existing CFOL bank 
      credit facility. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
      in full, we expect to borrow $219 million under our bank credit facility.
      As of May 9, 2011, we had approximately $9.3 million in borrowings 
      outstanding under our existing bank credit facility. We intend to 
      refinance borrowings under our existing bank credit facility with 
      borrowings under our new bank credit facility. On a pro forma basis, as 
      of May 9, 2011, after giving effect to this offering, the application of 
      the net proceeds therefrom, the related transactions. We estimate that we
      would have had $255.8 million in borrowings under our bank credit 
      facility. 

(b)   Under the separation and distribution agreement, we have agreed to use a 
      portion of the net proceeds from this offering to pay $29 million to 
      Forest as partial consideration for the contribution of CFOL and the 
      Wiser Entities to us. In addition, we have agreed to use the remaining 
      net proceeds from this offering and borrowings under our bank credit 
      facility to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness to Forest,
      including amounts due to Forest under the promissory note and 
      intercompany advances and accrued interest. As of March 31, 2011, we had 
      approximately $284 million of intercompany debt payable to Forest under 
      the promissory note and $44 million of intercompany advances and accrued 
      interest due to Forest. As of May 9, 2011, we had approximately $354 
      million of intercompany debt payable to Forest, which includes additional
      borrowings used by us to complete the acquisition of certain gas 
      properties in our Narraway/Ojay fields on April 29, 2011 for 
      approximately CDN$75 million, under the promissory note, and $45 million 
      of intercompany advances and accrued interest due to Forest. 

(c)    Excludes $3.9 million of third-party costs related to this offering, 
      which third-party costs are included in estimated offering expenses. 

We have up to $500 million of availability under the promissory note payable to
Forest, under which $284 million was outstanding as of March 31, 2011. As of 
May 9, 2011, we had approximately $354 million of intercompany debt payable to 
Forest, which includes additional borrowings used by us to complete the 
acquisition of certain gas properties in our Narraway/Ojay fields on April 29, 
2011 for approximately CDN$75 million, under the promissory note. The 
promissory note is due on demand or, failing such demand, in November 2014. The
interest rate charged on borrowings under the promissory note is three-month 
LIBOR plus a multiple of Forest's credit default swap rate, with such interest 
rate being reset on the first day of the quarter for that quarter. Interest 
accrues and compounds at the end of each calendar month, with the interest 
accruing for any calendar year to be deferred and paid on or before the last 
business day of the second calendar year following the year in which the 
interest accrued; provided, however, that if the principal amount becomes due 
and payable, all accrued interest shall also be due and payable. During 2010, 
we used borrowings under our promissory note to Forest to fund leasehold 
acquisitions in our Narraway/Ojay fields and for other general working capital 
purposes. During 2011, we used borrowings under our promissory note to Forest 
to fund the acquisition of certain gas properties in our Narraway/Ojay fields 
and for other general working capital purposes."

common stock offered by us of approximately $171.0 million, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and the expenses of this offering payable by us 
(which will include those incurred by the selling stockholders, other than 
underwriting discounts on the shares offered by them). Only the selling 
stockholders will sell shares of common stock if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised, and we will not receive any proceeds 
from the shares of common stock to be offered by the selling stockholders 
in the over-allotment option. 

We will pay underwriting discounts on the shares offered by us and the 
expenses of this offering payable by us and the selling stockholders. 

We will retain net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by 
us in this offering equal to $150.0 million. The remaining net proceeds 
will be used for the following purposes and in the following amounts: 

• we will pay three individual, unaffiliated holders of our Subordinated 
Notes a fee equal to $450,000 in the aggregate; and 
 
• we will use the remaining net proceeds of this offering, which we 
estimate to be $20.6 million, to pay a portion of the outstanding principal 
amounts of the Tranche A Notes and Tranche B Notes and all accrued and 
unpaid interest thereon, to redeem a portion of the outstanding shares 
of Class B Preferred Stock and, to the extent funds are available, to 
redeem a portion of the outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock. 
Of such net proceeds, 35% will be used to pay principal and interest on 
certain of the Tranche B Notes owned by investment funds managed by 
Indigo and 65% will be used to pay principal and interest on certain 
of the Tranche A Notes and Tranche B Notes owned by investment funds 
managed by Oaktree, to redeem (at a redemption price per share equal 
to the Liquidation Preference) certain of the outstanding shares of 
Class B Preferred Stock owned by an unaffiliated individual stockholder

We intend to use the $150.0 million of net proceeds we retain from this 
offering to pay $1.8 million to Indigo in connection with the termination 
of their professional services agreement with us and the remaining proceeds 
for general corporate purposes, including cash reserves, working capital 
(including termination of our letter of credit facility described below), 
sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters, and 
capital expenditures, including future flight equipment acquisitions. 

We are party to a $30 million letter of credit facility that we use to 
satisfy a portion of the required holdback for our principal credit card 
processor. The facility is subject to a commitment fee of 15% per annum, 
which is payable on a monthly basis. As of March 31, 2011, the amount 
under the letter of credit was $13.0 million. We intend to terminate 
this letter of credit facility after the consummation of this offering 
and use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering retained by us 
to pay the lender a $0.6 million termination fee and to provide for any 
increase in restricted cash required by our credit card processor as a 
result of such termination. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high quality, 
short-term obligations, and do not intend to invest in auction rate 
securities. Currently we do not yet know the amounts that we intend to 
use for each of these general corporate activities. Accordingly, our 
management will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds 
in this offering. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will 
yield a favorable return."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $111.5 million, based on 
the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting the 
$11.8 million in underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses 
payable by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of 
shares by the selling stockholders or as a result of the exercise by the 
underwriters of the overallotment option to purchase 1,650,000 shares of 
common stock by certain selling stockholders. 

We plan to use our net proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding 
debt under our term loan facilities with various lenders and under our 
revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2011, we had $41.2 million 
outstanding under our various debt facilities. This amount consists of 
(i) $6.5 million in principal under our loan and security agreement with 
Square 1 Bank. The loan is scheduled to mature in October 2011 and the 
security agreement is scheduled to mature in July 2011, and both bear 
interest at an annual rate of 5.0%; (ii) $27.4 million in principal, 
including $3.2 million in accrued interest through March 31, 2011 on 
our loan and security agreements with Escalate Capital I, L.P. and Gold 
Hill Capital Venture Lending 03, L.P. The loans are scheduled to mature 
in May 2012 and bear interest at an annual rate of 12.0%; and (iii) $7.9 
million in principal and accrued interest consisting of (a) $2.1 million 
in principal on our loans under our agreement with Pinnacle Financial 
Partners. These loans are scheduled to mature in 2011 and 2012 and bear 
interest at an annual rate of 8.26%; (b) $0.2 million in principal on our 
loan agreement with Bank of Celina. The loan is scheduled to mature in 
October 2021 and bears interest at an annual rate of 3.5%; (c) $1.0 million 
in principal on our loan agreement with Automated License Systems. The loan 
is scheduled to mature in October 2012 and bears interest at an annual rate 
of 5.0%; (d) $3.0 million in principal and $0.5 million in accrued interest 
through March 2011 on our loan agreement with ABS Ventures. The loan is 
scheduled to mature in September 2011 and bears interest at an annual rate 
of 10.0%; and (e) $1.0 million in principal and $0.1 million in accrued 
interest through March 2011 on our loan agreement with David Alberga. The 
loan is scheduled to mature in September 2011 and bears interest at an 
annual rate of 10.0%. 

We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for funding potential 
acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, including financing our 
growth, developing additional application services functionality and 
features, acquiring new customers and funding capital expenditures. We 
have no commitments with respect to any future acquisitions. Other than 
the repayment of our debt facilities, we have not yet identified the amounts 
we plan to spend on each of these areas or the timing of the expenditures. 
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application 
of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our 
management regarding the application of the proceeds in this offering. The 
amounts that we actually spend for the purposes described above may vary 
significantly and will depend, in part, on the timing and amount of our 
future revenue, our future expenses and any future acquisitions that we 
may propose. Pending these uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade securities. We 
cannot predict whether the proceeds will yield a favorable return. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for 
our common stock, to facilitate our future access to the public equity 
markets and to obtain additional capital."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering
    out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the
    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any
    such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering, or approximately $6,125,000
    in the aggregate, until completion of our initial business combination. If
    the aggregate gross proceeds to us from this offering (including pursuant
    to the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option) exceed
    $200,000,000, the aggregate underwriting commissions will be increased to
    6.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering, with 4.0% being deferred and
    placed into the trust account. The deferred commissions will be released
    to the underwriters only on completion of an initial business combination,
    as described in this prospectus. The remaining funds in the trust account
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial
    business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including
    repayment of any loans made by our sponsor or affiliates of our sponsor,
    payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection
    with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other
    companies or for working capital.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our
    current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated
    expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates
    for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for our
    expenses. The amount of interest available to us from the trust account
    may be less than $1,750,000 as a result of the current interest rate
    environment.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

A total of approximately $175,000,000 (or approximately $200,725,000 if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds 
from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in this
prospectus, including approximately $6,125,000 (or approximately $8,050,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred 
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account located in the 
United States at Citibank, N.A. with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 
LLC acting as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury 
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting 
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Our 
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, except for 
a portion of the interest income that may be released to us to pay any income
and franchise taxes and to fund our working capital requirements, as discussed 
below, and any amounts necessary to purchase up to 50% of our public shares 
if we seek stockholder approval of our business combination, none of the
funds held in the trust account will be released until the earlier of (i) the 
completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% 
of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination 
within 21 months from the closing of this offering (subject to the 
requirements of law).

We may increase the initial amount held in the trust account from 
approximately $10.00 per unit prior to the effectiveness of the registration 
statement of which this prospectus forms a part. In such case, the increase 
would be funded by an increase in the amount of the deferral of the 
underwriting commissions payable in connection with this offering, an increase
in the number of sponsor warrants to be purchased by our sponsor at a price 
of $0.75 per warrant and/or a reduction from $1,000,000 of the amount 
initially available to us for working capital that is not held in the trust 
account. Public stockholders would own a smaller percentage of our outstanding
common stock on a fully diluted basis to the extent that our sponsor purchases
additional warrants. We do not intend to reduce the initial amount to be held 
in the trust account.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to 
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete 
a business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account 
that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, 
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
completing the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income of 
up to $1,750,000, subject to proportionate adjustment in the event the size 
of the offering changes as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of any 
portion of the over-allotment option or we otherwise decided to make such 
a change prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which 
this prospectus forms a part, earned on the trust account balance (net of 
franchise and income taxes payable) that may be released to fund our working
capital requirements will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to 
which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that 
while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth 
due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business 
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth
due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual 
amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to use from 
the trust account is less than $1,750,000 as a result of the current interest
rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, 
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. As described 
elsewhere in this prospectus, the amounts in the trust account may be invested
only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or
in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the 
Investment Company Act. If, for example, the amounts in the trust account 
were invested for a 21-month period in U.S. government treasury bills with 
180-day maturities yielding 0.18% per annum, they would generate a total of 
approximately $552,125 in pre-tax interest (or approximately $636,125 in
pre-tax interest if the over-allotment option is exercised in full). If the
actual yields are higher, a greater amount of pre-tax interest would be 
generated. Conversely, if the actual yields are lower, or if (as we expect) 
interest generated by the amounts in the trust account is withdrawn from time 
to time, a lesser amount of pre-tax interest would be generated. If we are 
required to seek additional capital, we could seek such additional capital 
through loans or additional investments from members of our management team,
but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to 
advance funds to, or invest in, us. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option or the size of this offering is increased, the maximum 
amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust account will 
proportionately increase (for example, if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option is exercised in full, the size of the offering will increase by 15%, 
and the maximum amount of interest income we may withdraw from the trust 
account will increase to $2,012,500). In addition, if the size of this 
offering is decreased, the maximum amount of interest income we may withdraw 
from the trust account will proportionately decrease. We will use any 
proportionate increase in interest income to cover our working capital 
expenses. While we currently do not know what our future working capital
expenses will be and while they will not necessarily be proportionate to the 
size of the offering, we believe that any additional interest income released
to us would facilitate our ability to finance the exploration and 
consideration of a greater number of potential acquisition targets.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the Nasdaq, we 
have agreed to pay Roscomare Ltd., an entity owned and controlled by Mr. 
Sloan, our chairman and chief executive officer, a total of $10,000 per month 
for office space, administrative services and secretarial support. This 
arrangement is being agreed to by Mr. Sloan for our benefit and is not 
intended to provide Mr. Sloan compensation in lieu of salary or other 
remuneration. In addition, we will pay Mr. Graf, or an entity owned and 
controlled by him, a monthly consulting fee of $15,000 for services prior
to the completion of our initial business combination. We believe that such 
fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated 
person. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our 
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up 
to $200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These 
loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of 
August 1, 2011 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon 
the closing of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that 
has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the 
trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out
of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that the initial
business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working 
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. 
Up to $500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post 
business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option 
of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the sponsor warrants. The 
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been 
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

Unlike many blank check companies, if we seek stockholder approval of our 
initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection 
with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, prior to 
the completion of a business combination, our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation will permit the release to us from the trust account of
amounts necessary to purchase up to 50% of the shares sold in this offering 
(8,750,000 shares, or 10,062,500 shares if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full) at any time commencing after the filing of a preliminary 
proxy statement for our initial business combination and ending on the date 
of the stockholder meeting to approve the initial business combination. 
Purchases will be made only in open market transactions at times when we are 
not in possession of any material non-public information and may not be made
during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. It is 
intended that these purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange 
Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, 
including with respect to the manner of sale (sales are required to be 
effected through one broker on a single day, subject to certain exceptions), 
timing (purchases are subject to certain restrictions at the beginning and 
end of the trading session), pricing (the purchase price may not exceed the 
highest independent bid or the last independent transaction price, whichever 
is higher) and volume of purchases (the total volume of Rule 10b-18 purchases 
effected by us or any affiliated purchasers effected on any single day 
generally must not exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume of the 
shares). If the conditions of Rule 10b-18, as in effect at the time we wish 
to make such purchases, are not satisfied, we may still make such purchases 
provided such purchases do not violate the anti-manipulation provisions of 
9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act or Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 
Any purchases we make will be at prices (inclusive of commissions) not to 
exceed the per-share amount then held in the trust account (approximately 
$10.00 per share or approximately $9.97 per share if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full). Any difference between the 
prices we pay and the per-share amount then held in the trust account will 
remain in the trust account and will be available for distribution to our 
remaining public stockholders upon any subsequent redemption of our public 
shares. We can purchase any or all of the 8,750,000 shares (or 10,062,500 
shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) we 
are entitled to purchase. It will be entirely in our discretion as to how 
many shares are purchased. Purchasing decisions will be made based on various 
factors, including the then current market price of our common stock and the 
terms of the proposed business combination. All shares purchased by us will 
be immediately cancelled. Such open market purchases, if any, would be 
conducted by us to minimize any disparity between the then current market 
price of our common stock and the per-share amount held in the trust account.
A market price below the per-share trust amount could provide an incentive 
for purchasers to buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary proxy 
statement at a discount to the per-share amount held in the trust account 
for the sole purpose of voting against our initial business combination and 
exercising redemption rights for the full per share amount held in the trust 
account. Such trading activity could enable such investors to block a business
combination by making it difficult for us to obtain the approval of such 
business combination by the vote of a majority of our outstanding shares of 
common stock.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant 
to the tender offer rules, we may enter into privately negotiated transactions
to purchase public shares from stockholders following completion of the initial
business combination with proceeds released to us from the trust account 
immediately following completion of the initial business combination. Our 
sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may also purchase 
shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the
completion of our initial business combination. However, neither we, nor our 
sponsor, directors or officers have any current commitments, plans or 
intentions to engage in such transactions or formulated any terms or 
conditions for any such transactions. If either we or they engage in such 
transactions, neither we nor they will make any such purchases when we or 
they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed 
to the seller. Although we do not currently anticipate paying any premium
purchase price for such public shares, in the event we do, the payment of 
a premium may not be in the best interest of those stockholders not receiving
any such additional consideration. In addition, the payment of a premium by 
us after the completion of our initial business combination may not be in the 
best interest of the remaining stockholders who do not redeem their shares. 
Such stockholders will experience a reduction in book value per share compared 
to the value received by stockholders that have their shares purchased by us 
at a premium. Nevertheless, because any payment of a premium by us will be 
made only from proceeds released to us from the trust account following 
completion of a business combination, no such payments will reduce the per 
share amounts available in the trust account for redemptions in connection 
with the business combination. Except for the limitations described above on 
use of trust proceeds released to us prior to completing our initial business
combination, there is no limit on the amount of shares that could be acquired 
by us or our affiliates, or the price we or they may pay, if we hold 
a stockholder vote. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if 
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under 
the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private 
rules under the Exchange Act; however, if we determine at the time of any such
purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, we will comply with 
such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net 
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may 
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain 
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption 
rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any 
net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of 
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an 
alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations 
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable 
to complete an initial business combination within 21 months following the 
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described 
herein. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or 
interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with 
respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the
completion of a business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders 
have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder 
shares if we fail to complete a business combination within 21 months from the 
closing of this offering, (subject to the requirements of law). However, if
 our initial stockholders, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates 
acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
 redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete 
a business combination within the required time period."

approximately US$113.6 million, or approximately US$133.2 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, in 
each case after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the 
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following 
purposes:

• US$50.0 million for content acquisition and production;

• US$35.0 million for product development and technology infrastructure; and

• US$25.0 million for marketing and sales. 

We intend to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds we receive from 
this offering for other general corporate purposes, including potential 
facilities upgrade, and for potential acquisitions although we are not 
currently negotiating any acquisition transactions.

The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and allocate the net 
proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business 
conditions. Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and 
discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event 
occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering
differently than as described in this prospectus.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand 
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, as an offshore holding company,
we are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our 
PRC operating subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to 
our affiliated consolidated entities only through loans. Subject to the 
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, 
we may extend loans to our operating subsidiary and affiliated consolidated 
entities in China or make additional capital contributions to our operating 
subsidiary in China to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. 
For an increase of registered capital of our PRC subsidiary, we need to 
receive approval from the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC or its local 
counterparts, who will decide within 90 days after receiving the application 
documents. If we provide funding to our PRC subsidiary through loans, the 
total amount of such loans may not exceed the difference between its total 
investment as approved by the foreign investment authorities and its 
registered capital. Such loans should be registered with the SAFE which 
usually takes no more than 20 working days to complete. The cost of obtaining 
such approvals or completing such registration is minimal. If we are not able 
to receive such approvals in a timely basis or at all, we may consider 
adopting legally permissible alternatives, including we and our PRC subsidiary
entering into transactions by which our PRC subsidiary borrows RMB loans from 
a financial institution in China and we or any of our offshore entities 
providing corporate guarantees to an offshore affiliate of such financial 
institution in connection with the borrowing of such a loan by our PRC 
subsidiary.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government 
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

common units offered by this prospectus of approximately $65.3 million after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, a structuring fee and 
offering expenses (or approximately $75.5 million if the underwriters exercise 
their option to purchase additional common units from us in full). We intend 
to use the net proceeds, including the net proceeds from the issuance and 
sale of any of the first 350,000 common units pursuant to an exercise of the 
underwriters' option to purchase additional common units from us, to repay 
amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility (approximately $65.0 
million) and, to the extent that net proceeds remain after all amounts 
outstanding under our revolving credit facility are repaid, for working 
capital and general partnership purposes, which may include the acquisition 
of propane and midstream related businesses. There are no agreements, 
understandings or commitments with respect to any such acquisition at this 
time. 

Our $200.0 million revolving credit facility, as amended through April 2011, 
matures on October 10, 2014 and consists of a $50.0 million working capital 
facility and a $150.0 million acquisition facility. As of March 31, 2011, we 
had $65.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, with no 
amounts outstanding under our working capital facility and $65.0 million 
outstanding under our acquisition facility. As of March 31, 2011, the 
amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility have a weighted 
average interest rate of 3.96%. Substantially all of the amounts outstanding 
under our acquisition facility are remaining from the $81.5 million we 
borrowed at the closing of our formation transactions to (i) make cash 
distributions to NGL Supply and Hicks LLC (approximately $41.6 million), 
(ii) repay assumed indebtedness of NGL Supply and Hicks LLC (approximately 
$34.4 million), (iii) pay a portion of the purchase price for Gifford ($5.0 
million) and (iv) pay related transactions costs (approximately $0.5 
million). 

We intend to use the net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of 
their option to purchase additional common units from us as follows: (i) the 
net proceeds from the issuance and sale of any of the first 350,000 common 
units (approximately $6.8 million) will be used with the other net proceeds 
of this offering as described above after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions and a structuring fee and (ii) the net proceeds from the 
issuance and sale of any of the remaining 175,000 common units (approximately 
$3.4 million) will be used to redeem from the NGL Energy LP Investor Group 
on a pro rata basis a number of common units equal to the number of common 
units issued upon exercise of that portion of the option at a price per
common unit equal to the proceeds per common unit before expenses but after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and a structuring fee. We 
will cancel the common units redeemed from the NGL Energy LP Investor Group 
so that they will no longer be outstanding. Members of the NGL Energy LP 
Investor Group will be deemed to be underwriters with respect to any common 
units so redeemed. 

The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and 
perform services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business. 
Affiliates of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, SunTrust

shares in this offering will be approximately $456.0 million, or $525.6 million 
if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, after 
deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses 
payable by us. We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to our 
operating partnership in exchange for OP units.

We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering to
repay approximately $443.2 million of secured indebtedness and to pay 
approximately $10.3 million in associated transfer and assumption costs and 
prepayment penalties. In addition, we intend to use approximately $2.5 million
to pay franchisor related fees.

If the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, we expect to 
use the additional net proceeds to us, which will be approximately $69.6 
million in the aggregate, for general business and working capital purposes, 
including potential future acquisitions.

Pending the permanent use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing, short-term investment-grade 
securities, money-market accounts or other investments that are consistent 
with our intention to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT.


The following table sets forth information, as of December 31, 2010, with 
respect to the indebtedness that we intend to repay with the net proceeds of 
this offering and approximately $33.6 million of cash on hand:

net proceeds from the sale of the 5,000,000 shares of our common stock in 
this offering will be $44.9 million, or $51.8 million if the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full. “Net proceeds” 
is what we expect to receive after paying the underwriters’ discounts and 
commissions and other expenses of the offering. 

Assuming the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option, we 
have assumed gross offering proceeds of $50.0 million, less underwriting fees 
and commissions of approximately 7.25% of the gross proceeds, or $3.6 million, 
and other offering expenses incurred since our new financing of $1.5 million, 
resulting in $44.9 million of net proceeds. We intend to use such net proceeds 
to repay $39.0 million in principal amount of our New First Lien Notes and 
$1.8 million Cash Pay Second Lien Notes at a redemption price of 110%. As of 
May 9, 2011, Mr. Bell, our Chief Executive Officer, President and a director, 
and Mr. Staton, our Chairman of the Board and Treasurer, beneficially own 
$3.6 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of the New First Lien Notes 
and $6.6 million and $6.6 million, respectively, of the Cash Pay Second Lien 
Notes. After giving effect to this offering and application of the proceeds 
from this offering to repay a portion of our New First Lien Notes and our
Cash Pay Second Lien Notes, based upon an initial offering price of $10.00 
per share of common stock. Messrs. Bell and Staton will beneficially own $3.1
million and $3.1 million, respectively, of our New First Lien Notes and $5.7 
million and $5.7 million, respectively, of our Cash Pay Second Lien Notes. 
Pursuant to the indentures governing the New First Lien Notes and Cash Pay 
Second Lien Notes, $17.2 million will be payable to our affiliates, including 
$3.0 million to affiliates of Messrs. Bell and Staton. 

As of December 31, 2010, we had $305.0 million of New First Lien Notes and 
$13.8 million of Cash Pay Second Lien Notes outstanding. The New First Lien 
Notes and Cash Pay Second Lien Notes have a stated maturity date of September 
30, 2013. Interest on the New First Lien Notes and Cash Pay Second Lien Notes 
accrues at a rate per annum equal to 14%. As of December 31, 2010, there was 
no accrued and unpaid interest on the New First Lien Notes and Cash Pay 
Second Lien Notes. 

The underwriters’ over-allotment option, if exercised in full, provides for 
the issuance of up to 750,000 additional shares of our common stock, for 
additional net proceeds of $7.0 million, based upon an initial offering 
price of $10.00 per share of common stock. Any proceeds obtained upon 
exercise of the over-allotment option will be used to repay debt, as 
described above."

approximately US$65.7 million, after deducting the estimated underwriting 
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering
as follows:

• approximately US$4.0 million to pay accrued but unpaid dividends due to the
  holders of our Series A preferred shares payable upon the completion of
  this offering, including US$3.0 million to Fame Gain, Qiming Venture
  Partners, L.P. and Qiming Managing Directors Fund, L.P.; and

• the remaining amount for general corporate purposes, including capital
  expenditures, such as in connection with establishing new offices, 
  expanding our services and purchasing additional hardware for expanded
   capacity and to meet new demand from new services, and funding possible
  future strategic acquisitions. 

We have no current plans, proposals or arrangements for any material 
acquisitions.

Fame Gain is 100% owned by our chairman, Mr. Yongqiang Qian. The general 
partner of Qiming Venture Partners, L.P. is Qiming GP, L.P. and one of our 
directors, Mr. JP Gan, is a managing director of the general partner of both 
Qiming GP, L.P. and Qiming Managing Directors Fund, L.P.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and 
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans
and business condition, but our management will have significant flexibility 
and discretion in applying the net proceeds we receive from this offering. 
The occurrence of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result 
in application of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as 
described in this prospectus.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in 
investment-grade short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments or bank 
deposits.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling 
shareholders."

in this offering will be approximately $552.9 million after deducting 
estimated offering expenses payable by us of $5.5 million and underwriting 
discounts and commissions. If the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $636.6 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, available cash and
borrowings under our commercial debt facility to fund our capital expenditures,
and in particular our exploration and appraisal drilling program and 
development activities through 2013, our related operating expenses, to make 
a $15.0 million payment to GNPC upon the successful completion of this 
offering pursuant to the settlement agreement we entered into with GNPC to 
resolve our past disputes, and for general corporate purposes. Management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from 
this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend 
to invest the net proceeds in interest bearing, investment-grade securities.

We estimate we will incur approximately $500.0 million of capital expenditures
for the year ending December 31, 2011. This capital expenditure budget consists
of:

• $175.0 million for development in Ghana;

• $225.0 million for exploration and appraisal in Ghana;

• $30.0 million for exploration and appraisal in Cameroon;

• $30.0 million for new ventures to expand our license portfolio (including
  geological and geophysical expenses); and

• $40.0 million in unallocated funds which are available for additional
  drilling and licensing costs and activities. 

The ultimate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based 
on market conditions and the success of our drilling results. Our future 
financial condition and liquidity will be impacted by, among other factors, 
our level of production of oil and natural gas and the prices we receive from 
the sale thereof, the success of our exploration and appraisal drilling 
program, the number of commercially viable oil and natural gas discoveries 
made and the quantities of oil and natural gas discovered, the speed with 
which we can bring such discoveries to production, and the actual cost of 
exploration, appraisal and development of our oil and natural gas assets."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee,
    the FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have
    been paid from the funds we received from UBPS Services, LLC described
    below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
    available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of
    the insider warrants.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $250,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income
    earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us
    to pay for our tax obligations and our working capital requirements. We
    anticipate having approximately $350,000 (after payment of taxes owed on
    such interest income) available to us (based on interest on instruments
    held in trust at current market rates). We anticipate funding the balance
    of our expenses by entering into contingent fee arrangements with our
    vendors and/or additional shareholder loans. For purposes of presentation,
    the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net
    proceeds we expect to be available to us immediately following the
    offering.

(4) Of the net proceeds not held in trust, $125,000 will be used to repay the
    funds advanced to us from UBPS Services, LLC described below. 

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our initial 
stockholders have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an 
aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.1 million) from us, and the 
representative has committed to purchase the EBC warrants (for an aggregate 
purchase price of $360,000) from us. These purchases will take place on 
a private placement basis concurrently with the consummation of this offering.
We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of 
the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from the sale of these 
warrants will be placed in the trust account described below.

Of the net proceeds of this offering, approximately $72.7 million 
(approximately $83.2 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) including the approximately $3.5 million we will receive 
from the sale of the insider warrants and EBC warrants, will be placed in a 
trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. established and maintained by 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds held in 
trust will be invested, initially through Morgan Stanley, only in United 
States treasuries having a maturity of 180 days or less, so that we are not 
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except 
with respect to any interest income that may be released to us (1) that we 
may need to pay our income or other tax obligations and (2) any remaining 
interest that we need for working capital requirements, the proceeds will 
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of (A) the completion 
of a business combination and (B) the liquidation of the trust account if we 
have not completed a business combination within the required time period. In 
addition, there can be released to us from the trust account amounts necessary 
to purchase up to an average of $1.9 million worth of shares each month up to 
an aggregate amount of 50% of the shares sold in this offering (6,000,000 
shares, or 6,900,000 shares if the over-allotment option is exercised in 
full). Such purchases will commence 61 days after the date of this prospectus 
and end on the date on which we announce the execution of a definitive 
agreement for an initial business combination. Any such purchases will be 
made only in open market transactions pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan that we 
intend to enter immediately prior to the date of this prospectus with an 
independent broker-dealer approved by our board. This 10b5-1 plan will 
require us to purchase our shares at a price per share not to exceed the 
market price at any time when the market price falls below $5.75 per share. 
This 10b5-1 plan will remain in place until the maximum number of shares 
has been purchased under such plan or it expires by its own terms. It is 
intended that purchases will comply with the technical requirements of 
Rule 10b-18 (including timing, pricing and volume of purchases) under the 
Exchange Act (although the purchases may not actually be effected under 
Rule 10b-18, including as a result of an independent broker-dealer 
effectuating purchases under the 10b5-1 plan). All shares purchased by us 
will be cancelled. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as 
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete 
a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers 
of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target 
business. 

In addition, we have agreed to pay EarlyBirdCapital a fee equal to $2,070,000 
upon consummation of a business combination for acting as our investment 
banker on a non-exclusive basis to assist us in structuring and negotiating 
a business combination (but not for purposes of identifying a target 
business).

We have agreed to pay to UBPS Services, LLC a total of $7,500 per month for 
office space, administrative services and secretarial support from the date 
of this prospectus through the earlier of the consummation of a business 
combination or the liquidation of the trust account. This arrangement was
agreed to by UBPS Services, LLC for our benefit and is not intended to 
provide UBPS Services, LLC compensation in lieu of a management fee or 
other remuneration because it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid 
by UBPS Services, LLC will approximate the monthly reimbursement amount. We 
believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained 
from an unaffiliated person. Upon the consummation of a business combination 
or the liquidation of the trust account if we have not completed a business 
combination within the required time period, we will cease paying these 
monthly fees.

Other than this $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including 
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our 
existing officers, directors, initial stockholders or any of their 
affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, 
the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of 
transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement 
of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with undertaking 
certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating 
possible target businesses and business combinations. Reimbursement for such 
expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and is 
currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and other third-party expenses 
attendant to the search for target businesses and to the due diligence 
investigation, structuring and negotiation of a business combination,” 
“Due diligence of prospective target businesses by our officers, directors 
and initial stockholders” and “Working capital to cover miscellaneous 
expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation obligations 
and reserves.” Since the role of present management after a business 
combination is uncertain, we cannot predict what remuneration, if any, will 
be paid to those persons after the consummation of a business combination.

Regardless of whether the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised 
in full, the net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust 
for our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination 
will be approximately $250,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds 
held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest 
income) may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in 
searching for a business combination. We intend to use the excess working 
capital available for miscellaneous expenses for director and officer 
liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in 
the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring 
and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for 
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial 
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below.
We will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. 
We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses 
and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the funds not being placed 
in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target 
business or as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision 
in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” 
around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to 
such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business 
combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If 
we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down 
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the 
terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available 
funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our 
breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to 
continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, 
potential target businesses.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust 
account, along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these 
funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may 
reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, 
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business 
and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the fee equal to 
$2,070,000 payable to EarlyBirdCapital upon consummation of the business 
combination for acting as our investment banker on a non-exclusive basis to 
assist us in structuring and negotiating a business combination (but not for 
purposes of identifying a target business). To the extent that our capital 
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business 
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to 
consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company 
and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working 
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working 
capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or 
expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for
marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds 
could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we 
had incurred prior to the completion of our business combination if the funds
available to us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such 
expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay 
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust 
account. If such funds are insufficient, Mr. Shah has agreed to advance us 
the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be
no more than approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of 
such expenses. 

On December 6, 2010, UBPS Services, LLC loaned to us an aggregate of $125,000 
which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced 
in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee and 
a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan is payable 
without interest on the earlier of December 6, 2011 and the consummation of 
this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering 
available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business 
combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust 
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust 
account) only in the event of the liquidation of the trust account, if that 
public stockholder redeems such shares for cash in connection with a business 
combination which we consummate or if that public stockholder sells his, her 
or its shares to us as described elsewhere in this prospectus. In no other 
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any 
kind to or in the trust account."

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing 
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but
will result in a reduction of Farmington Bank's deposits. The net proceeds may 
vary because total expenses relating to the offering may be more or less than 
our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a syndicated 
community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not purchased in 
the subscription and community offerings. 
  
FCB May Use the Proceeds it Retains From the Offering: 
  
 #  to invest in securities;  

 #  to deposit funds in Farmington Bank;  

 #  to repay short term borrowings;  

 #  to contribute additional capital to Farmington Bank;  

 #  to finance strategic growth opportunities, such as acquisitions of other 
    banking institutions or financial services related businesses, although we
    do not currently have any agreements or understandings regarding any 
    specific acquisition opportunities;  

 #  to pay cash dividends to stockholders;  

 #  to fund stock based compensation plans;  

 #  to repurchase shares of our common stock; and  

 #  for other general corporate purposes.  

FCB expects to contribute 50.0% of the net offering proceeds to Farmington Bank
for working capital to be used by Farmington Bank and 8.5% of the net offering 
proceeds to fund a loan to Farmington Bank's employee stock ownership plan to 
purchase up to 8.0% of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding after 
the offering (between $9.2 million and $12.4 million, or $14.3 million if the 
offering is increased by 15.0%). The remaining 41.5% of the net offering 
proceeds will be retained by FCB. Initially, FCB intends to invest the proceeds
retained in the offering by FCB in short-term liquid investments, such as U.S. 
treasury and government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and cash 
and cash equivalents, or deposit the funds in Farmington Bank. Pursuant to 
Connecticut banking regulations, FCB may not repurchase shares of our common 
stock during the first year following the completion of the conversion and the 
offering, except under limited circumstances, such as to fund tax-qualified 
employee stock benefit plans or management recognition plans that have been 
approved by stockholders. 
  
Farmington Bank May Use the Net Proceeds it Receives From the Offering: 
  
 #  to grow its balance sheet through loan origination and deposit generation;

 #  to enhance existing products and services and support the development of 
    new products and services;  

 #  to expand its banking franchise through de novo branching; and  

 #  for other general corporate purposes.  

The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on changes in interest 
rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial services 
industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the 
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall 
market conditions."

securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, securities issued and guaranteed by 
Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, short-term funds, as well as cash equivalents for 
temporary cash management until we identify and consummate one or more 
transactions that are consistent with our investment objective. These 
investments are expected to provide a lower rate of return than we will seek 
from the implementation of our investment strategies. Prior to the time we have
fully invested the net proceeds of this offering and our concurrent private 
placement, we may fund quarterly distributions out of such net proceeds. 

We also intend to use a portion of net proceeds to invest in a portfolio of 
RMBS and other assets, such as CMBS, as part of our plan to qualify as a REIT, 
while satisfying the requirements for exemption from registration under the 
Investment Company Act. In this regard, we may also acquire RMBS that represent
the entire beneficial interest in the underlying pool of mortgage loans. We may
incur leverage in connection with the acquisition of any of these assets

services, technologies or other businesses. The amount and timing of these 
expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors, including competitive 
and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business.

Pending their use, we plan to invest our net proceeds from this offering in 
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering to us, and investors will be relying on the 
judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds."

 (1)  A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, 
      the FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees have been 
      paid from the funds we received from Eric S. Rosenfeld described below. 
      These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available
      to us.  

 (2)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of
      the insider warrants or EBC warrants.  

 (3)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust will equal $400,000, or $475,000
      if the over-allotment is exercised in full (or a pro rata amount above 
      $400,000 if only a portion of the over-allotment option is exercised). In
      addition, interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account
      (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) will be available 
      to us to pay for our working capital requirements. We estimate the 
      interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $500,000 in 
      total for a 24-month period assuming an interest rate of approximately 
      0.5% per year. However, if interest rates are less than 0.5% per year, 
      the amount of interest we will have access to will be reduced.  

 (4)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of 
      these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
      we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
      estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
      business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business 
      combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of 
      proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
      allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
      estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from 
      our excess working capital.  

The initial stockholders and EarlyBirdCapital have committed to purchase the 
insider warrants and EBC warrants, respectively, from us on a private placement
basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering, for an aggregate 
purchase price of $3,550,000. All of the proceeds we receive from these 
purchases will be placed in the trust account described below. 

$60,600,000, or $69,210,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, 
of net proceeds of this offering, including the $3,550,000 we will receive from
the sale of the insider warrants and EBC warrants, will be placed in a trust 
account at UBS Financial Services Inc., maintained by Continental Stock 
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in 
trust will be invested only in United States treasuries having a maturity of 
180 days or less, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under 
the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) amounts necessary to 
repurchase up to 25% of the shares sold in this offering, (ii) interest earned 
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our 
income or other tax obligations and (iii) interest earned on the funds held in 
the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital 
requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until 
the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our redemption of 
100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business 
combination in the required time periods. The proceeds held in the trust 
account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business 
with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as 
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance 
operations of the target business. 

The payment to Crescendo Advisors II, an affiliate of Eric S. Rosenfeld, our 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for 
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and 
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Crescendo Advisors 
II for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Rosenfeld compensation 
in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services 
in New York, that the fee charged by Crescendo Advisors II is at least as 
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This 
arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or the 
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the 
$10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s, 
consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers,
directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any 
services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business 
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such 
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred 
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying 
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable 
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from 
the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to 
examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us 
out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to “Legal, 
accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the search for target 
businesses and to the due diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation 
of a business combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses by
our officers, directors and initial stockholders” and “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation 
obligations and reserves.” Since the role of present management after a 
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination. 

The net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our 
working capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be 
approximately $400,000, or $475,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised 
in full (or a pro rata amount above $400,000 if only a portion of the over-
allotment option is exercised). In addition, interest earned on the funds held 
in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may 
be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for a
business combination. We intend to use the after-tax interest earned for 
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance 
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, 
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business 
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by our initial stockholders, officers and directors 
in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. 

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust 
account, along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these 
funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may 
reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories. 

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, 
including some of the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target 
business and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including a fee equal to 
$2,415,000 to EarlyBirdCapital upon consummation of the business combination 
for acting as our investment banker on a non-exclusive basis to assist us in 
structuring and negotiating a business combination (but not for purposes of 
identifying a target business). To the extent that our share capital is used 
in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the 
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business 
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any 
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the 
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in 
a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ 
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and 
development of existing or new products. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination and are forced
to subsequently liquidate, we will pay the costs of such liquidation from our 
remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, 
Eric S. Rosenfeld has agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such
liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) 
and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. 

As of the date of this prospectus, Eric S. Rosenfeld has advanced to us an 
aggregate of $100,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this 
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA 
filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan is 
payable without interest on the earlier of (i) February 25, 2012, (ii) the 
consummation of this offering or (iii) the date on which we determine not to 
proceed with our initial public offering. The loan will be repaid out of the 
proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the 
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business 
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in 
order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this 
offering, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates 
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. 
The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business 
combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s discretion, up to $500,000 
of the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant. 
The warrants would be identical to the insider warrants. If we do not complete 
a business combination, the loans will be forgiven. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to 
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our 
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed 
a business combination in the required time periods, (ii) if that public 
stockholder sells to us such shares prior to or at the closing of our initial 
business combination or (iii) if that public stockholder converts such shares 
in connection with a business combination which we consummate. In no other 
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind 
to or in the trust account."

We intend to use the net proceeds to redeem $417.6 million of the accreted 
value of our 10.375% Senior Discount Notes due 2016 including the 5% 
redemption premium thereof. We used the net proceeds from the offering of 
our 10.375% Senior Discount Notes to pay a dividend to our existing equity
holders. Approximately $71.4 million accreted value as of June 30, 2011

additional shares in full, the net proceeds to us will be approximately 
$165.3 million. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of 
shares by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use approximately $117.3 million of the net proceeds to 
effect the Notes Redemption (in which a portion of the Company’s outstanding
$300.0 million principal amount of 11 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 
2015, or notes issued in exchange therefor in the Exchange Offer, would 
be redeemed pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing such notes). 
The proceeds of the 11 3/4 % Senior Secured Notes due 2015 were used to 
partially finance the 2010 Acquisitions, to pay related fees and expenses, 
and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we intend to use 
approximately $37.8 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay 
fees pursuant to the Material Event Investment Advisory Agreement and 
related arrangements and the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
The $37.8 million in fees described above is equal to 3% of the equity value of 
the Company immediately prior to this offering based on the public offering 
price, excluding equity for which Class B Common Stock of Holdings is exchanged 
in the Recapitalization and the Merger."

 (1)  Includes amounts payable to public stockholders holding up to 5,520,000
 of the shares sold in this offering (or 6,348,000 shares if the underwriters’
 over-allotment option is exercised in full) who properly redeem their shares
 in connection with the consummation of our initial business transaction.
 Assuming a per share redemption price of $10.20 per share (or approximately
 $10.15 per share stock if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
 exercised in full), $56,304,000 of the proceeds of this offering (or
 approximately $64,418,400 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
 exercised in full) would be payable to such stockholders.  

 (2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been funded with the proceeds
 of promissory notes totaling  $100,862, outstanding as of March 3, 2011,
 from one of our officers. These notes will be repaid out of the proceeds of
 this offering upon the consummation of this offering.  

 (3)  The underwriting discount of 2.0% is payable at the closing of the
 offering and the deferred corporate finance fee of 1.5% is payable upon
 consummation of our business transaction and will be held in the trust
 account until consummation of such business transaction.  

 (4)  The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will
 remain constant at $1,000,000 even if the over-allotment option is
 exercised. In addition, there can be released to us from the trust account,
 interest earned on the funds in the trust account (i) to fund our expenses
 related to investigating and selecting a target business, negotiating an
 acquisition agreement and consummating such acquisition and our other
 working capital requirements and (ii) to pay any amounts we may need to pay
 our income or other tax obligations. We anticipate that approximately
 $82,000 (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) will be
 available to us, from interest income to be earned on the funds held in the
 trust account. The estimated interest earned on funds held in the trust
 account is based on what believe to be a conservative interest rate of
 0.15% per annum following this offering generated from the funds which will 
 be invested in United States “government securities,” defined as any 
 Treasury Bills issued by the United States having a maturity of 180 days or
 less. During the six month period ended February 28, 2011, U.S. Treasury
 Bills with six month maturities were yielding approximately 0.18% per annum.
 The 0.15% assumed interest rate has been applied for the purpose of the above
 calculation because we believe it represents a conservative estimate
 calculated based on the above described yields. While we cannot assure you
 the balance of the trust account will be invested to yield these rates, we
 believe such rates are representative of those we may receive on the
 balance of the trust account. For purposes of presentation, the full amount
 available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us
 immediately following the offering.  

 (5)  The legal and accounting fees relating to SEC reporting obligations and
 administrative services and management fee payable to our sponsor may differ
 as a result of us consummating a business transaction prior to the 15 (or 18)
 month deadline (as figures in the table assume payment for these line items
 through the end of the 15 (or 18) month period.) In the event we incur less
 expenses as a result of consummating the business combination prior to the
 end of the 15 (or 18) month period, we may use amounts allotted for such
 expenses to pay additional legal and accounting expenses that we incur in
 connection with conducting due diligence, negotiating and structuring 
 a business transaction based upon the level of complexity of such business
 transaction. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
 other than fluctuations among these categories of allocated expenses. These
 expenditures assume a 0.15% interest per annum based upon current yield of
 securities in which the trust account may be invested; however, we cannot
 provide assurance regarding this amount. To the extent the prevailing
 interest rate is different than our assumption, our actual expenditures will
 differ from these estimates.  

 (6)  We have agreed to pay our sponsor, which is controlled by certain of
 our officers and directors, or an affiliate of our sponsor, $5,000 per-month
 for office space as well as for certain services, including general and
 administrative services such as receptionist, secretarial and general office
 services. We have also agreed to pay our sponsor a management fee of $10,000
 per month which will be used by our sponsor to pay our President, Keith
 Oster, for services. This agreement commences on the date of this prospectus
 and shall continue until the earliest to occur of: (i) the consummation of
 a business transaction or (ii) 18 months from the date of this prospectus if
 the 15 month period is extended as a result of us entering into a letter of
 intent or definitive agreement within the 15 month period.  

Of the net proceeds of this offering, an aggregate of $61,200,000 (or 
$70,020,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) 
will be deposited into the trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. This 
amount includes a portion of the $3,900,000 of proceeds from the private 
placement in which our sponsor will purchase 390,000 placement units. None 
of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other 
than any interest earned on the funds in the trust account that we need to 
pay our income or other tax obligations and any remaining interest that we 
need for our working capital requirements, until the earlier of (i) the 
consummation of a business transaction, (ii) our redemption of the public 
shares sold in this offering if we are unable to consummate a business 
transaction within 15 months from the date hereof (subject to a three month 
extension) (subject to the requirements of law) or (iii) our liquidation 
(if no redemption occurs). The proceeds held in the trust account (net of 
taxes and amounts released to us for working capital purposes but exclusive 
of the deferred corporate finance fee payable or used to pay public 
stockholders who have exercised their redemption rights) may be used as 
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
ultimately complete a business transaction or, if there are insufficient 
funds not held in trust, to pay other expenses relating to such transaction 
such as reimbursement to insiders for out-of-pocket expenses, third party due 
diligence expenses or potential finders fees, in each case only upon the 
consummation of a business transaction. In the event there are funds 
remaining in the trust account after satisfaction of all of such obligations, 
such funds may be used to finance operations of the target business or to 
effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of directors at that 
time. All amounts held in the trust account will be released to us on the 
closing of our initial business transaction with a target business, subject to 
any amounts payable upon the exercise of tender offer or redemption rights, 
as applicable. 

We intend to use a portion of the $1,000,000 not held in the trust account 
plus interest earned on the funds in the trust account which we are permitted 
to withdraw for working capital purposes for due diligence, legal, accounting, 
fees and expenses of the acquisition including investment banking fees, and 
other expenses, including structuring and negotiating a business transaction, 
as well as a possible down payment, reverse break up fees (a provision which 
requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition 
is not obtained), lock-up or “no-shop” provision (a provision designed to keep 
target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies 
on terms more favorable to such target businesses), if necessary. While we do 
not have any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to 
fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular proposed business 
transaction, if we were to enter into such a an agreement where we paid for 
the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that 
would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be 
determined based on the terms of the specific business transaction and the 
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds 
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not 
having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due 
diligence with respect to, potential target businesses. In addition to the 
use of funds described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to 
pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. 

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with 
a business transaction, either because the consideration for the business 
transaction is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we 
finance a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or the issuance
of our debt securities. In such event, the proceeds held in the trust account
as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance our 
operations, which may include the target business(es) that we acquire in the 
business transaction, to effect other acquisitions, or for expenses, as 
determined by our board of directors at that time. We may use these funds, 
among other things, for director and officer compensation, change-in-control 
payments or payments to affiliates, to finance the operations of the target 
business, to make other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy. 

To the extent that our capital stock or the issuance of our debt securities 
are used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business 
transaction, or in the event that indebtedness from third parties is used, in 
whole or in part, as consideration to effect a business transaction, the 
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
transaction will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with 
any other net proceeds not expended, be used to finance our operations. In 
the event that third party indebtedness is used as consideration, our 
officers and directors would not be personally liable for the repayment of 
such indebtedness. 

Alan Menkes, our chief executive officer, has loaned and advanced to us an 
aggregate of $100,862 as of March 3, 2011, which was used to pay a portion 
of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC 
filing fees, FINRA filing fees, blue sky fees, and legal and audit fees and 
expenses. The loans will be payable without interest upon the earlier of 
December 31, 2011 or on the closing of this offering. The loans will be 
repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account. 

The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trust account 
agent only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act with a maturity of 180 days or less. 
By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend 
to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the 
Investment Company Act. 

Other than a management fee of $10,000 per month, commencing on the closing 
of the offering, that we will pay to our sponsor which will be used by our 
sponsor to pay our President, Keith Oster, for services, no compensation of 
any kind (including finders, consulting or other similar fees or the issuance 
of any of our securities) will be paid to any of our sponsor, officers, 
directors or any of our or their affiliates, prior to, or for any services 
that they render in order to effectuate, or in connection with the 
consummation of, a business transaction. However, such persons will receive 
reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as 
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on 
suitable target businesses and business transactions. Reimbursement for such 
expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in the trust account 
and interest earned on the trust account and currently allocated in the above 
table to “Legal and accounting expenses attendant to the due diligence 
investigations, structuring and negotiations of a business transaction,” “Due 
diligence (excluding accounting and legal due diligence) of prospective 
targets,” “Legal and accounting fees relating to SEC reporting obligations,” 
“Administrative services and support payable to our sponsor” and “Other 
miscellaneous expenses.” There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket 
expenses reimbursable by us (except that reimbursement may not be made using 
funds in the trust account unless and until a business transaction is 
consummated). Since the role of present management after a business 
transaction is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, 
if any, will be paid to those persons after a business transaction. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(net of taxes and amounts released to us for working capital purposes) only in 
the event of our liquidation, if such public stockholder properly exercises 
his redemption rights in accordance with the conditions set forth in this 
prospectus or if we redeem our public shares for a per share pro rata portion 
of the trust account, including the interest earned thereon, but net of any 
taxes, if we do not consummate a business transaction within 15 months from 
the date of this prospectus (subject to a three month extension). In no other 
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind 
to or in the trust account. Our initial stockholders have waived their right 
to redeem any of their initial shares and placement shares for a pro rata 
share of the trust account. Additionally, our sponsor, directors and 
officers have agreed not to exercise their redemption rights with respect to 
shares acquired during or subsequent to this offering. Our initial 
stockholders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with 
respect to their initial shares and placement shares upon our redemption of 
shares sold in this offering if we fail to consummate an initial business 
transaction within 15 months (subject to a three month extension). However, if 
our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire shares 
in or after this offering, they will be entitled to a pro rata share of the 
trust account with respect to such shares upon our redemption in the event we 
do not consummate a business transaction within the required time period. We 
and our directors and officers have agreed not to propose any amendment to 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the 
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem the public shares."

million, after deducting the underwriting discount, structuring fees and 
offering expenses based on the initial public offering price of $20.00 per 
common unit. 
  
We will use approximately $32.2 million of the net proceeds received from 
this offering to retire intercompany indebtedness owed by our predecessor to 
TETRA, which we will assume as partial consideration for the assets we acquire
from TETRA in connection with this offering. We will also use approximately 
$375,000 of the net proceeds to pay financing fees and transaction costs in 
connection with the closing of the revolving credit facility. The balance of 
the net proceeds of this offering (approximately $9.9 million) will be 
available for general partnership purposes, which include funding the 
manufacturing of compressor units and the acquisition of field trucks and 
other equipment, as needed, and otherwise investing in short-term interest
bearing securities. The indebtedness to TETRA bears interest at a rate of 
7.5% and matures on December 31, 2020. 
  
The following table summarizes our intended use of proceeds:

An aggregate of 6,026,757 common units will be issued to our general partner 
and its affiliates at the closing of this offering and up to an aggregate of 
400,500 common units will be issued to our general partner within 30 days of 
this offering. However, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
up to 400,500 additional common units within 30 days of this offering, the 
number of common units purchased by the underwriters pursuant to such 
exercise will be issued to the public instead of to our general partner. 
The net proceeds to us will not change if the underwriters exercise their 
option to purchase additional common units because the net proceeds from any 
exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units 
(approximately $7.5 million based on the initial offering price of $20.00 per 
common unit, if exercised in full) will be used to make a distribution to our 
general partner. 
  
An affiliate of one of the underwriters is the lender under our revolving 
credit facility and, in that respect, will receive a portion of the proceeds 
from this offering through the payment of fees to establish our revolving 
credit facility."

that we are offering will be approximately $85.5 million, or approximately 
$118.3 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
based upon our initial public offering price of $16.00 per share and after 
deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale 
of common stock by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to pay accrued 
and unpaid dividends on our redeemable convertible preferred stock in 
connection with the automatic conversion of such redeemable convertible 
preferred stock into common stock upon the closing of this offering. The amount
of such accrued dividends will be equal to (1) approximately $29.7 million, 
which is the amount of accrued dividends if the closing had occurred on April 
30, 2011, plus (2) approximately $26,000 per day for the period from April 30, 
2011 to the date of the closing. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds 
from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital. 
If the opportunity arises, we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to 
acquire, invest in, or obtain rights to, complementary technologies, products, 
services or businesses. We are not currently a party to any agreements or 
commitments for any such transactions, and we have no current understandings 
with respect to any such transactions. 

Management’s plans for the proceeds of this offering are subject to change due 
to unforeseen events and opportunities, and the amounts and timing of our 
actual expenditures depend on several factors, including our expansion plans 
and the amount of cash generated or used by our operations. We cannot specify 
with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the
closing of this offering. Accordingly, our management team will have broad 
discretion in using the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the use of the 
net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-
grade, interest-bearing instruments."

additional shares is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds 
will be approximately $219.2 million. 
  
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by 
the selling stockholders, although we will bear the costs, other than the 
underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with the sale of these

Other principal purposes of this offering include creating a public market
