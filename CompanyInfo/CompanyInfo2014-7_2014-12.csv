$92.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full
their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, we estimate that the
net proceeds will be approximately $106.8 million after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. In addition, upon the closing of this offering, we will receive gross
proceeds of approximately $10.0 million from the sale of 588,235 shares of our
common stock which Regeneron has contractually agreed to purchase in the
concurrent private placement at the public offering price of $17.00 per share.

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement as follows:

. approximately $20 million to fund Phase 3 research and development start up
  activities for our AVA-101 study to evaluate safety and efficacy in        
  subjects with wet AMD;                                                     

. approximately $15 million to fund direct Phase 1/2 research and development
  expenses for our AVA-201 product candidates and other potential product    
  candidates in our development program; and                                 

. the remainder for potential future research and development programs,      
  including our share of development costs for additional therapeutic targets
  we may choose to pursue under our collaboration with Regeneron, as well as 
  capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development and
commercialization process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact
amounts of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement that may be used for the above purposes. Our management will have sole
and broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors including the results of our research and
development efforts, the timing and success of preclinical studies and any
ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future, the
timing of regulatory submissions, the amount of cash, if any, generated by our
collaboration with Regeneron and any future collaboration partners and any
unforeseen cash needs.

We do not anticipate that net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement will enable us to complete our Phase 3 trials or our Phase 1/2
trials of AVA-101 or our other product candidates and we will require
substantial future capital in order to complete the remaining clinical
development and to potentially commercialize these product candidates.

Pending the use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing investment-grade securities or government
securities."
"CATALENT, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/catalent-inc-925423-74481,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/catalent-inc-925423-74481,424B1,8/1/2014,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10124509,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock in
this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $822.7 million
(or $946.8 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to:

. pay a termination fee equal to approximately $29.8 million to Blackstone and 
  certain of the other existing owners; 

. redeem the outstanding $297.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 
  9 3⁄4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 for a total redemption price of 
  $313.2 million (including accrued and unpaid interest); 

. redeem the outstanding $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 
  7 7⁄8% Senior Notes due 2018 for a total redemption price of $365.0 million 
  (including accrued and unpaid interest); and 

. use the remaining proceeds to repay $114.8 million of the $275.0 million 
  aggregate principal amount outstanding under our senior unsecured term loan 
  facility. 

Borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan facility bear interest, at our 
option, at a rate equal to the margin over either (a) a base rate determined by
reference to the higher of (1) the rate of interest published by The Wall Street
Journal as its “prime interest rate” and (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or
(b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for deposits in 
the currency of such borrowing for the interest period relevant to such 
borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. Under the senior unsecured term
loan, the applicable margin is 5.25% for loans based on a LIBOR rate and 4.25% 
for loans based on the base rate. The LIBOR rate is subject to a floor of 1.25% 
and the base rate is subject to a floor of 2.25%. Our senior unsecured term 
loan facility matures December 31, 2017."

stock in this offering will be approximately $115.7 million after deducting
approximately $8.9 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and
approximately $2.8 million in estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $133.4 million after deducting approximately
$10.3 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately $2.8
million in estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal reasons for this offering are to access the public capital markets
and increase our capitalization, financial flexibility and visibility in the
marketplace. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of common stock by
us in this offering:

•   to pay a previously declared cash dividend of $50 million on shares of our    
    common stock outstanding on the business day immediately prior to the closing 
    date of this offering (after giving effect to the conversion of all of our    
    outstanding convertible preferred stock and redeemable convertible preferred  
    stock into shares of common stock). Our executive officers, directors,        
    beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding shares of capital stock,   
    and affiliated entities, will receive approximately $27.3 million, or 54.5%,  
    of such dividend amount; and                                                  

•   to pay a cash dividend of approximately $345,000 on shares of our outstanding 
    series D-3 redeemable convertible preferred stock accrued through the date of 
    conversion of such shares into common stock, which will occur on the business 
    day immediately prior to the closing date of this offering. Our executive     
    officers, directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding shares
    of capital stock, and affiliated entities, will receive approximately         
    $330,000, or 95.5%, of such dividend amount.                                  

But for the uses described above, we do not have a specific plan for the use of
the remaining net proceeds of this offering; rather we intend to use such net
proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to
finance our growth, hire additional personnel and fund capital expenditures and
potential acquisitions.

We may pursue the acquisition of companies or businesses with complementary
products and technologies that we believe will enhance our business; however, we
do not have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this
time.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering is based upon our
present plans and business condition. As of the date of this prospectus, we
cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds
that we receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion 
in using these proceeds. Furthermore, the amount and timing of our actual 
expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the cash used in or 
generated by our operations, the status of our development activities, the level
of our sales and marketing activities, our technology investments and any
potential acquisitions. Our management also has discretion over many of these
factors.

Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to
invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term and
intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade investments,
certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government."

approximately $47.8 million, or $55.2 million if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional ordinary shares, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as
follows:

.  between $25 million and $35 million for the clinical and regulatory 
   development of CureXcell, which includes between $10 million and $15 million
   for our ongoing Phase 3 DFU clinical trial and between $15 million and $20 
   million for our ongoing Phase 3 VLU clinical trial;               

.  between $15 million and $20 million to establish our commercial manufacturing
   capabilities in the United States; and                      

.  the balance, if any, for other general corporate purposes, which may include
   the development of our platform for regenerative medicine products.

We expect that the proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to allow us to
complete our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials, seek FDA approval for CureXcell
and establish the manufacturing capabilities necessary to support the launch of
CureXcell in the United States if we receive applicable marketing approvals,
however, we are subject to substantial risks that could require us to obtain
additional funding in order to achieve these objectives.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the relative
success and cost of clinical and regulatory development programs and the amount
and timing of product revenue, if any. In addition, we might decide to postpone
or not pursue certain activities if, among other factors, the net proceeds from
this offering and our other sources of cash are less than expected. As a result,
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds,
and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the
net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing investment-grade securities or deposits."

stock in this offering will be approximately $40.4 million (or approximately 
$46.6 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional 
shares in full), based on the initial public offering price of $8.00 per share 
after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering costs payable 
by us.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to advance the 
development of ganaxolone and for other working capital and general corporate 
purposes as follows:

. approximately $16.0 million to increase the size of our Phase 2b clinical 
  trial for subjects with focal onset seizures;

. approximately $10.0 million to complete manufacturing scale-up, conduct 
  related Phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies and other critical path activities 
  for ganaxolone in patients with focal onset seizures and complete development 
  of intravenous ganaxolone formulation;

. approximately $7.0 million to complete other preclinical studies, including 
  an animal carcinogenicity study;

. approximately $2.5 million to add investigator sites to accelerate enrollment 
  in our randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover Phase 2 clinical trial for 
  FXS and to initiate a proof-of-concept trial for PCDH19 female pediatric 
  epilepsy; and

. the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and 
cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund 
our operations for at least the 24 months following the date of this 
prospectus, although there can be no assurance in that regard.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and other development 
efforts for ganaxolone and other factors, as well as the amount of cash used in 
our operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds 
for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of the 
net proceeds. Pending application of the net proceeds, we may invest temporarily
in mutual and money market funds, bank certificates of deposit and investment 
grade commercial paper, corporate notes and government securities."

initial public offering price of $11.00 per share, after deducting the

this offering will be approximately $2.8 billion (or $3.2 billion if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of our
common stock from us), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses.

Prior to the completion of this offering, we will enter into the $8.0 billion
New Bank Term Loan Facility and the $1.5 billion New GECC Term Loan Facility.

We also currently intend to issue approximately $3.0 billion of senior unsecured
debt securities in the Planned Debt Offering shortly after the completion of
this offering. We cannot assure you that the Planned Debt Offering will be
completed or, if completed, on what terms it will be completed.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with the net
proceeds from borrowings under the New Bank Term Loan Facility and the New GECC
Term Loan Facility, to repay all of our related party debt owed to GECC and its
affiliates that is outstanding on the date of the closing of this offering (the
“Outstanding Related Party Debt”), to increase our capital, to invest in liquid
assets to increase the size of our liquidity portfolio, to pay fees and expenses
related to the Transactions and for such additional uses as we may determine in
the future. The weighted average interest rate on the Outstanding Related Party
Debt for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the three months ended March 31,
2014 was 1.7% and 2.3% per annum, respectively.

The New GECC Term Loan Facility is being entered into to formalize the lending
relationship between GECC and the Company in light of the offering and expected
Separation and to reflect the fact that the Company will no longer be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of GECC. The New GECC Term Loan Facility will have a
five-year maturity, thus providing financing for a transitional period following
the offering and the expected Separation, and will bear interest at a higher
rate than the Outstanding Related Party Debt being repaid.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the Planned Debt Offering to invest in
liquid assets to further increase the size of our liquidity portfolio and to pay
fees and expenses related to that offering and for such additional uses as we
may determine in the future.

The following table summarizes the estimated sources of funds and uses of funds
in connection with the Transactions. The amounts in the tables below are based
on estimated amounts and may differ from the actual amounts at the time of the
consummation of this offering depending on several factors, including
differences from our estimates of the amount of the Planned Debt Offering, the
Outstanding Related Party Debt and fees and expenses.

this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts, structuring
fee and offering expenses, to purchase from OpCo a 4.2% limited partner interest
in OpCo. The 4.2% interest in OpCo purchased with the proceeds from this
offering, when combined with the 5.8% interest in OpCo contributed to us in
connection with the formation transactions, will result in our ownership of a
10% limited partner interest in OpCo following the closing of the offering.

We estimate that, during the period from two years before the anticipated date
of closing of this offering through July 31, 2013, Westlake incurred
approximately $155.7 million in capital expenditures (the “Pre-August 2013
Capex”) with respect to the assets contributed to OpCo. The portion of these
capital expenditures incurred before January 1, 2013 was not accounted for as a
liability in our Predecessor’s historical combined carve-out financial data but
as Net investment, as it was equity funded, and the portion of these capital
expenditures incurred from January 1, 2013 and through July 31, 2013 was
accounted for as a liability and is reflected on our Predecessor’s historical
combined carve-out financial data and the associated liability will be retained
by Westlake in connection with the closing of this offering. OpCo will use any
remaining net proceeds from this offering (after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts, structuring fee, offering expenses and $55.4 million to
establish the turnaround reserve) to reimburse Westlake for these capital
expenditures and to repay intercompany debt to Westlake under the August 2013
Promissory Notes, as described below.

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 1,687,500 additional
common units in full, the additional net proceeds would be approximately $37.9
million. The net proceeds from any exercise of such option will be used to
purchase an additional limited partner interest in OpCo, and OpCo will use such
net proceeds to repay intercompany debt to Westlake under the August 2013
Promissory Notes, as described below. The amount of the additional interest in
OpCo purchased will depend on the amount of the option exercised, and will be
calculated at approximately 0.4% additional limited partner interest in OpCo
purchased for each one million of additional common units purchased by the
underwriters. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
common units in full, we would purchase an additional 0.6% limited partner
interest in OpCo and our total ownership interest in OpCo would be 10.6%.

As of June 30, 2014, our Predecessor had $231.1 million in outstanding
indebtedness payable to Westlake under the intercompany notes that OpCo will
assume in connection with this offering and will repay, in part, with a portion
of the net proceeds from this offering. Our Predecessor used the amounts loaned
under these notes (the “August 2013 Promissory Notes”) to fund capital
expenditures after August 1, 2013. Each of the intercompany notes has a maturity
date of August 1, 2023 and bears interest at the prime rate plus 1.5%."

NuDevco Note has an initial principal amount of $50,000, bears interest at a
rate of 3.0% per annum, and was issued by us as consideration for NuDevco Retail
Holdings’ transfer to us of 2,778 Spark HoldCo units.

We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate
of 450,000 additional shares of our Class A common stock. If the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common
stock from us, we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $54.3
million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, structuring
fees and estimated offering expenses.

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock, we intend to use the net proceeds from any exercise of
such option to acquire an additional number Spark HoldCo units from NuDevco
Retail Holdings equal to the number of additional shares of our Class A common
stock purchased by the underwriters. In connection with such acquisition, a
corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock owned by NuDevco Retail
Holdings will be cancelled. We will not retain any of the net proceeds from the
exercise by the underwriters of their option."

approximately $17 million through the sale of equity securities.

cash and cash equivalents, for the following purposes:

. approximately $15 million for the development of XaraColl;

. approximately $27 million for the development of Cogenzia;

. approximately $7 million for the development of CollaGUARD;

. approximately $10 million for expanding our manufacturing infrastructure; and

. the remainder for general corporate purposes.

We expect that the amounts set forth above for the development of XaraColl and
Cogeniza will allow us to complete our currently planned Phase 3 clinical
programs for XaraColl in the United States and for Cogenzia in the United States
and Europe in DFIs until pivotal data is received, in each case expected for
late 2015. For CollaGUARD, subject to the results of our planned pre-IDE meeting
with the FDA, we expect that the amount set forth above will allow us to conduct
a pivotal trial for its approval in the United States, with pivotal data results
expected in 2016.

Amounts included in general corporate purposes include approximately $3 million
in bonuses accrued to our employees, including each of our executive officers
from 2008 through 2013 but not paid, which are expected to be satisfied
following the closing of this offering. We intend to spend approximately
$10 million in addition to the amounts set forth above for expanding our
manufacturing infrastructure, which we expect to fund either through debt
financing or existing cash and revenue.

estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$66.6 million.

As of March 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $12.8 million. In
April 2014, we borrowed $15.0 million aggregate principal amount under a new
credit facility with MidCap and SVB and then used $1.9 million of this amount to
repay $1.7 million of aggregate principal amount of indebtedness and pay
$0.2 million of other amounts due in connection with our termination of a prior

interest rate of 8.25% on outstanding borrowings and matures in full in March
2018. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, including
remaining proceeds from amounts borrowed under our credit facility with MidCap
and SVB, as follows:

• approximately $5.0 million to $6.0 million to complete our Phase 3        
  clinical trials of OTX-DP for the treatment of ocular inflammation and    
  pain following cataract surgery and for the submission of an NDA to the   
  FDA, assuming favorable clinical results;                                 
 
• approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million to complete our Phase 2        
  clinical trials of OTX-DP for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and
  for the submission of an NDA supplement to the FDA, assuming favorable    
  clinical results;                                                         

• approximately $6.0 million to $7.0 million to complete our Phase 2b       
  clinical trial and initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of OTX-TP for the    
  treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension;                            

• approximately $23.0 million to $24.0 million for other clinical and       
  regulatory activities and for preclinical research and development

• approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million for sales and marketing        
  activities, including the commercial launch of OTX-DP for the treatment of
  ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery, assuming FDA     
  approval of this product, personnel costs, travel, tradeshows and other   
  sales and marketing expenses;

  and interest under our credit facility with MidCap and SVB; and           

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,   
  which could include the acquisition or in-license of other products,      
  product candidates or technologies.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, the timing of
regulatory submissions and the outcome of regulatory review, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or understandings for any
material acquisitions or licenses of any products, businesses or technologies.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to complete our Phase 3 clinical trials of OTX-DP for 
the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery, 
submit an NDA to the FDA, assuming favorable clinical results, and commercially
launch this product candidate, assuming FDA approval; complete our Phase 2 
clinical trials of OTX-DP for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and 
submit an NDA supplement to the FDA, assuming favorable clinical results;
and complete our Phase 2b clinical trial and initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial
of OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We have based
this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not 
anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and 
cash equivalents will be sufficient to allow us to commercialize OTX-DP for the
treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, if it receives FDA approval, or to 
complete the clinical development of OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and
ocular hypertension.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government

* We intend to initiate a Phase 1 trial of PF530 in the second half of 2014. As  
  indicated elsewhere in this prospectus, Strides Arcolab is responsible for     
  funding third-party costs up to Phase 3 trials, at which time we share revenue 
  and costs associated with the development of PF530.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon
the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on
the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts and the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties and any unforeseen cash needs. Our management will have broad discretion
in the application of the net proceeds to us from this offering, and investors
will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of
the proceeds. Pending their use, we plan to invest our net proceeds from this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

this offering will be approximately $53.2 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares, we estimate that our net
proceeds will be approximately $61.6 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses.

We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2014 will
enable us to complete our on-going Phase 1 clinical trials for G100, G305 and
LV305. The principal purpose of this offering is to obtain additional capital to
support continued development of our product candidates, including into Phase 2
clinical trials. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this
offering for the following purposes:

.   $28.5 million to fully fund Phase 2 clinical trials of CMB305, including   
    completion of a randomized trial in a high-incidence tumor and an          
    exploratory trial comparing LV305 and CMB305 in the same tumor types;      

.   $2.3 million to fully fund an additional Phase 1 clinical trial of G100 in 
    a second indication; and                                                   

.   the remainder would fund working capital and general corporate purposes,   
    including potential future development programs, early-stage research and  
    development, continued development of our DCVex and GLAAS platform         
    technologies, and research and development personnel and overhead expenses.

In addition, we intend to establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate access to the public capital markets.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
progress of our preclinical and clinical development efforts. As a result, our
management will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds from this
offering. Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
for the acquisition or licensing, as the case may be, of product candidates,
technologies, compounds, other assets or complementary businesses, we have no
current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so. Pending these uses,
we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash
equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our
operations for at least the next 12 months."

this offering will be $15.6 million, based on the initial public offering price
of $5.00 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses. Although our net proceeds will
increase by approximately $2.9 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full, we have agreed with the Target Sellers
to pay all of the net proceeds received as additional cash consideration to them
in the same proportions as the closing cash consideration will be paid upon the
consummation of this offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund the cash portion of
the purchase price for the Target Sellers in the amount of approximately $11.3
million, to pay brokerage fees in the amount of approximately $600,000 in
connection with the acquisition of the Target Sellers, and to pay the legal,
accounting and other fees associated with this offering. In the event the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of common stock
from us, the proceeds payable to us from the exercise of such option, net of the
underwriting discount, will be paid to the Target Sellers, in the same
proportions as the closing cash consideration. If the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional shares is exercised in full, the aggregate cash
consideration will increase to approximately $14.1 million. We will use the
remaining proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
including the expansion of our sales and marketing team, and the enhancement of
our products and services. In addition, we may also use a portion of the net
proceeds for the acquisition of or investment in the businesses or assets of
other medical billing companies that we believe are complementary to our present
business. Other than with respect to the Target Sellers, we have not entered
into any agreement or commitment with respect to any acquisitions or investments
at this time.

Other than the cash portion of the purchase price for the Target Sellers and the
other items specified above, we have not allocated any specific portion of the
net proceeds to any particular purpose, and our management will have the
discretion to allocate the proceeds as it determines. Furthermore, the amount
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including
the cash used in or generated by our operations, the pace of the integration of
the Target Sellers businesses, the level of our sales and marketing activities
and the attractiveness of any additional acquisitions or investments. Pending
the use of the proceeds from this offering described above, we plan to invest
the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in highly liquid short-term
interest-bearing obligations, investment grade investments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

$35.7 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses.

The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a
public market for our common shares. We intend to use the net proceeds as
follows:

. approximately $8 – 10 million to repay all or part of our U.S. subsidiary’s 
  working capital facility with Bridge Bank, as well as certain lines of credit
  of our principal Argentine subsidiary. Advances under the working capital 
  facility accrue interest at Bridge Bank’s prime rate plus an applicable 
  margin ranging from 3.25% to 4.00%, depending on the amounts drawn, which is 
  due monthly, and the maturity date of the facility is May 6, 2015. Our 
  principal Argentine subsidiary’s lines of credit are denominated in Argentine
  pesos and bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 7.0% to 21.5% and have 
  maturity dates ranging from June 2014 to December 2017; 

. approximately $10 – 12 million for capital expenditures associated with 
  investments in new offices and IT infrastructure to support our planned 
  growth; 

. approximately $12 – 15 million for future strategic acquisitions of, or 
  investments in, other businesses or technologies that we believe will 
  complement our current business and expansion strategies. We have no 
  definitive agreements or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions
  or investments, however, we continue to seek new acquisition opportunities; 
  and 

. any remaining amount for general corporate and working capital purposes. 

However, we have no specific allocation for the use of the net proceeds to us
from this offering, and our management retains the right to utilize the net
proceeds as it determines. The actual allocation of our resources to the above
or other uses will depend on the needs and opportunities that our management
perceives at the time of allocation.

Pending such use, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a diversified
portfolio of short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities, such as
certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, government
obligations and sovereign and corporate bonds.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common shares by the
selling shareholders."

product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this

Indebtedness under the Bridge Facility bears interest at 7.0% and matures on the
earlier of August 28, 2015 and the date all loans under the Bridge Facility
become due and payable in full thereunder, whether by acceleration or otherwise.
The approximately $9.0 million of project-level indebtedness of the U.S.
Projects 2009-2013 to be repaid with a portion of the net proceeds of this
offering bears interest at interest rates between 5.25-7.50% and matures at
various times between 2016 and 2031. The approximately $38.0 million of
project-level indebtedness of the Stonehenge Operating projects to be repaid
with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering bears interest at interest
rates between 3.75-4.51%, and matures in 2028.

administrative agent and one of the lenders under, our Bridge Facility. The
remaining lenders are affiliates of Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global
Markets Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Santander Investment Securities Inc.
Because affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Santander Investment

conflict of interest under FINRA Rule 5121. Accordingly, this offering is being
made in compliance with the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121. 

Our Sponsor will not receive any of the net proceeds or other consideration in
connection with this offering, other than: (i) the net proceeds used by us to
purchase Class B units (and share of Class B common stock) from our Sponsor,
including in the event the underwriters’ exercise their option to purchase
additional shares; (ii) the Class B common stock, Class B units of Terra LLC and
the IDRs issued to it in the Offering Transactions; and (iii) any proceeds it
receives from our acquisition of certain projects at the completion of this
offering. The Class B common stock will not entitle our Sponsor to any
economic interest in TerraForm Power and the Class B units will entitle our
Sponsor, subject to certain limitations on distributions to holders of Class B
units during the Subordination Period and the Distribution Forbearance Period,
to a 66.8% economic interest in Terra LLC."

flexibility, create a public market for our stock, obtain additional capital and
increase our visibility in the marketplace. As of the date of this prospectus,

$29.0 million outstanding under our subordinated term loan with PEPI Capital,
L.P., entities associated with Highland Consumer Fund, The Robert Wood Johnson

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    and advances from one of our sponsors, Apple Orange LLC, of $200,000 as     
    described in this prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of 
    this offering.                                                              

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%  
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, up to $6,475,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s 
    deferred commissions (or up to $7,446,250 if the underwriter’s              
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter 
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be   
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination   
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business   
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working        
    capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.                            

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect    
    approximately $100,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the    
    funds held in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This 
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.025% per annum based upon current    
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.            

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing. This amount does not include any investment banking fees which   
    may be payable upon consummation of a business combination. Macquarie       
    Capital has not yet been retained for a specific financial advisory,        
    underwriting, capital raising or other transaction and so we are not able to
    quantify the fees for any such engagement. No funds will be paid out of the 
    trust to fund any such fee payments and it is not expected that any fees    
    would be paid prior to the consummation of a business combination. The      
    actual amount of fees received will vary significantly based on the size of 
    any transaction and the extent to which other investment banks are involved.

(6) In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
    business combination, our sponsors, their respective affiliates or          
    designees, have committed $500,000 each, for an aggregate of $1,000,000, to 
    be provided to us to fund our expenses relating to investigating and        
    selecting a target business and other working capital requirements after    
    this offering and prior to our initial business combination.                

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $185,000,000 (or approximately $212,750,000 if
the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$6,475,000 (or up to $7,446,250 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
trust account located in the United States and held at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Based upon current interest rates, we expect the trust account to
generate approximately $100,000 of interest during the next 24 months. We will
not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust
account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes and to fund working
capital requirements, until the earlier of the completion of our initial 
business combination or the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are 
unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of 
this offering (subject to the requirements of law). Based on current interest 
rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be 
sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsors, members of our management team or
their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds
to, or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay Terrapin Partners, LLC, an affiliate of our Terrapin sponsor a total of
$10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, Apple Orange LLC, one of our sponsors,
has loaned and advanced us $200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at
the earlier of September 30, 2014 or the closing of this offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsors, their respective affiliates
or designees, have committed $500,000 each, for an aggregate of $1,000,000, to
be provided to us in the event that funds held outside of the trust are
insufficient to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a
target business and other working capital requirements after this offering and
prior to our initial business combination and may, but are not obligated to,
loan us additional funds to fund our expenses relating to investigating and
completing our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the initial
stockholders.

MIHI LLC, one of our sponsors and a subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited, or
Macquarie (ASX: MQG), has agreed to enter into a contingent forward purchase
contract with us to purchase, in a private placement for gross proceeds of
approximately $40,000,000 to occur concurrently with the consummation of our
initial business combination, 4,000,000 of our units on substantially the same
terms as the sale of units in this offering at $10.00 per unit, and 1,000,000
shares of Class F common stock on the same terms as the sale of shares of Class
F common stock to our sponsors prior to this offering. The funds from the sale
of units will be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial
business combination; any excess funds from this private placement of units will
be used for working capital in the post-transaction company. This commitment is
independent of the percentage of stockholders electing to redeem their shares
and provides us with a minimum funding level for the initial business
combination. The contingent forward purchase contract is contingent upon, among
other things, our Macquarie sponsor approving the business combination, which
approval can be withheld for any reason.

In addition, we have granted Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. a right of first
refusal for a period of 36 months from the closing of this offering to provide
certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services
for which they may receive fees.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our Class A common
stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the
limitations described herein or the redemption of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our business combination within 24 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements)
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsors or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, or 
approximately $61.8 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our 
access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to use the net
proceeds from this offering as follows:

. $8.0 million as partial payment for a reduction in the royalty rate payable 
  by us pursuant to the amendment to our license agreement with Gen-Probe;

. $6.0 million in payments to Gen-Probe upon achievement of certain revenue 
  milestones;

. approximately $18.0 million for the commercialization of our Atlas Detection 
  Assays; and

. approximately $12.0 million for research and development activities, 
  including the continued development and enhancement of our molecular assay 
  portfolio and the development of the mini Atlas instrument.

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the costs of 
operating as a public company. Although we currently anticipate that we will 
use the net proceeds from this offering as described above, there may be 
circumstances where a reallocation of funds is necessary. The amounts and 
timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including 
our sales and marketing and commercialization efforts, demand for our products, 
our operating costs and the other factors. Accordingly, our management will 
have flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering. An investor 
will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other 
information on which we base our decisions on how to use the proceeds.

Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the 
acquisition or licensing, as the case may be, of additional technologies, other 
assets or businesses, or for other strategic investments or opportunities, we 
have no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government 
securities."
"CAREDX, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/caredx-inc-394296-75619,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/caredx-inc-394296-75619,424B4,7/18/2014,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10100816,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in this
offering will be approximately $34.2 million, based upon an initial public
offering price of $10.00 per share, and after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, we
estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $39.8 million, after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

.  approximately $19.7 million for research and development, including research 
   aimed at expanding the clinical utility of AlloMap and the development of 
   new solutions for the surveillance of heart and kidney transplant recipients;
                                                 
.  approximately $12.8 million for sales and marketing activities, including 
   expansion of our sales force to support the ongoing commercialization of our 
   products; and                                  

.  the remainder for general and administrative expenses (including personnel 
   related costs and the costs of operating as a public company), and for 
   working capital and other general corporate purposes.           

The expected use of proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based
on our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our commercialization efforts, the status of additional payer
reimbursement coverage determinations for our AlloMap solution and the results
of our research and development efforts. If our research and development of new
solutions for the surveillance of heart and kidney transplants requires more
time or resources than we currently anticipate or if we encounter unforeseen
difficulties in securing reimbursement for our AlloMap solution or future
surveillance solutions, we may allocate additional proceeds of this offering to
our research and development efforts. If our research and development efforts
progress faster than we currently expect, we may elect to reallocate a portion
of the proceeds of this offering from research and development to sales and
marketing activities to support the launch and commercialization of our new
solutions. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for
the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that
complement our business. However, except for our proposed acquisition of
ImmuMetrix, Inc., which is described elsewhere in this prospectus, we have no
present commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions or
investments. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as
money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."

stock in this offering will be approximately $10.8 million (or $12.5 million if 
the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full), and after 
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of $0.8 million payable by us.

We intend to use approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million of the net proceeds from
this offering to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, approximately $1.0
to $1.5 million to fund research and development of our products and product
candidates, and approximately $1.0 to $1.5 million for working capital and other
general corporate purposes. We also plan to use the remainder of the funds for
potential acquisitions of products or businesses that expand or complement our
current business, as opportunities may arise, if at all. We currently do not
have any agreements or commitments relating to any potential acquisitions for
which we would use any of the net proceeds and we may not complete any such
future acquisitions.

The amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of 
factors, including the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive 
and technological developments, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business.
We reserve the right to reallocate the proceeds of this offering in response to
these and other contingencies. Accordingly, our management will have broad 
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying
on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of 
this offering.

The other principal purposes of this offering are to:

             • increase our visibility in the markets we serve;

             • strengthen our balance sheet;

             • create a public market for our common stock;

             • facilitate our future access to the public capital markets;

             • provide liquidity for existing stockholders; and

             • improve the effectiveness of our equity compensation plans in
               attracting and retaining key employees.

We intend to invest the net proceeds in short and intermediate-term
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government and bank demand
deposits, pending their use as described above."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we       
    received as a loan from 1347 Capital LLC described below. These funds will  
    be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. 

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units or $15 Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants. 

(3) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our   
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including 
    a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total 
    gross proceeds raised in the offering described below, less up to 30% of 
    such fee that we may allocate to one or more other advisors that assist us 
    in identifying or consummating an initial business combination.

(4) In addition to the $400,000 anticipated to be available to us initially     
    outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements, the     
    funds held outside the trust account also include the $125,000 loan from our
    sponsor which we can repay at any time after this offering, but must be     
    repaid no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business   
    combination.  

(5) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at
    $400,000 even if the over-allotment option is exercised. In addition,       
    interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after      
    payment of taxes owed on such interest income) will be available to us to   
    pay for our working capital requirements. We estimate the interest earned on
    the trust account will be approximately $80,000 over a 24-month period      
    assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.1% per year. 

(6) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial        
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business    
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our       
    intended use of proceeds. 

Our insiders (and/or their designees) have committed that they will purchase the
private units and $15 Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants (for an aggregate purchase
price of $2,100,000) from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with
the consummation of this offering. Our insiders have also agreed that if the
over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they
will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of private units
(up to a maximum of 18,000 private units) that is necessary to maintain in the
trust account an amount equal to $10.00 per share of common stock sold to the
public in this offering. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account described below.

$40,000,000, or $46,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units and $15
Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants, will be placed in a trust account in the United
States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, as trustee. The funds held in the trust account will be invested
only in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes having a
maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (1)
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to
us to pay our income or other tax obligations and (2) interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working
capital requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust
account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business
with which we complete our initial business combination to the extent not used
to pay converting stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

The payment to 1347 Capital LLC, an affiliate of our sponsor, of a monthly fee
of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. However, pursuant to the terms of such
agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by our
audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay
actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business
combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and
payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business
combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by 1347 Capital LLC for our
benefit. We believe that the fee charged by 1347 Capital LLC is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination
or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than
the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s fees,
consulting fees or other similar compensation) will be paid to our insiders,
members of our management team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our 
initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as 
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on 
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to 
and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target 
businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present management 
after our initial business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to 
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our 
initial business combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $400,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for our
initial business combination. We intend to use the after-tax interest earned for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our insiders, officers and directors in
connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available to us from the trust account is insufficient as a result of
the current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including a fee
payable to EarlyBirdCapital in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total gross
proceeds raised in the offering upon consummation of our initial business
combination for acting as our investment banker on a non-exclusive basis to
assist us in structuring and negotiating a business combination (but not for the
purpose of identifying a target business), less up to 30% of such fee that we
may allocate to one or more other advisors that assist us in identifying or
consummating an initial business combination. To the extent that our capital
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial
business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used
to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company
and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing,
research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Kingsway and FMG have agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of April 17, 2014, our sponsor loaned to us an aggregate of $125,000 to be
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and
expenses. The terms of this loan were amended and restated as of April 18, 2014.
The loan is payable without interest no later than the date on which our initial
business combination is consummated.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our 
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if 
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the 
consummation of this offering, our insiders, officers and directors (and/or 
their designees) may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to 
time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole 
discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would 
either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without 
interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be 
converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private
units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the 
holders being issued 55,000 shares of common stock if $500,000 of notes were so
converted since the 50,000 rights included in the private units would result in
the issuance of 5,000 shares of common stock upon the closing of our business 
combination, as well as 50,000 warrants to purchase 25,000 shares). Our 
stockholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of
such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the 
time of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not 
complete a business combination, the $125,000 loan from our sponsor, and any 
other outstanding loans from our insiders, officers and directors or their 
affiliates, will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust 
account, if any. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period or
(2) if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection
with a stockholder vote. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

  upon completion of this offering or within the next 12 months, which we    
  estimate to aggregate to $2.1 million in principal amount plus             
  approximately $207,000 in interest through June 24, 2014;                  

· to repay $1.5 million in principal amount, together with approximately     
  $192,000 in accrued but unpaid interest thereon through June 24, 2014, that
  we borrowed to fund our acquisition of Select Money Mobile from            
  DeviceFidelity in March 2014;

of these borrowings were made to fund our working capital needs, other than the
$1.5 million in principal amount borrowed at 24% per annum, which borrowing was
made to fund our acquisition of the Select Mobile Money business described
elsewhere in this prospectus.
 
As indicated above, some portion of our net proceeds may be used to acquire new

of common stock in this offering will be approximately $12.3 million (or
approximately $14.4 million if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is
exercised in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We currently expect
to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• Approximately $5.0 million to advance an additional infectious disease    
  product into clinical trials and through a Phase 1 study;                 

• Approximately $5.0 million to prepare our manufacturing facility for      
  clinical trial and commercial scale manufacturing;                        

• Approximately $1.0 million for completion of ongoing clinical trials for  
  GI-6207, GI-6301 and GI-4000, including manufacturing of drug supply for  
  such trials; and                                                          

• The remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,   
  including hiring of additional personnel and expenses associated with     
  being a public company.                                                   

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and
cash equivalents, and contingent, future milestone payments under our
collaboration agreements, will allow us to fund our operations through 2015.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intention
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the ongoing status
of, and results from, clinical trials and other studies, achievement of
milestones under our existing collaborations, any additional collaborations that
we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any
unforeseen cash needs. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital
significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate or to alter our
operations. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be
wrong, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we
currently expect. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds
in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
interest-bearing investment grade securities, certificates of deposit or
government securities."

be approximately $36.2 million (or approximately $41.8 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of
common stock from us), after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering (substantially all of which
we intend to contribute to the capital of the Bank after repaying amounts
outstanding under the line of credit discussed below) primarily to support
growth in our loan and investment securities portfolios, to bolster our capital
in light of the heightened capital standards under the Basel III accord, to
permit future strategic acquisitions and for other general working capital and
corporate purposes, all while maintaining our capital ratios at acceptable
levels. In addition, a larger capital base will increase our legal lending
limit, permitting us to make larger loans and to better penetrate our market
areas. To support our balance sheet growth while maintaining the Bank’s capital
at levels set by management until the completion of this offering, we
established a $5.0 million line of credit with another bank. This line of
credit, the entire amount of which has been drawn and contributed to the Bank
(or will have been so drawn and contributed prior to the completion of this
offering), bears interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate quoted in
The Wall Street Journal and is secured by a pledge of all of the stock of the
Bank. We intend to repay all amounts outstanding under this line of credit with
the proceeds of this offering. Although in the ordinary course of our business
we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities from time to time, we do not
have any immediate plans, arrangements or understandings relating to any
specific acquisition or similar transaction.

Our management will retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, and the precise amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds of
this offering will depend upon market conditions, as well as other factors.
Until we deploy the proceeds of this offering for the uses described above, we
expect to hold such proceeds in short-term investments."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $26.9 million, or
approximately $31.5 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, based upon the initial public offering price
of $6.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

Further, at the time of closing of this offering, we will also concurrently
(i) sell $19.7 million of common stock to JJDC in a private placement and pay
$22.0 million to Janssen in connection with our co-development and license
agreement for certain rights to MIN-202 and (ii) sell $4.0 million of our common
stock to certain former shareholders of Mind-NRG in a private placement. As a
result of these transactions, or the Private Placement Transactions, we expect
to receive an additional $1.7 million of net cash at the time of the closing of
this offering.

As of March 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 million. We
currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering and the
Private Placement Transactions, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents, as follows:

.  $15.3 million to fund MIN-101 through Phase II clinical development;

.  $5.0 million to fund MIN-202 through Phase I clinical development;

.  $0.8 million to fund pre-clinical development of MIN-301;

.  $0.6 million to repay the April Bridge Loan;

.  $1.0 million to repay the May Bridge Loan;

.  €0.5 million (or $0.7 million, as converted) to pay the ProteoSys License 
   Fee with respect to MIN-301; and

.  the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

The April Bridge Loan was provided subsequent to March 31, 2014 for working
capital purposes by Index Ventures V (Jersey), L.P., an affiliate of Index
Ventures, Limburgse Reconversiemaatschappij NV, and KMOFIN 2 NV, who became our
stockholders in connection with the Mind-NRG Acquisition, and all principal and
accrued interest must be paid in connection with the closing of this offering.
The April Bridge Loan was incurred in April 2014 and has an interest rate of 8%
per annum that is added to the original principal amount of $0.6 million.

The May Bridge Loan was provided subsequent to March 31, 2014 for working
capital purposes by certain of our stockholders and their affiliates. All
principal and accrued interest must be paid in connection with the closing of
this offering. The May Bridge Loan was incurred in May 2014 and has an interest
rate of 8% per annum. We have drawn down $0.5 million under the May Bridge Loan
as of June 10, 2014. We expect to draw down the remaining $0.5 million prior to
the closing of this offering.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering, the Private Placement Transactions and
our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through at least the end of 2015. However, these funds will not be
sufficient to complete advanced clinical development of any of our product
candidates, or if applicable, to prepare for commercializing any product
candidate which achieves approval. Accordingly, we will continue to require
substantial additional capital beyond the expected proceeds of this offering to
continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities.
Because successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are
unable to estimate the actual funds we will require to complete research and
development and commercialize our products under development.

Our intentions described above are based upon our current plans and business
conditions, and could change in the future as our plans and business conditions
evolve. In addition, the development of MIN-202 is dependent on the
contributions and willingness of our co-development partner, Janssen. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending
on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the status of
and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may
enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen
cash needs. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net
proceeds of this offering."

(1)  A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
     FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and 
     a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we    
     received from Jianming Hao described below. These funds will be repaid out 
     of the proceeds of this offering available to us.                          

(2)  The underwriting discount of 3.0% is payable at the closing of the offering
     and the deferred underwriting fee of 1.0% (and 4.0% on gross proceeds      
     received from the over-allotment option) payable to Cantor Fitzgerald is   
     payable upon consummation of our initial business combination and will be  
     held in the trust account until consummation of such business combination. 
     Additionally, in the event that investors introduced by us to the          
     underwriter do not purchase at least $30,000,000 of the units being offered
     hereby, there will be an additional underwriting commission paid to the    
     underwriter in the amount of $0.15 per unit (1.5%) on the amount below     
     $30,000,000 invested by investors introduced by us, which will not affect  
     the amount in trust due to the obligation of our initial stockholders to   
     purchase private commission units. No discounts or commissions will be 
     paid with respect to the purchase of the private units. 

(3)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $490,000  
     even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income      
     earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes    
     owed on such interest income) will be available to us to pay for our       
     working capital requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust 
     account will be approximately $35,000 over a 21-month period assuming an   
     interest rate of approximately 0.05% per year.                             

(4)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
     items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may  
     incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in  
     connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business           
     combination based upon the level of complexity of that business            
     combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of        
     proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated
     expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates  
     for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess   
     working capital.                                                           

Our initial stockholders have committed to purchase an aggregate of 210,000
private units at a price of $10.00 per unit ($2,100,000 in the aggregate). Our
initial stockholders have also agreed that if investors introduced by us to the
underwriter do not purchase at least $30,000,000 of the units being offered
hereby, they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of
private units that will equal the increased commissions we will pay the
underwriter, as described above. The purchases will take place on a private
placement basis that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this
offering. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in
the trust account described below, except that the proceeds from the sale of the
private commission units will be paid to the underwriter at the closing of this
offering.

$40,000,000, or $46,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at Smith Barney in the United States, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income
or other tax obligations and (ii) any remaining interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital
requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or
any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$490,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
(after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be released to us to
fund our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination.
We intend to use the excess working capital available for miscellaneous
expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a
target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with
the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting
and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed
our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our initial stockholders, officers and directors in connection with
activities on our behalf as described above. We will also be entitled to have
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any
tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to use the after-tax interest earned
for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with
our search for a target business and for director and officer liability
insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial stockholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our share capital is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Jianming Hao has agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of April 15, 2014, Jianming Hao loaned to us an aggregate of $117,000 to be
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and
expenses. The loan is payable without interest on the earlier of (i) April 30,
2015, (ii) the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or (iii)
the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering.
The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for
payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our initial stockholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but
are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the
units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent 
the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our 
initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business 
combination, the loans would not be repaid.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public stockholder converts such shares in
connection with a business combination which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

$40 million, or approximately $47 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, based on the initial public offering price of
$17.00 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and other
general corporate purposes, including to finance our expected growth, fund
capital expenditures, or expand our existing business through investments in or
acquisitions of other businesses, although at present we do not have any current
plans, arrangements or understandings to make any material capital investments

stock in this offering will be approximately $90.0 million, at the initial
public offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares
in full, we estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately
$104.0 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. More specifically,
we anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, together
with our existing cash, as follows:
 
     •   approximately $35.0 million to fund expenses in connection with obtaining 
         the regulatory approval and preparing for the commercialization of        
         AuriPro, if approved;                                                     

     •   approximately $35.0 million to fund OTO-104 clinical development,         
         including completion of the OTO-104 Phase 2b clinical trial and, if       
         results are positive, initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial, and         
         initiation of one or more open-label, multiple-dose safety studies in     
         Ménière’s patients;                                                       

     •   approximately $15.0 million to fund preclinical development and a Phase 1 
         clinical trial for patients with tinnitus for OTO-311; and                

     •   the remainder for research and development activities, working capital and
         general corporate purposes.                                               

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and our
existing cash to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary business,
technologies, products or assets. However, we have no current plans, commitments
or obligations to do so.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash will
be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 18 months. This
expected use of the net proceeds from the offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. We cannot specify with
certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive
from this offering, or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set
forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on
numerous factors, including the ongoing status of and results from clinical
trials and other studies, the product approval process with the FDA, and the
scope of our commercialization efforts, as well as any strategic collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, any

deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses of

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering, together with
borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to (i) redeem $99.5 million in
aggregate principal amount of the 11.25% Senior Notes due 2018 issued by Ryerson
and its wholly owned subsidiary Joseph T. Ryerson & Son Inc. (the “2018 Notes”),
(ii) pay Platinum Advisors or its affiliates $25.0 million, a portion of which
may be paid over time, as consideration for terminating the Services Agreement
and (iii) pay related redemption expenses and premiums in connection with this
offering, which we currently expect to equal approximately $15.7 million. We
estimate that we will borrow an additional $29.5 million under our $1.35 billion

exercised in full, the selling stockholders will receive approximately
$17.1 million after deducting the underwriting discount of $1.1 million and
assuming an initial public offering price of $11.00 per share.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds. The occurrence of unforeseen events or
changed business conditions could result in application of the net proceeds of
this offering in a manner other than as described in this prospectus.

$11.00 per share (the highpoint of the price range presented on the cover of
this prospectus). We have granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to
an aggregate of 1,500,000 additional shares of our common stock to the extent
the underwriters sell more than 10,000,000 shares of common stock in this
offering.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay

of 9,600,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting the
underwriting discounts, structuring fees and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We expect to use these net proceeds as follows: (i) $140 million to make
a loan to Höegh LNG in exchange for a note bearing interest at a rate of 5.88%
per annum, which is repayable on demand or which we can elect to utilize as part
of the purchase consideration in the event we purchase all or a portion of Höegh
LNG’s interests in the Independence, (ii) $20 million for general partnership
purposes and (iii) the remainder to make a cash distribution to Höegh LNG as
partial consideration for the interests in the entities that own the vessels in
our initial fleet.

The purchase price of our initial fleet was dependent on the initial public
offering price of our common units and is equal to the value of the $16.3
million distribution to Höegh LNG from the net proceeds of this offering, plus
3,556,060 common units and 13,156,060 subordinated units to be issued to Höegh
LNG, plus all of our incentive distribution rights.

At the initial public offering price of $20.00 per common unit and assuming that
the fair market value of each subordinated unit is $20.00 and the incentive
distribution rights is zero, the total dollar value of the consideration to be
paid to Höegh LNG for its 50% interest in the joint ventures and the 100%
interest in Höegh Lampung, the entities that own interests in the three vessels
in our initial fleet, is approximately $350.6 million.

The initial public offering price of our common units, as well as the total
consideration to be paid to Höegh LNG for the interests in the entities that own
the vessels in our initial fleet, was determined through negotiations among us
and the representatives of the underwriters.

We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,440,000
additional common units. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, we will use the net proceeds (approximately $26.9
million, if exercised in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and
structuring fees) to make an additional cash distribution to Höegh LNG. If the
underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase any additional common
units, we will issue 1,440,000 common units to Höegh LNG at the expiration of
the option period. If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option
to purchase additional common units, the number of units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the
remainder, if any, will be issued to Höegh LNG. Accordingly, the exercise of the
underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of units outstanding or
the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all
units."

all of the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placements
to our PRC subsidiary, and to convert the contributed net proceeds into RMB
after we complete applicable PRC governmental registration requirements and
receive required approvals. If we provide funding to our PRC subsidiary through
capital contributions or loans, we will need to increase our PRC subsidiary’s
approved registered capital and/or total investment amount, which requires
approval from MOFCOM or its local counterparts. If we provide funding to our PRC

SAFE, which the completion of which generally requires 20 business days or
longer. We may not be able to complete applicable governmental registrations or
obtain the required approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

regulatory authorities require us to perform additional clinical trials of
AM-101 or AM-111 in order to obtain marketing approvals. As a result, our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds of
this offering, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds. In addition, we might decide to postpone or not
pursue certain preclinical activities or clinical trials if the net proceeds
from this offering and our other sources of cash are less than expected.

We expect that our total research and development expense in 2014 will be in the
range of CHF 28 to 32 million. Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of

estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating
expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months.

FDA, any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent

Funds for our portfolio operations and working capital include, but are not
limited to, expenditures such as obtaining life expectancy reports, mortality
tracking, legal and collections expenses and other servicing costs to maintain
our portfolio. Funds for general working capital purposes included, but are not
limited to, marketing and sales expenses, as well as tax liabilities and

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. Accordingly, our
management will have broad discretion in the application of these proceeds. Net
offering proceeds not immediately applied to the uses summarized above will be
invested in short-term investments such as money market funds, commercial paper,
U.S. Treasury Bills and similar securities investments pending their use. We may
also purchase interest rate hedges to lock in our cost of capital, or longevity
hedges to lock in our expected return from our portfolio."

We intend to use the net proceeds to reduce our outstanding indebtedness and
liabilities of approximately $16 million resulting from the accelerated vesting
of employee restricted stock units and for general corporate purposes.
Specifically, we intend to use approximately $425 million of the net proceeds
from this offering to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness under our

we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $56.0 million.

As of June 30, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

with such existing cash resources, as follows:

        º approximately $14.0 million to fund the costs for progressing our
          ROR y t program through Phase 1 clinical development, which consists of
          two trials, a single dose trial and a two week multiple dose trial,
          both for VTP-43742 and to identify backup compounds;

        º approximately $4.0 million to fund the costs for progressing VTP-38443

          the treatment of ACS;

          October 2015); and

        º the remainder for working capital and other general corporate
          purposes.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. We will
require substantial future capital in order to complete the remaining clinical
development of VTP-43742, VTP-38443, VTP-38543 and our future product candidates
and to potentially commercialize these products. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, feedback from regulatory authorities,
the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties for our drug candidates, and any
unforeseen cash needs. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in

approximately $117.2 million (or $134.8 million if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock). A
$1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$21.00 per share would increase or decrease, as applicable, the net proceeds to
Medley Management Inc. from this offering by approximately $5.6 million,
assuming the number of shares offered by us remains the same as set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus and after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions. Medley LLC will bear or reimburse Medley Management

exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock) to purchase a number of newly issued LLC Units from Medley

equivalents and the proceeds from the first tranche of the Series E Financing,
as follows:

. approximately $35 million to fund research and development expenses for     
  AFM13, including phase 2a trials of AFM13 for the treatment of HL and one   
  additional study for the treatment of other forms of CD30+ malignancies, as 
  well as CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and control) work in preparation for a
  potential pivotal trial of AFM13 for the treatment of HL;                   

. approximately $8 million to fund research and development expenses for      
  AFM11, including phase 1 trials of AFM11 for the treatment of NHL and ALL;  

. approximately $10 million to fund research and development expenses for     
  AFM21, including preclinical development of AFM21;                          

. the remainder to fund other research and development activities, for working
  capital, repayment of debt and general corporate purposes.                  

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs,
including a change in our planned course of development or the termination of a
clinical program necessitated by the results of data received from clinical
trials, the amount and timing of additional revenues, if any, received from our
collaborations with Amphivena and LLS and whether we enter into future
collaborations. As a result, management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we
might decide to postpone or not pursue other clinical trials or preclinical
activities if the net proceeds from this offering and our other sources of cash
are less than expected.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next 28 months. We have based these estimates on
assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available
capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing financial assets and certificates
of deposit."

common stock in this offering of approximately $71.5 million (or $82.7 million
if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
shares), at the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion
of our existing term loan facility, including applicable prepayment penalties
and fees, in the amount of approximately $71.5 million. Our term loan facility
matures on May 31, 2019 and bears interest at LIBOR or at a base rate, plus an
applicable margin. The applicable margin rate is 5.75% with respect to a LIBOR
loan and 4.75% with respect to a base rate loan. On April 14, 2014, we amended
our term loan facility to, among other things, increase our borrowings under
that facility by approximately $30.8 million. We used the net proceeds from
those additional borrowings to fund a portion of the $39.9 million dividend that
was paid to our stockholders on April 17, 2014. As of June 28, 2014, there were 
$130.0 million in borrowings under this facility."

approximately $107.3 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option 
to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, in each case after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase an aggregate 
of 6,000,000 Holdings LP Interests from the Holdings Limited Partners and will
not retain any of these proceeds. As a result, the purchase price for the 
Holdings LP Interests will be determined by the public offering price of our 
Class A common stock in this offering, less underwriting discounts. 
Substantially all of the proceeds of this offering will flow to our executive 
officers, including the Principals. Of the total proceeds, after taking into 
account underwriting discounts and commissions but before estimated offering 
expenses payable by us, $87.6 million are allocable to Mr. Tannenbaum, or the 
Founding Principal, and the remaining $8.3 million to the other Holdings 
Limited Partners. 

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of 
Class A common stock in full, we intend to use the additional approximately 
$14.4 million of net proceeds to purchase up to an additional 900,000 Holdings

common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts,
structuring fees and estimated offering expenses. This amount assumes the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units from us is not
exercised. We intend to use (i) approximately $579.5 million of the net proceeds
of this offering to make a cash distribution to SPLC, (ii) approximately $194.0
million of the net proceeds of this offering to make a cash distribution to SPLC
and a contribution to Zydeco, which will then make a cash distribution to SPLC,
both to reimburse SPLC for capital expenditures incurred prior to this offering
related to Zydeco, and (iii) approximately $100.0 million for general
partnership purposes, including to fund potential expansion capital expenditures
and acquisitions.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to any exercise will be sold to the public, and any
remaining common units not purchased by the underwriters pursuant to any
exercise of the option will be issued to SPLC at the expiration of the option
period for no additional consideration. If the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional common units in full, the additional net proceeds

We currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds received by us for 
the following purposes: (i) approximately $13.8 million to expand our sales 
force and marketing programs, (ii) approximately $5.7 million to fund research

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid in the form  
    of loans made by our sponsors ($194,500 of which are outstanding as of the  
    date of this prospectus) as described in this prospectus. These loans will  
    be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering  
    proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other 
    than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less 
    than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing
    working capital needs.                                                      

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, up to $2,800,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions (or up to $3,220,000, depending upon the extent to     
    which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised) will be paid to 
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining
    funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of  
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our       
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or   
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest  
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.             

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account to pay taxes, if any.                                               

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing. This amount does not include any investment banking fees which   
    may be payable upon consummation of a business combination. Macquarie       
    Capital (USA) Inc. has not yet been retained for a specific financial       
    advisory, underwriting, capital raising or other transaction and so we are  
    not able to quantify the fees for any such engagement. No funds will be paid
    out of the trust to fund any such fee payments and it is not expected that  
    any fees would be paid prior to the consummation of a business combination. 
    The actual amount of fees received will vary significantly based on the size
    of any transaction and the extent to which other investment banks are       
    involved.                                                                   

(6) In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
    business combination, each of our sponsors has committed $250,000, for an   
    aggregate of $500,000, in accordance with the unsecured promissory notes we 
    will issue to our sponsors pursuant to the expense advance agreement between
    us and our sponsors, to be provided to us to fund our expenses relating to  
    investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital     
    requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business          
    combination.                                                                

NASDAQ rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering
and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net proceeds
of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, approximately
$80,000,000 (or $92,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including up to $2,800,000 (or up to $3,220,000, depending
upon the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account located
in the United States and held at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in
U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$16,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year. We will not be
permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust
account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any, until the
earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or the redemption
of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering (subject to the requirements
of law). Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that interest earned
on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsors, members of our management team or
their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds
to, or invest in, us.

We have agreed to enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to
which we will pay Lorne Weil, Inc., an affiliate of our Hydra sponsor a total of
$10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsors have loaned us $194,500 under
unsecured promissory notes, the proceeds of which are to be used for a portion
of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing,
unsecured and are due at the earlier of March 31, 2015 or the closing of this
offering. These loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of
the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of
offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, each of our sponsors has committed
$250,000, for an aggregate of $500,000, in accordance with the unsecured
promissory notes we will issue to our sponsors pursuant to the expense advance
agreement between us and our sponsors, to be provided to us in the event that
funds held outside of the trust are insufficient to fund our expenses relating
to investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital
requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business combination
and may, but are not obligated to, loan us additional funds as may be required.
If we complete our initial business combination, we expect to repay such loaned
amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such
loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the
event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion
of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned
amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such
loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of all loans made to us may be convertible into
warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant
at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants issued to the initial stockholders.

MIHI LLC, one of our sponsors and a subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited (ASX:
MQG), or Macquarie, has agreed to enter into a contingent forward purchase
contract with us to purchase, in a private placement for gross proceeds of
approximately $20,000,000 to occur concurrently with the consummation of our
initial business combination, 2,000,000 of our units (which includes 2,000,000
rights which will be exchanged for 200,000 shares of common stock) on
substantially the same terms as the sale of units in this offering at $10.00 per
unit, and 500,000 shares of common stock on the same terms as the sale of shares
of common stock to our sponsors prior to this offering. The funds from the sale
of the private placement units may be used as part of the consideration to the
sellers in the initial business combination; any excess funds from this private
placement of units may be used for working capital in the post-transaction
company. This commitment is independent of the percentage of stockholders
electing to redeem their shares and provides us with an increased minimum
funding level for the initial business combination. The contingent forward purchase contract is
contingent upon, among other things, our Macquarie sponsor approving the
business combination, which approval can be withheld for any reason.

In addition, we have granted Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. a right of first
refusal for a period of 36 months from the closing of this offering to provide
certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services
for which they may receive fees. The amount of fees we pay to Macquarie Capital
(USA) Inc. will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services
rendered by global full-service investment banks for such transactions at such
time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the
audit committee’s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may
present conflicts of interest.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsors or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

approximately $105.0 (€82.5) million, based on the public offering price of 
$21.64 per ADS in the U.S. offering and €34.00 per ordinary share in the French 
registered private placement, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and assuming no 
exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ordinary shares 
and ADSs. If the underwriters exercise in full their options to purchase 
additional ordinary shares and ADSs in the U.S. offering and additional 
ordinary shares in the French registered private placement, we estimate that 
we will receive net proceeds from the global offering of approximately $121.3 
(€95.2) million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of the global offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for our securities in the United States 
and facilitate our access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to 
use the net proceeds from the global offering as follows:

. approximately $40.0 million to advance the development of our Viaskin Peanut 
  and Viaskin Milk product candidates;

. approximately $10.0 million to fund our earlier stage development activities, 
  including our development programs in eosinophilic esophagitis and pertusiss 
  boost vaccine;

. approximately $30.0 million to build-out our clinical and commercial 
  infrastructure in the United States; and

. approximately $20.0 million to support our growth globally by expanding 
  general, administrative and operational functions in our headquarters in 
  France.

We expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from the global offering 
for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest 
in complementary technologies, products or assets. However we have no current 
plan, commitments or obligations to do so.

Based on our current operation plans and assumptions, we expect that the net 
proceeds from the global offering, combined with our current operating capital, 
will be sufficient to support the advancement of our Viaskin Peanut product 
candidate through the completion of our planned Phase III clinical trial and, 
pending the results of this trial, the submission of a BLA for this product 
candidate, as well as the advancement of our Viaskin Milk product candidate 
through the end of our planned Phase II clinical trial for this product 
candidate. However, there can be no assurance that these expectations will be 
correct.

We currently have no specific plans as to how the net proceeds from the global 
offering will be allocated beyond the uses specified above and therefore 
management will retain discretion to allocate the remainder of the net proceeds 
of the global offering among these uses.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date 
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular 
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the global 
offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth 
above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of 
clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, 
including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and results 
from pre-clinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials 
we may commence in the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter 
into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash 
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the 
allocation of the net proceeds from the global offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from the global offering, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, 
including short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

.  approximately $9.4 million to accelerate the commencement of the second of 
   our Phase 3 trials for PRT-201 in its lead indication;

.  approximately $28.4 million to accelerate our chemistry and manufacturing 
   controls, or CMC, activities;

.  approximately $1.6 million to fund additional research and development
   activities; and

.  the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes and the 
   costs associated with being a public company.

We believe that the net proceeds from the offering, together with our existing 
cash and cash equivalents and investments, will be sufficient to fund our 
projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the 
end of 2017, allowing us to obtain results from our first Phase 3 clinical
trial of PRT-201 in radiocephalic AVFs and complete our anticipated chemistry,
manufacturing and controls activities required for a BLA submission. However,
this may change if there are any significant increases beyond our expectations
in spending on development programs or more rapid progress of development
programs than anticipated. We do not expect the proceeds to be sufficient to
obtain the results from our second Phase 3 trial.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our present plans and business conditions, which could change in the 
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amount and timing of 
our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the 
results of our ongoing clinical trials and clinical trials that we may commence,
feedback from regulatory agencies, the timing of approval of any of our product 
candidates, the results of any commercialization efforts and other factors. As 
a result, our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net

$10 million principal amount additional bridge financing we entered into on
August 6, 2014 with BVF Forward (an affiliate of BVF Partners LP, which is
itself affiliated with certain of our principal shareholders), and cash and cash
equivalents on hand, as follows:

• approximately $80 million for the clinical development of FP187 for the 
  treatment of RRMS; 

• approximately $25 million to fund the exploitation and protection of our 
  intellectual property rights (including in connection with oppositions and 
  interference cases); 

• approximately $22 million for the clinical development of FP187 for the 
  treatment of psoriasis; 

• approximately $12 million for execution of our pre-clinical program, for 
  our manufacturing activities, and for related Phase 1 clinical trials; and 

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition, where we expect
to incur up to $26.0 million of costs associated with research and development
in our fiscal year ending December 31, 2014, subject to timing of our
development activities. As of the date of this Prospectus, we cannot predict
with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received
upon the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend
on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual use of net
proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors, including our ability to
obtain additional financing, the relative success and cost of our research,
pre-clinical and clinical development programs, and whether we enter into
collaborations with third parties in the future. As a result, management will
have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will
be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this
offering. In addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue other clinical
trials or pre-clinical activities if the net proceeds from this offering and our
other sources of cash are less than expected.

At present, we believe that the expected net proceeds of this offering, the
bridge financings we entered into on May 30, 2014 and August 6, 2014, and our
current cash and cash equivalents, will allow us to initiate a Phase 3 clinical
trial program for FP187 in RRMS, including the opening of approximately 200
investigational sites and the enrolment of approximately 700 subjects. We
further anticipate that the net proceeds would also enable us to complete the
initial Phase 3 trial in psoriasis. However, we anticipate that we will require
substantial additional capital to complete our development activities in RRMS
and psoriasis. We also anticipate that the net proceeds would be insufficient to
allow for the market authorization and commercialization of FP187. We further
note that it is difficult to predict our future liquidity requirements given the
uncertainty around the requirements associated with the development and
commercialization of new drugs, and we could exhaust our capital resources
earlier than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations and certificates of 
deposit."

opportunistic acquisitions or strategic investments. The revolving line of 
credit expires on July 20, 2017. At September 16, 2014, we had $80.2 million of 
borrowings outstanding and had $33.3 million of availability under the line of 
credit. We may select from two interest rate options for revolving and letter 
of credit borrowings under the line of credit: (i) LIBOR (as defined in the 
line of credit) plus 1.75% or (ii) Base Rate (as defined in the line of credit) 
plus 0.75%. The effective interest rate for Base Rate borrowings at both June 
30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was 4.00%. The effective rate on LIBOR rate 
borrowings at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was 1.90% and 1.92%, 
respectively. As a result of the repayment of our line of credit, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., lenders thereunder and affiliates 
of certain of the underwriters of this offering, will receive a portion of such 
repayment. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by 
the selling shareholders, including any shares that may be sold by the selling 
shareholders in connection with the exercise of the underwriters' option
to purchase additional shares. The selling shareholders will not be responsible
for any offering expenses, other than their proportionate share of the
underwriting discounts and commissions."

stock and Series A Warrants in this offering will be approximately $6.6 million,
based on an initial public offering price of $7.00 per unit, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. This does not include approximately $0.2 million of expenses that have
already been paid, and so will not affect use of proceeds. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
from this offering will be approximately $7.7 million.

We expect the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to fund our
operations for up to 12 months following the closing of the offering, including
the completion of our planned clinical trials and filing with the FDA for our
Group B Strep and Staph ID/R diagnostic tests. We intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering as follows:

(1) approximately $1.4 million in research and development expenses, including 
    $0.4 million for clinical development and regulatory filing of new 
    diagnostic tests, for Group B Strep and Staph ID/R;  

(2) approximately $1.4 million in sales and marketing expenses;  

(3) approximately $1.1 million to manufacture analyzers for customers;  

(4) approximately $0.2 million to begin to automate our manufacturing facility 
    and increase manufacturing capacity; and  

(5) the remaining proceeds, if any, will be used for general corporate purposes, 
    including working capital.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the status of and results from clinical trials of additional trials
and the continued market acceptance of our C. diff test. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net
proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. Furthermore,
we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding before we reach
profitability. While certain proceeds of this offering will be used for clinical
and regulatory development of our diagnostic tests for Staph ID/R and Group B
Strep, we may need to raise additional proceeds to complete the clinical and
regulatory development of these diagnostic tests. We anticipate any additional
funds necessary to complete clinical and regulatory development of these
diagnostic tests, if any, would be sought through a later public offering of
debt or equity or from existing investors.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

the completion of our planned clinical trials and filing with the FDA for our
Group B Strep and Staph ID/R diagnostic tests. We intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering as follows:

(1) approximately $1.4 million in research and development expenses, including 
    $0.4 million for clinical development and regulatory filing of new 
    diagnostic tests, for Group B Strep and Staph ID/R;  

(2) approximately $1.4 million in sales and marketing expenses;  

(3) approximately $1.1 million to manufacture analyzers for customers;  

(4) approximately $0.2 million to begin to automate our manufacturing facility 
    and increase manufacturing capacity; and  

(5) the remaining proceeds, if any, will be used for general corporate purposes, 
    including working capital.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the status of and results from clinical trials of additional trials
and the continued market acceptance of our C. diff test. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net
proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. Furthermore,
we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding before we reach
profitability. While certain proceeds of this offering will be used for clinical
and regulatory development of our diagnostic tests for Staph ID/R and Group B
Strep, we may need to raise additional proceeds to complete the clinical and
regulatory development of these diagnostic tests. We anticipate any additional
funds necessary to complete clinical and regulatory development of these
diagnostic tests, if any, would be sought through a later public offering of
debt or equity or from existing investors.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

based on an initial public offering price of $7.00 per unit, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. This does not include approximately $0.2 million of expenses that have
already been paid, and so will not affect use of proceeds. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
from this offering will be approximately $7.7 million.

We expect the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to fund our
operations for up to 12 months following the closing of the offering, including
the completion of our planned clinical trials and filing with the FDA for our
Group B Strep and Staph ID/R diagnostic tests. We intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering as follows:

(1) approximately $1.4 million in research and development expenses, including 
    $0.4 million for clinical development and regulatory filing of new 
    diagnostic tests, for Group B Strep and Staph ID/R;  

(2) approximately $1.4 million in sales and marketing expenses;  

(3) approximately $1.1 million to manufacture analyzers for customers;  

(4) approximately $0.2 million to begin to automate our manufacturing facility 
    and increase manufacturing capacity; and  

(5) the remaining proceeds, if any, will be used for general corporate purposes, 
    including working capital.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the status of and results from clinical trials of additional trials
and the continued market acceptance of our C. diff test. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net
proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. Furthermore,
we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding before we reach
profitability. While certain proceeds of this offering will be used for clinical
and regulatory development of our diagnostic tests for Staph ID/R and Group B
Strep, we may need to raise additional proceeds to complete the clinical and
regulatory development of these diagnostic tests. We anticipate any additional
funds necessary to complete clinical and regulatory development of these
diagnostic tests, if any, would be sought through a later public offering of
debt or equity or from existing investors.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. Furthermore,
we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding before we reach
profitability. While certain proceeds of this offering will be used for clinical
and regulatory development of our diagnostic tests for Staph ID/R and Group B
Strep, we may need to raise additional proceeds to complete the clinical and
regulatory development of these diagnostic tests. We anticipate any additional
funds necessary to complete clinical and regulatory development of these
diagnostic tests, if any, would be sought through a later public offering of
debt or equity or from existing investors.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

stock and Series A Warrants in this offering will be approximately $6.6 million,
based on an initial public offering price of $7.00 per unit, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. This does not include approximately $0.2 million of expenses that have
already been paid, and so will not affect use of proceeds. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
from this offering will be approximately $7.7 million.

We expect the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to fund our
operations for up to 12 months following the closing of the offering, including
the completion of our planned clinical trials and filing with the FDA for our
Group B Strep and Staph ID/R diagnostic tests. We intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering as follows:

(1) approximately $1.4 million in research and development expenses, including 
    $0.4 million for clinical development and regulatory filing of new 
    diagnostic tests, for Group B Strep and Staph ID/R;  

(2) approximately $1.4 million in sales and marketing expenses;  

(3) approximately $1.1 million to manufacture analyzers for customers;  

(4) approximately $0.2 million to begin to automate our manufacturing facility 
    and increase manufacturing capacity; and  

(5) the remaining proceeds, if any, will be used for general corporate purposes, 
    including working capital.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,

that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $113.6 million, based
upon the initial public offering price of $25.00 per share, after deducting

by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from us is
exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately
$131.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal reasons for this offering are to create a public market for shares
of our common stock and to facilitate our future access to public equity
markets. We have not quantified or allocated any specific portion of the net
proceeds or range of the net proceeds to any particular purpose. We anticipate
that we will use the net proceeds we receive from this offering, including any
net proceeds we receive from the exercise of the underwriters’ option to acquire
additional shares of common stock in this offering, for general corporate
purposes, including investing further in our sales and marketing and research
and development efforts and payment of anticipated general and administrative
expenses. We also intend to use proceeds from this offering to fund our growth
strategies described elsewhere in this prospectus. We may use a portion of the
net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses, technologies or other assets
that we believe are complementary to our own, although we have no agreements,
commitments or understandings with respect to any such transaction.

We also expect to use approximately $18.0 million of the net proceeds to repay
all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on our revolving line of
credit. We have used our revolving line of credit for general working capital
purposes. The interest rate on our revolving line of credit is the bank’s prime
rate plus 0.5%. The outstanding balance under our revolving line of credit is
due in March 2016.

The amount of what, and timing of when, we actually spend for these purposes may
vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future
revenue and cash generated by operations and the other factors. Accordingly, 
our management will have broad discretion in applying a portion of the net 
proceeds of this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the remaining
net proceeds in high quality, investment-grade instruments."

of 9,120,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting 
underwriting discounts, commissions and structuring fees. We intend to use 
these proceeds, together with the proceeds from borrowings of $100.0 million 
under our new term loan facility, as follows:

. to make a cash distribution to USD Group LLC of $98.0 million and to 
  reimburse USD Group LLC for $7.5 million of fees and expenses related to 
  this offering;

. to repay $97.8 million of indebtedness under USD’s current credit facility; 
  and

. to pay $2.0 million of fees and expenses in connection with our new senior 
  secured credit agreement, which will be comprised of a revolving credit 
  facility and a term loan.

The remaining approximately $39.7 million will be retained by us for general 
partnership purposes, including potentially to fund future acquisitions from 
USD and third parties and potentially for funding future growth projects, such 
as the potential acquisition from USD Group LLC of the Hardisty Phase II and 
Phase III projects on which we have been granted rights of first offer. USD 
has not offered these assets to us, and we are under no obligation to acquire 
these assets from USD with the proceeds of this offering, or otherwise. We do 
not presently have definitive agreements with USD or any third parties with 
respect to acquisitions. The consummation and timing of any future acquisitions 
of our right of first offer assets are subject to various contingencies, 
including USD’s successful development of such projects, USD’s willingness to
offer such projects for sale and obtain any necessary consents, our ability 
to negotiate acceptable purchase agreements and commercial agreements with 
respect to such acquisitions and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable 
terms. We may also consider the acquisition of other assets from USD and third 
parties. Any such acquisitions, however, will also depend on various 
contingencies, including our ability to identify attractive acquisition 
candidates and successfully negotiate acceptable acquisition agreements and 
our ability to obtain financing.

USD’s current credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable 
premium which equates to 3.90% as of June 30, 2014. An affiliate of an 
underwriter participating in this offering is a lender under the current USD 
credit facility and will receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering 
pursuant to the repayment of borrowings thereunder. In April 2014, our Canadian 
subsidiary which owns our Hardisty rail terminal borrowed $67.8 million under 
the current credit facility to fund the repayment of $67.0 million of 
intercompany indebtedness owed to USD.

The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option 
to purchase additional common units (approximately $17.4 million, if exercised 
in full, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and 
structuring fees) will be used to redeem from USD Group LLC a number of common 
units equal to the number of common units issued upon such exercise of the 
option at a price per unit equal to the net proceeds per common unit in this 
offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts, 
commissions and the structuring fee."

$7.5 million from the sale by us of 468,750 shares of our common stock in the
concurrent private placement, at the initial public offering price, for an
aggregate amount to be raised by us in this offering and the concurrent private
placement of $120.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
common stock, obtain additional capital, facilitate our future access to the
public equity markets and increase awareness of our company.

As of June 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.8 million and
received an additional $48.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of
our Series C convertible preferred stock in August 2014. We currently intend to
use the net proceeds we receive from this offering and the concurrent private
placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

.  approximately $50 million to fund external research and development expenses
   associated with the development of our Cimzia product candidate, net of 
   development milestone payments we expect to receive from our partner UCB 
   Pharma S.A.;

.  approximately $30 million to fund external research and development expenses
   associated with the development of our DRM04 product candidate;

.  approximately $15 million to fund external research and development expenses
   associated with the development of our DRM01 product candidate; and

.  the balance used to fund internal research and development expenses 
   associated with all of our product candidates, working capital, capital 
   expenditures and other general corporate purposes.

Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and 
the concurrent private placement to expand our current business by in-licensing 
or acquiring, as the case may be, commercial products, product candidates, 
technologies, compounds, other assets or complementary businesses, using cash 
or shares of our common stock. However, we have no current plans, commitments 
or obligations to do so.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be 
sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next
12 months, including for the initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials for Cimzia
and a Phase 2b clinical program for DRM01, and through the receipt of data from
our ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial for DRM04. This expected use of the net
proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. We cannot
specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds that we
will receive from this offering, or the amounts that we will actually spend on
the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend on numerous factors, including the ongoing status of and results from
clinical trials and other studies, as well as any strategic collaborations that
we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, any
in-licensing transactions or acquisitions, any unforeseen cash needs and the
performance of our investments.

We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds of this 
offering and the concurrent private placement and investors will be relying on
the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds.
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts,
certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government."

discretion, use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or 
investment in, businesses, products, services, or technologies that complement

sale of      common units in this offering, after deducting underwriting
discounts and structuring fees but before estimated offering expenses. We intend
to use these net proceeds as follows:

        º pay estimated offering expenses of approximately $2.0 million;

        º redeem 100% of our issued and outstanding Series D preferred units for
          approximately $42.4 million;

        º repay $195.6 million of the debt outstanding under our revolving
          credit facility; and

        º replenish approximately $17.1 million of working capital.

As of August 31, 2014, we had approximately $195.6 million of debt
outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Borrowings under our revolving
credit facility bear interest at 3.62% and are due on February 19, 2019. Our
outstanding indebtedness was incurred to primarily fund third party acquisitions
and for general partnership purposes.

Immediately following the repayment of a portion of the outstanding debt
under our revolving credit facility with a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering, we will borrow approximately $75.0 million thereunder. We will use the
proceeds from that borrowing to replenish our working capital.

Prior to the closing of this offering, we will distribute approximately
$92.1 million of accounts receivable that comprise our gross working capital to
our existing partners, pro rata in accordance with their ownership interest in
us.

The net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to
purchase additional common units will be used to redeem a number of common units
from our existing partners, pro rata, equal to the number of common units issued
upon exercise of the option at a price per common unit equal to the net proceeds
per common unit in this offering before expenses but after deducting
underwriting discounts and the structuring fee. Accordingly, any exercise of the
underwriters' option will not affect the total number of units outstanding or
the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all
units.

Affiliates of Barclays Capital Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. and BMO
Capital Markets Corp. are lenders under our revolving credit facility and,
accordingly, will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering. The
underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform
services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business."

share that we will receive net proceeds from this offering, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions (including commissions payable in 
respect of the sale of ordinary shares by the selling shareholder, estimated 
at $3.9 million, or $5.0 million if the underwriters exercise their option to 
purchase 1,500,000 additional ordinary shares from the selling shareholder) 
and estimated offering expenses (including fees payable to Bain Capital 
Partners, LLC) payable by us, of approximately $29.5 million (or $28.4 million 
if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ordinary 
shares from the selling shareholder). We will not receive any proceeds from 
the sale of our ordinary shares by the selling shareholder, including any 
ordinary shares sold by the selling shareholder in connection with the exercise
of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ordinary shares.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from the sale of ordinary shares in 
this offering, together with cash on hand, to repay the entire $31.4 million 
(at the exchange rate prevailing as of June 30, 2014) outstanding amount due 
under our Vendor Loan Note as of June 30, 2014 and to pay fees and expenses 
incurred in connection with this offering. We will use any remaining net 
proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes. We expect that the 
selling shareholder will use $67.7 million of the net proceeds received by it 
in this offering to repay a portion of its outstanding PIK Notes due 2020."

  (1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their   
      shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
      combination.                                                                

  (2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
      proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this   
      prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out 
      of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
      of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that 
      offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts   
      will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.                     
 
  (3) Deferred underwriting commissions and other fees equal to an aggregate of   
      3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering will be placed into the trust   
      account at the closing of this offering. The underwriters have agreed to    
      reimburse us for a portion of our expenses in this offering. Any amounts so 
      reimbursed will be held outside the trust account. Upon completion of our   
      initial business combination, up to $8,400,000, comprised of (a) $5,760,000 
      (or $6,624,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in   
      full) payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting discounts and   
      commissions and (b) $2,640,000 (or $3,036,000 if the underwriters’          
      over-allotment option is exercised in full) payable to RCS Capital, or RCS, 
      a division of Realty Capital Securities, LLC, or RCS LLC, an entity that is 
      under common control with our sponsor, for financial advisory services in   
      connection with the identification, evaluation, negotiation and completion  
      of our initial business combination, will be paid to the underwriters and   
      RCS, as applicable. The remaining funds will be released to us and can be   
      used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or       
      businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
      corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on           
      indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,  
      to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The        
      underwriters and RCS will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the    
      deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and the advisory fees,      
      respectively.                                                               

  (4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
      of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
      we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
      estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business       
      combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
      In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific        
      industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses  
      associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal     
      counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may   
      engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due       
      diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
      other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
      which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
      specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.     

  (5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
      business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
      financing.                                                                  

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, approximately $240,000,000 (or approximately $276,000,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$8,400,000 (or up to $9,660,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions and other fees, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $24,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.01% per year.
Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax obligations, the
proceeds from this offering will not be released from the trust account until
the earlier of (a) the completion of our initial business combination or (b) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that the
interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to
pay Delaware franchise taxes for 2014. The net proceeds held in the trust
account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business
with which we ultimately complete our business combination. If our initial
business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or not all of
the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the
consideration in connection with our business combination, we may apply the
balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.

However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We have entered into an agreement to pay RCS Advisory Services, LLC, an entity
under common control with our sponsor, a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services commencing on
the date our securities are first listed on NASDAQ. We expect to enter into an
agreement to pay our sponsor an amount not to exceed $15,000 per month as
reimbursement for a portion of the compensation paid to its personnel, including
certain of our officers, who work on our behalf, commencing on the date our
securities are first listed on NASDAQ. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. In
addition, we expect to enter into an agreement with RCS Capital, or RCS, a
division of Realty Capital Securities, LLC, or RCS LLC, an entity under common
control with our sponsor, to act as a financial advisor in connection with our
identification, negotiation and consummation of a business combination. In
exchange for these services, the agreement provides that we will pay RCS a
transaction fee equal to 1.1% of the total gross proceeds raised in this
offering. The transaction fee will be payable upon consummation of a business
combination out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. The
agreement also provides that we will reimburse RCS for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, irrespective of whether we consummate a business combination.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of January 1,
2015 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or 
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business 
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, and then only in
connection with those shares of our common stock that such stockholder properly
elected to redeem, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our business combination within 24 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements)
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

in this offering will be approximately $65.6 million, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our available
cash resources, increase awareness of our company in the marketplace and create
a public market for our common stock.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the net
proceeds from this offering to us will be approximately $69.1 million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common stock by the
selling stockholders pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares, although we will bear the costs, other than the underwriting discounts
and commissions, associated with the sale of these shares.

We intend to use the net proceeds to repay approximately $14.6 million of
outstanding indebtedness, consisting of the outstanding balance of approximately
$13.1 million on our revolving line of credit and an outstanding balance of
approximately $1.5 million on a term loan that we assumed and refinanced in
connection with the BHR Acquisition. We also intend to use $7.3 million of the
net proceeds from this offering to pay the amount owed in connection with the
settlement of certain litigation as described in the section entitled
“Business—Legal Proceedings.” We intend to use the remaining approximately $43.7
million of net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, which may include the financing of future potential acquisitions and
de novo facility developments, although we have no current specific plans for
the remaining portion of the net proceeds as of the date of this prospectus.

The amounts and timing of the use of the remaining approximately $43.7 million
of net proceeds will vary depending on the amount of cash generated by our
operations, competitive and industry developments, market opportunities and the
rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, we will have significant
discretion and flexibility in applying the remaining portion of the net
proceeds. Pending the above uses, we plan to invest the remaining net proceeds
that we receive in this offering in short-term and intermediate-term
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade investments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

As of June 30, 2014, the interest rate on our revolving line of credit, which is
available for general corporate purposes and matures on April 1, 2015, was
3.15%. As of June 30, 2014, the interest rate under the term loan, which matures
on April 15, 2015, was 5.0%. The original proceeds from the term loan were used
to repay a loan of a BHR subsidiary, Greenhouse Real Estate, LLC."

stock in this offering will be approximately $71.7 million at the initial public
offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
will be approximately $82.9 million after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

    •   approximately $25.0 to $35.0 million to further the clinical development
        of CB-839 through completion of Phase 2 clinical trials;                      

    •   approximately $10.0 to $15.0 million to further the development of our     
        arginase inhibitor program through a Phase 1 clinical trial;               

    •   approximately $5.0 to $10.0 million to fund our research and drug 
        discovery activities related to additional product candidates, including
        the advancement of a third program to submission of an Investigational 
        New Drug application; and                                                           

  •   the remaining proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process,
it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds
from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. Our management will
have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering. The
amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors
including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and
success of preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical
trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions and
the amount of cash obtained through future collaborations, if any.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies,
medicines or technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may
use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing investment-grade securities or
government securities."

will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $502.2 million
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

We intend to (i) use the net proceeds received from this offering to redeem a
significant portion of our outstanding Subordinated Notes and approximately
$2.5 million of accrued and unpaid interest on such Subordinated Notes (assuming
a redemption date of October 17, 2014) and (ii) if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional shares from us, any additional net proceeds
from this offering first to redeem any remaining Subordinated Notes, then to
repay borrowings under our multi-currency revolving loan facility and then to
repay borrowings under our A/R Facility.

On September 17, 2014, we issued a conditional notice of redemption to the
holders of the Subordinated Notes notifying such holders that, subject to the
completion of this offering, we will use the net proceeds from this offering to
redeem a significant portion of the Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of
100.0% plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption. As of
June 30, 2014, $532.4 million in aggregate principal amount of Subordinated
Notes were outstanding, including €126.9 million of Subordinated Notes
denominated in euros (or $173.7 million on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis as of
June 30, 2014 using an exchange rate $1.3690 = €1.00). The Subordinated Notes
mature on June 30, 2017 and have an interest rate of 10.75% per annum. 

As of June 30, 2014, we had an aggregate of $9.6 million of outstanding
borrowings under our multi-currency revolving loan facility. This facility will
mature on April 3, 2016 and, as of June 30, 2014, the weighted average interest
rate applicable to outstanding borrowings under such facility was 6.00%. See
“Description of Certain Indebtedness—Senior Credit Facility.”

As of June 30, 2014, we had $137.4 million of outstanding borrowings, $11.3
million of undrawn letters of credit outstanding and no additional borrowing
capacity under the A/R Facility. This facility will terminate on November 4,
2016 and, as of June 30, 2014, the interest rate applicable to outstanding
borrowings under such facility was 1.65%. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest
the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.

An affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co., as the holder of approximately 83% of our
Subordinated Notes, will receive approximately 83% of the net proceeds from this
offering that are used to redeem our Subordinated Notes. Affiliates of Merrill 
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan 
Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Citigroup

We will not receive any of the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our
Class A common stock in this offering by the selling stockholders.

The principal reasons for this offering are to create a public market for
our Class A common stock and thereby facilitate access to the public equity
markets, increase our visibility in the marketplace, as well as to obtain
additional capital. We expect to distribute a portion of the net proceeds to our
existing Series A preferred stockholders upon conversion to common stock in
connection with the completion of this offering to satisfy the remaining portion
of an accrued cash dividend, which amount was approximately $20.9 million as of
June 30, 2014, or approximately 7.4% of the net proceeds, based on the initial
offering price of $29.00 per share. Our co-founders and certain of our
directors, executive officers and holders of more than 5% of our voting
securities hold 85% of our outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock and,
as a result of their ownership, will receive 85% of the dividend payment, or
approximately $17.8 million as of June 30, 2014. We also expect to distribute a
portion of the net proceeds to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding and
remittance obligations related to the settlement of outstanding restricted stock
units upon the completion of this offering, which amount was approximately
$15.3 million as of June 30, 2014. While we have no current specific plan for
the remaining net proceeds to us from this offering, we intend to use the
remaining net proceeds to us for working capital and other general corporate
purposes. In addition, we may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds
to us for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or
businesses that complement our business.

proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

SmooFi will pay all costs related to this offering. If the amount of offering
costs exceed the amount raised, this amount in excess of the offering proceeds
will be paid when necessary or otherwise accrued on the books and records of
SmooFi until we are able to pay the full amounts due either from revenues or
loans from our president and chief executive officer, related or unrelated
parties that we may approach. A significant portion of the estimated costs of
the offering ($55,000) are legal fees and expenses ($40,000). Absent sufficient
revenues to pay these amounts, we will seek financial assistance either from our
president and chief executive officer, or shareholders or possibly third party
business associates of our president and chief executive officer who may agree
to loan us the funds necessary to cover the balance of outstanding professional
and related fees related to our prospectus to the extent that such liabilities
cannot be extended or satisfied in other ways and the professional service
providers insist upon payment. Absent the above, Mr. Clarke will attempt to seek
sufficient funding personally for the amounts due and, if successful in
obtaining these funds, to lend it to the Company on an interest-free basis. No
formal written arrangement exists, with respect to Mr. Clarke or anyone’s
commitment outside of the Company, to loan funds for this purpose.

Our plans will not change regardless of whether the maximum proceeds are raised."

from our sale of the 20,600,000 shares of common stock offered by us in this 
offering, based upon the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share and 
after deducting $20.2 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses of $8.8 million to be paid by us.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common stock by the 
selling stockholder pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares, although we will bear the costs, other than the underwriting discounts 
and commissions, associated with the sale of these shares.

Approximately $58.8 million of the net proceeds received by us from this
offering will be used to repay revolver borrowings incurred under revolving 
lines of credit with Vivint. We plan to use the remaining net proceeds that we 
receive in this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. We 
may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire, license and invest in 
complementary products, technologies or businesses; however, we currently have 
no agreements or commitments to complete any such transaction.

As of June 30, 2014, we had an aggregate of $57.3 million in debt outstanding 
under the revolving lines of credit referred to above, which we incurred for 
working capital purposes. Such borrowings currently accrue interest at a rate 
of 7.5% or 12% per year and mature on January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2017 
respectively, unless, in each case, the maturity is accelerated as a result of 
a change of control or an event of default.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
that we receive in this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the treatment of these proceeds. Pending the uses 
described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive in this 
offering in short-term and intermediate-term investment-grade interest-bearing 
securities, such as certificates of deposit, commercial paper, money market 
accounts or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

ordinary shares will be approximately $34.4 million, or approximately
$40.0 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
ordinary shares in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a
public market for our ordinary shares. We expect to use the net proceeds from
this offering as follows:
 
   •   approximately $20.0 million to fund clinical development costs of VB-111 
       in rGBM;                                                                      

   •   approximately $1.5 million to fund clinical development costs of VB-111 
       in other indications;                                                         
   •   approximately $3.8 million to fund development costs of VB-201;

   •   approximately $1.0 million for pre-clinical development of follow-on       
       Lecinoxoid product candidates;                                             

   •   approximately $0.3 million, representing 1% of the net proceeds of this    
       offering, to satisfy a payment obligation triggered upon our initial 
       public offering pursuant to an agreement with Tel Hashomer—Medical 
       Research,Infrastructure and Services Ltd.; and                                      

   •   the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, 
       including funding the costs of operating as a public company.                        

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, we estimate that such
funds will be sufficient to enable us to receive interim data from our planned
Phase 3 clinical trial of VB-111 in rGBM, to complete our Phase 2 clinical trial
for VB-111 in thyroid cancer, to complete our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for
VB-111 in ovarian cancer and to complete our Phase 2 clinical trials for VB-201
in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our research and
development efforts, the progress of our clinical trials, our operating costs
and capital expenditures and the other factors. Accordingly, we will retain the discretion to allocate the net
proceeds of this offering, and we reserve the right to change the allocation of
the net proceeds among the uses described above.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from the offering in
investment- grade, interest-bearing instruments, securities or certificates of
deposit."

1)    A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
       FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
       portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we        
       received from the sponsor. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of 
       this offering available to us.                                               

(2)    No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the 
       private units.                                                               

(3)    Our counsel has agreed to defer legal fees for services provided in          
       connection with the offering in the amount of $100,000. Such deferred legal  
       fees will be payable by us only upon the successful completion of our initial
       business combination. In the event we do not consummate our initial business 
       combination the deferred legal fee will not be paid. Accordingly, the        
       deferred legal fee is not reflected as a cost of this offering in the above  
       “Estimated Offering Expenses” 

(4)    Upon closing of the initial business combination, the funds held in the trust
       account may, but need not, be used to pay our expenses relating to acquiring 
       a target business, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital in an amount  
       equal to 4.0% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering described   
       below.                                                                       

(5)    Does not include any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account  
       that may be available to us as described in this prospectus.                 

A total of $61,200,000 (or $70,380,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private units and the sponsor warrants described in this prospectus will
be placed in a trust account in the United States at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and
will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S.
Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may be released to us (net of
taxes payable) to fund our working capital requirements, as discussed below,
none of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust
account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering and (ii) a
redemption to public shareholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the event
we do not consummate our initial business combination within the applicable
period.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income that
may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to
pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target
business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake
in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant
prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of
intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial
business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking
in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less
than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available
to use from the trust account is minimal as a result of the current interest
rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the Nasdaq
Capital Market, we have agreed to pay our sponsor, an entity controlled by Ms.
Winnie Lai Ling Ng, a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative services. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced to us a total of
$175,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These
advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due on demand.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per
unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000
ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 rights
included in the private units would result in the issuance of 5,000 ordinary
shares upon the closing of our business combination, as well as 50,000 warrants
to purchase 25,000 shares).

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate our initial business combination within 18 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances
will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account.

Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination. Our initial shareholders have
also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any public shares
purchased during or after the offering in connection with the consummation of
our initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have
agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions with respect to its
founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within
18 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial
shareholders acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares
if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required
time period."

common stock by us in this offering will be approximately $146.1 million 
(or $168.1 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares of Class A common stock), after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions but before other offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering (excluding any net 
proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional
shares of Class A common stock) to purchase 10,476,190 common units directly
from Neff Holdings at a price per unit equal to the initial public offering
price per share of Class A common stock in this offering less the underwriting
discounts and commissions. We will use all net proceeds, if any, received upon
exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A
common stock to purchase additional common units directly from Neff Holdings at
the same price per unit.

Neff Holdings anticipates that it will use the $146.1 million in net proceeds 
it receives from the sale of common units to Neff Corporation (together with 
any additional proceeds it may receive if the underwriters exercise their 
option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) as follows:

.  first, to repay $40.0 million of borrowings under our Revolving Credit
   Facility (the Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature in November 
   2018 and had an interest rate of approximately 2.8% as of September 30, 
   2014);

.  second, to pay the approximately $5.3 million of other fees and expenses 
   (other than underwriting discounts and commissions) related to this 
   offering; and

.  third, to prepay a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Second
   Lien Loan (approximately $96.0 million in principal amount plus $4.8 million
   of prepayment premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses). The 
   Second Lien Loan is scheduled to mature in June 2021 and had an interest 
   rate of approximately 7.25% as of September 30, 2014.

In addition, if the gross proceeds to us from this offering exceed $175.0 
million following the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 
additional shares of Class A common stock, payments aggregating $9.9 million
will be made to certain management and non-employee members of the board of
directors in connection with this offering with such additional proceeds
pursuant to Neff Holdings' transaction bonus plan.

Upon prepayment of approximately $96.0 million of the Second Lien Loan and
repayment of approximately $40.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, we
will recognize a loss of approximately $0.5 million in the quarter during which
such prepayments occur.

Certain affiliates of the underwriters hold a portion of the indebtedness
being repaid with a portion of the proceeds of this offering as described above.

On June 9, 2014, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility and borrowed the
Second Lien Loan in connection with the refinancing of our Senior Secured Notes.
The net proceeds of the Second Lien Loan were used to (1) prepay the Senior 
Secured Notes in full, together with a prepayment premium and accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with such 
refinancing and the amendment of our Revolving Credit Facility, and (2) make a 
$354.4 million distribution to the members of Neff Holdings and to make payments
to certain management and independent members of the board of directors."

from the sale of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock in this offering at an
initial public offering price of $9.00 per share after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. In November 2014, we entered into a Restructure Agreement with EPR
providing for the prepayment of a portion of our outstanding debt, as described
below.

More specifically, we intend to use approximately $42.9 million of the net
proceeds from this offering for repayment of a portion of the outstanding debt
relating to the development of our Mount Snow ski area. On April 4, 2007, we and
our subsidiary Mount Snow, Ltd., as borrowers, entered into a promissory note in
favor of EPT Mount Snow, Inc., as lender, in the amount of $25.0 million, which
was later modified by the Modification Agreement dated as of April 1, 2010 to
increase the amount of funds available under such loan to $41.0 million (the
""Development Loan""). The outstanding balance under the Development Loan accrues
interest at a rate of 10.00% annually and matures on April 1, 2016.

We intend to use approximately $12.5 million of the net proceeds for
repayment of a portion of the outstanding debt relating to our acquisition of
the Attitash ski area. On April 4, 2007, we and our subsidiary, L.B.O.
Holding, Inc., as borrowers, entered into a promissory note in favor of EPT
Mount Attitash, Inc., as lender, in the amount of $15.7 million. As of July 31,
2014, the outstanding balance under this promissory note accrues interest at a
rate of 10.93% and matures on April 3, 2027.

We intend to use approximately $11.4 million of the net proceeds for
repayment of a portion of the outstanding debt incurred principally to pay off
debt secured by Crotched Mountain, of which approximately $0.4 million will be
used to acquire the portion of the land underlying Crotched Mountain that we
lease. On March 10, 2006, our subsidiary SNH Development, Inc., as borrower,
entered into a promissory note in favor of EPT Crotched Mountain, Inc., as
lender, in the amount of $8.0 million, which was amended on July 13, 2012 to
increase the funds available to approximately $11.0 million. As of July 31,
2014, the outstanding balance under this promissory note accrues interest at a
rate of 10.27% and matures on March 10, 2027.

We intend to use approximately $9.5 million of the net proceeds to repay a
portion of the outstanding debt due pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit
and Security Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2007, among the Company and
certain of its affiliates, as borrowers, and EPT Ski Properties, Inc., as
lender. On October 30, 2007, the borrowers entered into a promissory note in
favor of EPT Ski Properties, Inc. in the amount of $31.0 million, which was
later modified to increase the amount available under the Amended and Restated
Credit and Security Agreement to approximately $56.0 million. As of July 31,
2014, the outstanding balance under this promissory note accrues interest at a
rate of 9.98% and is due on October 29, 2027.

Pursuant to the terms of the Debt Restructure, we intend to use up to
$5.0 million of the offering proceeds to pay a defeasance fee to EPR in
connection with our debt prepayment.

The remaining proceeds will be used for working capital and general
corporate purposes, including future acquisitions.

Pending these uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds in a variety of
capital preservation instruments, including short-term, interest bearing
investment grade securities. The goal with respect to the investment of these
net proceeds is capital preservation and liquidity so that such funds are
readily available."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $57.5 million, based on the 
initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we 
estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $66.6 million, 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use approximately $37.5 million of the net proceeds from 
this offering to conduct and advance our U.S. Phase 3 clinical trials to 
support the registration of LIPO-202 for the reduction of central abdominal 
bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients and other supplemental 
studies of LIPO-202 as follows:

. approximately $0.8 million to fund our LIPO-202-CL-12 clinical trial to 
  support registration;

. approximately $11.0 million to fund our LIPO-202-CL-18 clinical pivotal 
  trial;

. approximately $11.0 million to fund our LIPO-202-CL-19 clinical pivotal 
  trial;

. approximately $3.6 million to fund our LIPO-202-CL-21 clinical trial to 
  support registration;

. approximately $5.6 million to fund our LIPO-202-CL-22 clinical trial to 
  support registration;

. approximately $4.0 million to fund our LIPO-202-CL-23 clinical trial to 
  support registration;

. approximately $1.0 million to fund our LIPO-202-CL-25 clinical supplemental 
  trial; and

. approximately $0.5 million to fund our LIPO-202-CL-26 clinical supplemental 
  trial.

We currently expect that the net proceeds from this offering will enable us to 
complete each of our planned Phase 3 clinical trials. We will use the balance 
of the net proceeds for the further development of LIPO-202 for the reduction 
of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients, 
including preparations for our potential submission to the FDA of an NDA filing 
for LIPO-202, which we expect to file in the second half of 2016 if our 
clinical trials are successful, as well as for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes.

We may use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire complementary products, 
technologies, or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or 
commitments to complete any such transaction and are not involved in 
negotiations to do so. Other than as set forth above, we have not yet 
identified the amounts we plan to spend on each of these areas or the timing 
of the expenditures. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be 
based on many factors, including research and development costs, cash flows 
from operations and the anticipated growth of our business. Accordingly, our 
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, 
and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the 
application of the proceeds in this offering. The amounts that we actually 
spend for the purposes described above may vary significantly and will depend, 
in part, on the timing and amount of our future revenue, our future expenses, 
and any future acquisitions that we may propose.

Pending these uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in 
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade securities. We cannot predict 
whether the net proceeds will yield a favorable return."

this offering will be approximately $79.9 million after deducting estimated

by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in
full, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately
$92.4 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to directly and indirectly
purchase LLC Units from The Habit Restaurants, LLC, as described below. The
Habit Restaurants, LLC will subsequently use such proceeds to repay all of the
borrowings under our existing credit facility with California Bank & Trust
(which was $11.1 million as of September 30, 2014), and to repay approximately
$30 million to extinguish the Bridge Loan with California Bank & Trust in
connection with the distribution to the members of The Habit Restaurants, LLC
made immediately prior to the completion of this offering. The Habit
Restaurants, LLC will use the remaining proceeds of approximately $38.8 million
to continue to support our growth and for working capital and general corporate
purposes.

As of September 30, 2014, we had $11.1 million outstanding under the credit
facility at an interest rate of 2.48%. We entered into our credit facility,
which expires on July 23, 2017, with California Bank & Trust on July 23, 2014.
The credit facility provides for up to $35.0 million in borrowing capacity to
fund the development of new restaurants with borrowings limited to the lesser of
50% or $500,000 of the cost of each new restaurant. 

In connection with the completion of this offering, The Habit Restaurants, Inc.
intends to purchase, directly or indirectly, LLC Units from The Habit
Restaurants, LLC at a purchase price per unit equal to the initial public
offering price per share of Class A common stock in this offering net of
underwriting discounts. The effect of the purchase of LLC Units by the Habit
Restaurants, Inc. and its subsidiaries is to dilute the ownership interest of
the other existing holders in The Habit Restaurants, LLC and proportionately
increase our direct and indirect ownership interest in The Habit Restaurants,
LLC. The Habit Restaurants, Inc. will purchase, directly and indirectly, from
The Habit Restaurants, LLC 5,000,000 LLC Units for an aggregate of $79.9 million
(or 5,750,000 LLC Units for an aggregate of $92.4 million if the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common
stock). The Habit Restaurants, LLC will bear the cost of or reimburse The Habit

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional financing,
to create a public market for our ordinary shares, which would enhance our
overall company profile, to facilitate our future access to the public equity
markets and to recruit and retain high-quality management and operating
personnel. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general
corporate purposes focused on growing our business and supporting the
development and growth of Cnova. The proceeds will help to accelerate our
strategy, in particular enhancement of our direct sales business and
marketplaces globally, continued innovation in fulfillment infrastructure,
expansion of our international footprint with planned businesses in new
geographies and launch of new specialty websites to help us capture a wider
demographic. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to reduce leverage
from self-financing receivables generated by payment-in-installment programs in
Brazil and to fund investments in and acquisitions of complementary businesses,
assets and technologies that may arise. However, we do not currently have
specific plans or commitments with respect to the net proceeds from this

in this offering, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
the estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately 
$31,500,000, (approximately $36,225,000, if the over-allotment option granted 
to the underwriter is exercised in full).

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $29,336,868 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, our underwriter’s 
accountable expense allowance, of not more than $200,000 and other estimated 
expenses of the offering payable by the company of approximately $703,132, 
which includes legal, accounting, printing costs and various fees associated 
with the registration and listing of our shares. If the underwriter exercises 
its right to purchase an additional 525,000 shares of common stock to cover 
over-allotments, we will receive net proceeds of approximately $33,872,868, 
after deducting $1,449,000 for underwriting discounts and commissions.

We expect to utilize these funds over the next 18 to 24 months approximately 
as follows:

. $2.0 to $4.0 million to increase sales and marketing activities over the 
  next two years to increase sales coverage and market penetration.

. $4.0 million to increase development and clinical efforts to enhance the 
  external hardware and software of the Argus II System.  If successful, these 
  enhancements could improve the resolution and other performance 
  characteristics of our system.

. $2.0 million to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and benefit 
  of using the Argus II system to treat patients with AMD.  We will start with 
  a feasibility trial in late 2014.  With promising results, we will begin a 
  larger scale efficacy trial in early 2016 that could lead to marketing 
  approval for the Argus II system for AMD patients in 2019.  We estimate that 
  the cost to complete this additional trial would be approximately $4.5 
  million.

. $5.0 million to conduct pre-clinical development of the Orion I cortical 
  implant.  If successful, we will begin testing our Orion I technology in 
  humans in late 2016.  The human clinical testing is likely to take the form 
  of a feasibility study followed by a premarket approval pivotal trial. The 
  details of these trials will be determined collaboratively with the FDA at 
  that time.  We cannot accurately estimate the timing or exact cost of these 
  trials at this time.

No assurances can be given that our development activities or clinical trials 
will result in a marketable product or that we will be successful in raising 
adequate funds to support our future development and marketing activities. To 
the extent we are able to raise funds, it may be on terms that will result in 
unfavorable dilution to our shareholders.

We intend to obtain these additional funds through a combination of one of 
more of the following:

. Cash flows from operations. 

. Sales of our securities. 

. Joint ventures. 

. Research grants. 

. Issuances of debt.

We intend to use the balance of net proceeds for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. Our management will have broad discretion in the 
application of the net proceeds, from this offering and investors will be 
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the 
proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use 
portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes. Circumstances 
that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds and the alternate 
purposes for which the proceeds may be used include:

. the existence of unforeseen or other opportunities or the need to take 
  advantage of changes in timing of our existing activities;

. the need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase, reduce or eliminate 
  one or more existing initiatives due to, among other things, changing 
  regulations, changing market conditions and competitive developments or 
  interim results of research and development efforts;

. results from our business development and marketing efforts; 

. the effect of foreign, federal, state, and local regulation; 

. our ability to continue attracting grant or other development funding; 
  and/or

. the presentation of strategic opportunities of which we are not currently 
  aware (including acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and other similar 
  transactions).

From time to time, we may evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate 
continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of 
resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being optimized.

The other principal purposes of this offering are to:

. increase our visibility in the markets we serve; 

. strengthen our balance sheet; 

. create a public market for our common stock; 

. facilitate our future access to the public capital markets; 

. provide liquidity for existing stockholders; and 

. improve the effectiveness of our equity compensation plans in attracting and 
  retaining key employees.

Pending uses as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from 
this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such 
as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and 
guaranteed obligations of the US government as well as bank demand deposits."

(1) The loan has two one-year extension options to extend the maturity date  
    to 5/1/2018.

We expect to use any remaining net proceeds, including any proceeds from the
exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, for general working capital
purposes, capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions. Pending the
application of the net proceeds, we will invest the net proceeds in
interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing securities in a
manner that is consistent with our qualification as a REIT."

common stock we are offering will be approximately $473.7 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering
expenses. If the underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional
shares, we estimate the net proceeds to us will be approximately $545.5 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. $198 million to repay amounts outstanding under our new unsecured, variable-
  rate revolving credit facility, which is used to temporarily fund our real 
  estate acquisitions; 

. $125,000 to redeem all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock 
  plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon; and 

. the remainder to fund property acquisitions subject to purchase contracts in 
  the ordinary course of our business.

Our credit facility has a current maximum availability of $300 million,
expires in September 2017 and bears interest at a rate equal to either one-month
LIBOR plus a leverage-based credit spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.50%, or a Base
Rate, as defined in the debt agreement, plus a leverage-based credit spread
ranging from 0.75% to 1.50%. As of October 17, 2014, there was $198 million
outstanding under our credit facility.

Pending the permanent use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend
to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing, short-term investment-grade
securities, money-market accounts or other investments that are consistent with
our intention to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes."

approximately US$102.8 million, or approximately US$119.5 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by
us. In addition, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately
US$50.0 million from the concurrent private placement.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement as follows:

. approximately US$120 million to expand our fleet; 

. approximately US$20 million to expand our service network; and 

. the remainder for general corporate purposes, including working capital and 
  funding potential acquisition of complementary businesses, although we are 
  not currently negotiating any such transactions.

The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and allocate the net
proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement based upon our
present plans and business conditions. Our management, however, will have
significant flexibility and discretion to apply the net proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement differently than as described in this prospectus.

Pending any use of the net proceeds as described above, we plan to invest
the net proceeds we receive from this offering and the concurrent private
placement in short-term debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement, as an offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiaries or make additional capital contributions to our PRC
subsidiaries to fund their respective capital expenditures or working capital.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

proceeds from the concurrent private placement, will be approximately $131.8
million, based on the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. Our proceeds from the sale of the common stock sold in the
concurrent private placement will be $20 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock and thereby facilitate access to the public equity markets,
increase our visibility in the marketplace and obtain additional capital. We
believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term
investments and payments due under our license and collaboration agreements will
be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure
needs for at least the next 12 months. Additionally, if roxadustat is successful
in further clinical development, based on our current development plans,
expected payments under our existing license and collaboration agreements may be
sufficient to fund our development of roxadustat through commercialization. We
intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement to commercialize our unpartnered product candidates
such as FG-3019, corneal implants and other HIF-PH inhibitors, as well as for
general corporate purposes. These uses include meeting any short term liquidity
needs pending receipt of amounts due or subject to reimbursement under our
license and collaboration agreements. If the development cost of roxadustat were
to exceed our expectations and not be funded by our collaboration partners, or
collaboration receipts were less than we anticipate, or if a portion of our
existing cash and cash equivalents are used to develop other product candidates,
we may use a more substantial portion of the net proceeds from this offering and
the concurrent private placement to fund our roxadustat development costs
through commercialization. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to
acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies, although we have no
present commitments or agreements for any specific acquisitions. Accordingly, we
will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this offering
and the concurrent private placement. Pending these uses, we plan to invest
these net proceeds in short-term and long-term interest bearing obligations,
investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the United States.

We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement."

     the assumed Fund D term loan had a principal balance of $64,158,706, bore
     interest at a LIBOR based rate, which as of October 13, 2014, was 3.15% and
     will mature May 2018. Borrowings under the secured debt facilities were
     used by Fund A and Fund D to acquire real property interests that will be
     contributed to us in connection with the closing of this offering. The
     secured debt facilities will be amended and restated as a new revolving
     credit facility.

(2)  Following the closing of this offering, Fund A and Fund D will make a
     further liquidating distribution to their respective members, including
     Landmark.

(3)  Repayment of amounts under the new secured revolving credit facility may be
     lower due to amortization of existing principal balances, resulting in a
     decrease in the repayment of the new secured revolving credit facility and
     an increase in the distribution to Fund A and Fund D.

The net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to
purchase additional common units will be used to redeem from the Contributing
Landmark Funds, a number of common units equal to the number of common units
issued upon exercise of the option at a price per common unit equal to the net
proceeds per common unit in this offering before expenses but after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the structuring fee. Accordingly, any
exercise of the underwriters' option will not affect the total number of units
outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly
distribution on all units."

$39.5 million, or approximately $45.7 million if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional ordinary shares.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds as follows:

• approximately $16 million with respect to our ND0612H product candidate 
  through completion of a bioequivalence study in Europe and the initiation 
  of phase III clinical trials in the United States in the first half of 2016; 

• approximately $18 million with respect to our ND0612L product candidate 
  through the commencement of our two pivotal phase III clinical trials in 
  2015 in the United States and Europe to support an NDA submission to the 
  FDA (but not to fund the completion of such clinical trials or receipt of 
  marketing approval); and 

• approximately $1 million to $2 million to advance the development of our 
  other product candidates. 

We expect to use the balance of the net proceeds for working capital and general
corporate purposes.

The above estimates and dates may change based on the results of our clinical
trials and the regulatory approval process. 

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management retains broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering. Our management will have significant flexibility in applying
the net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing investment-grade securities or deposits."

VX Employee Holdings, LLC, a Virgin America employee ownership vehicle that we
consolidate for financial reporting purposes, will sell 231,210 issued and

approximately $5.3 million of gross proceeds received by VX Employee Holdings,

In accordance with the 2014 Recapitalization Agreement, we will retain
approximately $220.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of 13,106,377 shares

general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing
activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures,

prior to September 30, 2014). Pending these uses, we intend to invest these net
proceeds in high-quality, short-term obligations. Currently, we do not yet know
the amounts that we intend to use for each of these general corporate
activities. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion over the uses
of these net proceeds in this offering. We cannot predict whether the proceeds
invested will yield a favorable return.

In connection with the PAR Capital Private Placement, out of our approximately
$220.0 million of retained net proceeds mentioned above, we have agreed to pay
to the Virgin Group and Cyrus Holdings an aggregate amount of approximately
$2.1 million, the aggregate discount to the initial public offering price of the
shares purchased by PAR Capital from the Virgin Group and Cyrus Holdings, and a
private placement commission of approximately $1.17 million to Barclays Capital
Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. We also intend to use a portion of our
net proceeds to pay withholding taxes on the 218,550 shares of common stock to
be issued to certain executive officers and management upon completion of this
offering and a portion of our net proceeds for amounts that we have agreed to
pay certain of our aircraft lessors in settlement of accelerated lease
obligations.

offering will be approximately $286.5 million, after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to redeem $150.0 million
aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes for an amount equal to 109.5% of
their face value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
redemption date, to repay approximately $108.6 million of borrowings under the
Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and for general corporate purposes.

As of September 30, 2014, the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes
outstanding was $375.0 million, excluding accrued and unpaid interest of
$17.8 million. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum and
mature on October 1, 2023. On or prior to October 1, 2016, under certain
circumstances, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Notes at a redemption price of 109.5% of their principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date using the
proceeds of certain equity offerings, including this initial public offering of
our common stock. On or prior to October 1, 2018, we may redeem the Senior
Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date plus a
make-whole premium as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes.
Thereafter, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at redemption
prices specified in the indenture. On November 3, 2014 we delivered a redemption
notice to holders of the Senior Notes pursuant to which we expect to redeem
$150.0 million of the notes upon consummation of this offering.

The Senior Secured Term Loan Facility under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities
had $881.1 million outstanding as of September 30, 2014 with a maturity date on
September 23, 2020. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and
the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to,
at PRA Holdings' option, either (a) LIBOR for the relevant interest period, plus
3.50% per annum; provided that solely with respect to the Senior Secured Term
Loan Facility LIBOR shall be deemed to be no less than 1.00% per annum or (b) a
base rate, plus 2.50% per annum; provided that solely with respect to the Senior
Secured Term Loan Facility the base rate shall be deemed to be no less than
2.00% per annum. We may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Senior
Secured Term Loan Facility without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursements
of the lenders' redeployment costs in the case of a prepayment of LIBOR
borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period. As of
September 30, 2014, the interest applicable on the Senior Secured Term Loan
Facility was 4.5%.

In the event the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares, we expect to use net proceeds from the sale of such shares to repay
additional borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan.

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the proceeds

. US$10.0 million for the construction of our shovel-ready projects in Latin

purchase price of the capital stock in the subsidiaries of Navios Maritime 
Acquisition that own the four vessels in our initial fleet. 

The purchase price of the capital stock of the subsidiaries that own the four 
vessels in our initial fleet will be equal to: 

. all of the net proceeds from our sale of an aggregate of 8,100,000 common 
  units in this offering ($110.4 million, based on (i) the initial public 
  offering price of $15.00 per common unit and (ii) underwriting discount and

  Navios Maritime Acquisition, plus 

. the 2.0% general partner interest and all of our incentive distribution
  rights to be issued to our general partner.

Based on the initial public offering price of $15.00 per common unit and 
assuming that the fair market value of each subordinated unit and general 
partner unit is $15.00, the total dollar value of the consideration to be paid
to Navios Maritime Acquisition for the capital stock of the subsidiaries that 
own or have rights to the vessels in our initial fleet is approximately $379.4
million. 

The initial public offering price of our common units, as well as the total 
consideration to be paid to Navios Maritime Acquisition for the capital stock 
of the subsidiaries that own the four vessels in our initial fleet was 
determined through negotiations among us and the representatives of the 
underwriters. In addition to prevailing market conditions, the factors 
considered in determining the initial public offering price as well as the 
total consideration for the capital stock of the subsidiaries that own the 
vessels in our initial fleet were: 

. the valuation multiples of publicly traded companies that the representatives
  believe to be comparable to us, 

. our financial information, 

. the history of, and the prospects for, our partnership and the industry in 
  which we compete, 

. an assessment of our management, its past and present operations, and the 
  prospects for, and timing of, our future revenues, and 

. the above factors in relation to market values and various valuation measures
  of other companies engaged in activities similar to ours. 

We will use the net proceeds of any exercise of the underwriters’ option to 
redeem for cash a number of common units from Navios Maritime Acquisition equal
to the number of units for which the underwriters exercise their option. 

Navios Maritime Acquisition will use the proceeds it receives from us for 
general corporate purposes. These general corporate purposes may include the 
acquisition of additional vessels, capital expenditures or the repayment of 
debt."

$1.2 million and we received approximately an additional $0.3 million in gross
proceeds from our convertible promissory note financing in August 2014, and an
additional $0.5 million in gross proceeds from our convertible promissory note
financing in October 2014. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering
as follows:

. Approximately $5.6 million of the net proceeds from this offering will fund 
  our commercial launch of CoSense; and  

. Approximately $2.6 million to fund working capital, capital expenditures, 
  research and development of additional future products, and other general 
  corporate purposes, which may include the acquisition or licensing of other 
  products, businesses or technologies, although we have no plans regarding 
  any specific acquisition candidates at this time.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. We believe that
the proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to support hiring of commercial
personnel at the level that we have described herein, and will support our
anticipated marketing spends related to the launch of CoSense. To the extent
that warrant exercises result in additional cash proceeds to the company, we
anticipate deploying these funds on expansion of marketing and medical affairs
activities supporting CoSense, as well as in research, development, and launch
expenses related to additional products on the Sensalyze platform. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on
numerous factors, including the progress of our development and
commercialization efforts and the status of and results from clinical studies,
as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering described above,
and our planned use of our existing cash and cash equivalents, we expect that
such funds may not be sufficient to enable us to complete our planned
development of additional diagnostic products based on our Sensalyze Technology
Platform. Nor do we expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our
existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund
Phase 3 clinical trials for Serenz, if necessary for regulatory approval in the
U.S., or other development work that might be necessary to advance Serenz toward
product launch or partnership.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments such as money market
funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and U.S. government securities."

$10.9 million, or $12.6 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares of our common stock is exercised in full, underwriting
discount payable by us, will be approximately $145.3 million, or $167.1 million
if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of our common stock is
exercised in full, based on an initial offering price of $15.00 per share. In
addition, we expect to receive approximately $18.0 million of gross proceeds
from the Debt Refinancing concurrent with the completion of this offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds received from the Debt Refinancing and the net
proceeds from the sale of common stock by us in this offering:

(i)   to repay our Existing Indebtedness (as defined below) and accrued interest
      and to effect the Preferred B Stock Redemption;                

(ii)  to pay fees and expenses related to this offering and the Debt 
      Refinancing; and                   

(iii) to support our growth, primarily through installing new Freshpet Fridges 
      and adding manufacturing capacity, and for working capital and general 
      corporate purposes.                                            

We have a $20.0 million revolving payable note (the “$20.0 Million Revolver”),
which matures on October 31, 2015. The borrowings bear interest at either a
LIBOR Rate plus 8% margin or a Base Rate plus 6%, depending on our election.
Borrowings on this note payable totaled $20.0 million at June 30, 2014. In
addition, in September and October of 2014 we increased our $20.0 Million
Revolver to $27.0 million and drew an additional $4.0 million of the available
capacity on this facility. The $4 Million Draw matures on April 30, 2015 and has
the same interest rate as our $20.0 Million Revolver. The $4 Million Draw was
used for working capital.

We also have a $62.5 million revolving payable note (the “$62.5 Million
Revolver”), which matures on May 1, 2016. Subject to certain conditions, the
maturity date may be extended until May 1, 2017. The $62.5 Million Revolver
bears interest at either a LIBOR Rate (LIBOR Adjusted Rate plus 3.25%) or a Base
Rate (Base Rate plus 2.25%). Monthly, LIBOR Rate loans are payable at the end of
the selected interest rate. Borrowings on the $62.5 Million Revolver totaled
$62.5 million at June 30, 2014. We refer to the $20.0 Million Revolver
(including the $4 Million Draw) and the $62.5 Million Revolver as our “Revolving
Note Payable.”

We also have a $1.5 million note issued to certain stockholders (the
“Stockholder Note”) and $2.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
convertible notes issued to certain stockholders (the “Convertible Notes”). The
Stockholder Note accrues interest compounded annually at a rate of 10%, and the
Convertible Notes, beginning on December 7, 2014, accrue interest compounded
annually at 15%. The Stockholder Note and all accrued interest are due on
December 23, 2020, and the Convertible Notes and all accrued interest are due on
November 1, 2017. We refer to the $20.0 Million Revolver (including the $4
Million Draw), the $62.5 Million Revolver, the Stockholder Note and the
Convertible Notes as our “Existing Indebtedness.” In addition, we have
112,160 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, which we expect to
redeem in connection with this offering. As of June 30, 2014, the redemption
price for the Series B Preferred Stock was $33.1 million.

exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that
our net proceeds would be approximately $46.0 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We intend to use approximately $11.5 million of the net proceeds of this
offering to repay outstanding and accrued interest under our loan and security
agreements with Comerica Bank. As of June 30, 2014, we had $3.6 million
outstanding as revolving loans and $18.9 million as term loans under our loan
and security agreements. The revolving loans and term loans bear interest at a
floating rate equal to Comerica Bank’s prime rate plus 1.75%. All outstanding
revolving loan amounts must be repaid on April 11, 2015. All outstanding
principal and interest under the term loan must be repaid on April 11, 2018.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, improve our visibility in the marketplace and create a public
market for our common stock. Although we do not have current specific plans for
the net proceeds of this offering, we generally intend to use the net proceeds
of this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
including to finance our growth by investing in or acquiring complementary
companies, products or technologies, expanding our sales force, growing sales of
our applications and improving and enhancing our applications. We do not have
agreements or commitments for any investments or acquisitions at this time. Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the proceeds.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan
to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing
securities, such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial
paper or obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government."

stock in this offering will be approximately $75.2 million at the initial public

underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of
common stock, we estimate that net proceeds will be approximately $87.0 million
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from this
offering as follows:

. approximately $7.0 million to fund clinical development for CHS-0214 (our 
  etanercept (Enbrel) biosimilar candidate); 

. approximately $34.0 million to fund clinical development for CHS-1420 (our
  adalimumab (Humira) biosimilar candidate);

  pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) biosimilar candidate); 

. approximately $3.0 million to pursue our development pipeline; and 

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which
  may include the licensing of other products or technologies. 

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development and
commercialization process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact
amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above
purposes. Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net
proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors, including the timing and success of preclinical
studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in
the future, the timing of regulatory submissions, any unforeseen delays or
problems in the development of our manufacturing capabilities and supply chain,
and the timing and amount of our future revenue, our future expenses as well as
any collaborations or licensing that we may enter into with third parties for
our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and expected funding under our license agreements, we estimate that such
funds will be sufficient to enable us to complete our ongoing clinical studies
of CHS-0214, CHS-1420 and CHS-1701. We will require substantial capital in order
to complete the remaining clinical development and to potentially commercialize
these product candidates.

proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities."

. approximately $60.0 to $80.0 million to continue funding our activities 
  related to seeking U.S. regulatory approval and preparing for the commercial
  launch of Senza in the United States; and 

. the remainder, if any, for sales and marketing efforts throughout the first

approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts
of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes.
As such, our management will retain discretion over the use of the net proceeds
from this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including the timing of U.S. regulatory approval and
commercial launch of Senza, the size, scope and timing of any additional
research and development efforts and clinical trials that we may decide to
pursue for Senza for potential future indications or chronic pain conditions and
the amount of revenue received from our existing sales in Europe and Australia.
Following our commercial launch of Senza in the United States, if Senza is
approved by the FDA, we may need to raise additional capital.

The indebtedness that we will assume will have been incurred under Midstream
Operating's existing midstream credit facility to fund capital expenditures
incurred with respect to the Predecessor. As of June 30, 2014, there was
approximately $320.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the existing
midstream credit facility, which matures on the earlier of May 12, 2016 or the
consummation of a Qualified IPO (as defined in the credit facility agreement
which would include this offering) and bears interest at a variable rate, which
was approximately 1.94% as of June 30, 2014. Of the outstanding balance,
$228.9 million was related to the gathering and compression assets. The
borrowings to be repaid were incurred to fund the development of the
Predecessor. In addition, we expect to enter into a new revolving credit
facility in connection with the closing of this offering.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, we intend to use the net proceeds resulting from any
issuance of common units upon such exercise to acquire an equivalent number of
common units from Antero, which common units would be cancelled, to reimburse
Antero for capital expenditures incurred in connection with the Predecessor
prior to Midstream Operating being contributed to us. Accordingly, the exercise
of the underwriters' option will not affect the total number of common units
outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly
distribution on all units.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under Midstream
Operating's existing midstream credit facility and, accordingly, will receive a
portion of the proceeds of this offering."

public offering price of $9.00 per common share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions, fees payable in connection with the
concurrent private placement and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement as follows:

. approximately $17.0 million for preclinical and early clinical development

. approximately $11.0 million to fund genetic research and drug discovery 
  activities using our Extreme Genetics discovery platform; and

co-development or co-promotion rights under our collaborations; however, no such
rights are currently exercisable. In addition, we may also use a portion of the
net proceeds to acquire, license and invest in complementary products,
technologies or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or
commitments to complete any such transaction.

This expected use of the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent
private placement represents our intentions based on our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon
the closing of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the
uses set forth above. The amounts, allocation and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including:

. the focus and results of our research, drug discovery and preclinical 
  development activities; 

. the type, number, costs and results of any clinical trials for our product 
  candidates; 

. regulatory actions relating to our product candidates; 

. our ability to achieve milestones and obtain royalty payments from our 
  collaborators; 

. whether any co-funding or co-promotion rights under our strategic alliances 
  are exercised; 

. competitive and technological developments; and 

. the rate of growth, if any, of our business."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $242.8 million, or 
approximately $279.7 million if the underwriters exercise their option to 
purchase additional shares in full, based upon the initial public offering 
price of $24.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. $30.0 million to advance JCAR015 through a Phase II clinical trial and the 
  filing of a Biologics License Application for the treatment of r/r ALL;

. $25.0 million to advance JCAR017 through a Phase I/II clinical trial and 
  into a potential registration trial in r/r NHL;

. $27.5 million to further develop any additional product candidates that we 
  select;

. $42.5 million to expand our internal research and development capabilities;

. $20.0 million to establish manufacturing capabilities; and

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We expect to also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire, license and 
invest in complementary products, technologies or businesses; however, we 
currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transaction. 
If the conditions on the effectiveness of our license agreement with Opus Bio, 
Inc. are satisfied, we intend to use our existing cash resources to fund the 
$20.0 million cash payment we will owe the licensor.

We cannot provide an accurate estimate as to how far into a potential 
registration trial of JCAR017 in r/r NHL the allocated proceeds will allow us 
to reach because any such estimate depends on the clinical trial design, which 
cannot be developed until we receive a substantial amount of data from our 
planned Phase I clinical trial for JCAR017. In addition, we cannot specify 
with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received 
upon the closing of this offering. Due to uncertainties inherent in the product 
development process, it is difficult to estimate the exact amounts of the net 
proceeds that will be used for any particular purpose. We may use our existing 
cash and the future payments, if any, generated from any future collaboration 
agreements to fund our operations, either of which may alter the amount of net 
proceeds used for a particular purpose. In addition, the amount, allocation 
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, 
including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and 
success of clinical trials, the timing of regulatory submissions, and the 
amount of cash, if any, we generate from any future collaboration agreements. 
Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds.

Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in 
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, certificates of 
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

in this offering will be approximately $6,910,000 based on an initial public
offering price of $5.75 per unit, after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the
net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $8,005,000.
 
The largest single variable in our estimates of bringing the product to market
is what requirements will be placed on us by the FDA for product clearance
(these can vary greatly). The Company has requested, but has not yet been
granted a meeting with the FDA to discuss the regulatory path leading to human
clinical trials. Without the FDA’s feedback, a “probable path” is difficult to
estimate with the DenerVex. Therefore, we have assumed the most probable path
and requirements necessary for clearance, but unexpected requirements or
significantly larger patient counts required in a human clinical trial which
currently assume a 150 patient clinical trial could increase these estimates,
although we do not believe that such a requirement is likely with the DenerVex.
We have estimated the following costs to take the product to market and absorb
losses until a cash breakeven point could be reached:
 
. $2,300,000 for a human clinical trial

. $1,100,000 for product development (including production of sample units)

. $890,000 for regulatory, reimbursement and other experts to obtain regulatory
  approvals and be ready to sell to and be paid by our target customers  

. $726,000 for general and administrative expenses

. $1,894,000 for working capital and other general corporate purposes

The amounts allocated for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
may include the development, acquisition or in licensing of medical products’
companies or their technologies. Although we have no current commitments or
binding agreements with respect to any material acquisition of or investment in
any technologies, products or companies, we recently entered into a non-binding
memorandum of understanding with a development stage company in the business of
redesigning medical equipment to improve the safety, efficiency and
profitability of healthcare environments in exchange for a combination of cash
and common stock. There can be no assurance that we will enter into any binding
agreement to acquire such company. Any amounts received from the exercise of the
Series A Warrants will be allocated for working capital.
 
This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and
results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter
into with third parties for our products, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from this offering.
 
Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities.
 
We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and
capital expenditure requirements for at least 18 months. Until such time, if
ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we may finance our cash
needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings,
collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not have
any committed external source of funds. If we are unable to raise additional
funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to
delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future
commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product
candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves."

additional shares is exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common
stock offered by us in this offering after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes:

. approximately $21.0 million to fund our ongoing and planned Phase 1/2 clinical 
  trials of BPX-501;  

. approximately $30.0 million to fund pre-clinical studies for BPX-401, BPX-601 
  and BPX-701 and fund the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of BPX-401, partially fund 
  the planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of BPX-601 and fund the Phase 1/2 
  clinical trial of BPX-701 as well as preclinical development of our other CAR 
  T and TCR programs;  

. approximately $4.0 million to fund our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial and 
  our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of BPX-201 in combination with checkpoint 
  inhibitors;  

. approximately $11.0 million to fund the construction of tenant improvements 
  and the purchase of capital equipment at our Houston facility, to accommodate 
  our anticipated personnel needs for the next three years and to support our 
  planned in-house new product discovery and development, as well as process 
  development and manufacturing for U.S. clinical trials of planned product 
  candidates or certain critical components thereof; and  

. the remainder to fund other working capital purposes, including general 
  operating expenses.  

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire,
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property,
products or assets. However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do
so.

Furthermore, we anticipate that we will use our cash and cash equivalents on
hand to pay our obligations under a promissory note held by ARIAD, or the ARIAD
note, including $20 million of which we expect to pay upon the closing of this
offering and $15 million of which we intend to pay within nine months of the
closing of this offering.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to gain access to additional financing, the
relative success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development
programs and whether we are able to enter into future licensing arrangements. As
a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might decide
to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or preclinical activities if the net
proceeds from this offering and any other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade

the offering for working capital and for other general corporate purposes,
including investments in sales and marketing in North America and Europe (among
other things, the hiring of additional quota carrying sales people) and in
research and development. We also anticipate using the additional working
capital to offset a decrease in our cash flow from operations that we expect as
a result of a planned reduction in incentives for annual and multi-year
contracts. This reduction is not expected to adversely affect revenue.

Additionally, we may choose to expand our current business through acquisitions

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and
    a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    borrowed from Coronado Biosciences described below. These funds will be 
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. 

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of 
    the private units. 

(3) The funds held in the trust account will be used to acquire a target 
    business, to pay holders who wish to convert their shares into a portion of
    the funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating 
    thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to 4.0% of the 
    gross proceeds raised in this offering upon consummation of our initial 
    business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial 
    business combination. Any remaining funds will be disbursed to the combined
    company and be used as working capital to finance the operations of the 
    target business.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $200,000 
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income 
    earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes 
    owed on such interest income) will be available to us to pay for our 
    working capital requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust 
    account will be approximately $30,000 over a 18-month period assuming an 
    interest rate of approximately 0.05% per year. 

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of that business 
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of 
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated
    expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates 
    for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess 
    working capital. 

(6) Pursuant to the terms of the agreement with Coronado Biosciences, we may 
    delay payment of the monthly fee upon a determination by our audit 
    committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay 
    actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business 
    combination. We anticipate this determination would be made after six 
    months and therefore are only estimating such amounts to be paid at this 
    time.  

Coronado Biosciences and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) have committed
to purchase an aggregate of 285,000 private units at a price of $10.00 per unit
($2,850,000 in the aggregate) in a private placement that will occur
simultaneously with the closing of this offering. EarlyBirdCapital has also
agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters, it
(and/or its designees) will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 3,000 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised. These additional
private units will be purchased in a private placement that will occur
simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the
over-allotment option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will
be placed in the trust account described below. The foregoing purchases will be
made by Coronado Biosciences and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (and/or their designees)
only if they are able to do so in accordance with Regulation M and Sections
9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

$40,900,000, or $46,735,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at Morgan Stanley in the United States, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income
or other tax obligations and (ii) any remaining interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital
requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we will pay Coronado Biosciences, an
affiliate of our executive officers, a monthly fee of $10,000 pursuant to a
letter agreement for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. Pursuant to the terms of such agreement, we
may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by our audit
committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay actual or
anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business combination. Any
such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and either be due and payable no
later than the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or,
at Coronado Biosciences’ option, treated as working capital loans and be
convertible into additional private units as described below. If a business
combination is not consummated within the required time period, the accrued
amount will be forgiven. The foregoing arrangement is being agreed to by
Coronado Biosciences for our benefit and is not intended to provide our
executive officers compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents
and fees for similar services in Burlington, Massachusetts, that the fee charged
by Coronado Biosciences is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a
business combination or our liquidation.

Other than the $10,000 monthly administrative fee, no compensation of any kind
(including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of
our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the
consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$200,000. In addition, the interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be released to
us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for a business
combination. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with  activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to
use the after-tax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees
to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for
director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held
in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial 
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our 
behalf as described below. 

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering, 
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert their shares into a portion of the funds held 
in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including a fee
payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds raised in this
offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable)
upon consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in 
connection with our initial business combination. The use of any funds from the
trust account to pay such expenses could result in fewer holders being able to 
convert their shares. To the extent that our share capital is used in whole or
in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in
the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination, to 
pay holders who wish to convert their shares into a portion of the funds held 
in the trust account or pay our expenses relating thereto (which could include
the up to $1,840,000 payable to EarlyBirdCapital described above if the 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be disbursed to the combined 
company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as 
working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working 
capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or 
expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for 
marketing, research and development of existing or new products. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Coronado Biosciences has
agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of September 9, 2014, Coronado Biosciences loaned to us an aggregate of
$200,000 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced
in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the
non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and
audit fees and expenses. The loan is payable without interest on the earlier of
(i) September 8, 2015, (ii) the date on which we consummate our initial public
offering or (iii) the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial
public offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
available to us for payment of offering expenses.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be
evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation
of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s
discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of
our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per
unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000
ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 rights
included in the private units would result in the issuance of 5,000 shares upon
the closing of our business combination, as well as 50,000 warrants to purchase
25,000 shares). Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and
underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder
wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial
business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination,
the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such public shares or
sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection with a business
combination which we consummate or in connection with an amendment to our
memorandum and articles of association prior to the consummation of an initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

approximately $45.3 million, based upon the initial public offering price of
$8.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares, there will be no change in total proceeds
to us, as any additional shares would be sold by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use approximately $13.9 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to:

• pay unpaid dividends accumulated through the closing of this offering on  
  our outstanding shares of preferred stock, as follows:                    

• $5.0 million in dividends will be paid on our outstanding shares of   
  Series A preferred stock, which have accrued at a rate of 8% per annum
  of the original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of 
  which the amount payable in cash as of September 30, 2014 is $4.5     
  million and is estimated to be $5.0 million upon the closing of this  
  offering; and                                                         

• $4.0 million in dividends will be paid on our outstanding shares of   
  Series B preferred stock, which have accrued at a rate of 8% per annum
  of the original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of 
  which the amount payable in cash as of September 30, 2014 is $3.6     
  million and is estimated to be $4.0 million upon the closing of this  
  offering.                                                             

• repay outstanding promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of   
  approximately $3.0 million and unpaid interest thereon, which accrues at a
  rate of 8% per annum; the amount payable was $3.4 million as of September 
  30, 2014 and is estimated to be $3.5 million upon the closing of this     
  offering. These notes become due and payable on January 15, 2015, at which
  time the amount payable is expected to be $3.5 million.                   

• repay outstanding promissory notes (held by investors affiliated with     
  members of our board of directors) in the aggregate principal amount of   
  approximately $1.3 million and unpaid interest thereon, which accrues at a
  rate of 14% per annum; the amount payable was $1.3 million as of September
  30, 2014 and is estimated to be $1.3 million upon the closing of this     
  offering. These notes become due and payable on May 29, 2015, at which    
  time the amount payable is expected to be $1.4 million.          

We intend to use the remainder for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, including to develop new technologies, fund capital expenditures, make
investments in or acquisitions of other businesses, solutions or technologies or
repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings. We currently have no plan or
proposal to make any particular such investment or acquisition. We do not have
current specific plans for the use of a significant portion of the net proceeds
from this offering.

As a result of the anticipated payment of accumulated and unpaid dividends on
our outstanding shares of preferred stock, certain of our executive officers,
directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding shares of common
stock and affiliated entities who are holders of our preferred stock will
receive approximately $5.0 million in dividends on our outstanding shares of
Series A preferred stock, which have accumulated at a rate of 8% per annum of
the original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of which the
amount payable in cash as of September 30, 2014 is $4.5 million, and
approximately $4.0 million in dividends on our outstanding shares of Series B
preferred stock, which have accumulated at a rate of 8% per annum of the
original issue price of each such share of preferred stock, of which the amount
payable in cash as of September 30, 2014 is $3.6 million.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the
selling stockholders. In the event that the underwriters exercise their option
to purchase additional shares in full, the selling stockholders who are our
executive officers, members of our board of directors, beneficial owners of 5%
or more of our outstanding shares of common stock and affiliated entities, will
receive approximately $7.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares in
this offering at the initial public offering price of $8.00 per share, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions payable by such selling
stockholders.

Pending the uses mentioned above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds to
us from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the proceeds."

offering will be approximately $705.0 million, based upon the initial public
offering price of $15.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts

underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of common stock from us is
exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us would be
approximately $828.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive
any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and enable
access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to us from this offering. Currently, we intend to use the
net proceeds to us from this offering for general corporate purposes, including
working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. We also expect to
use a portion of the net proceeds to us to repay in full the indebtedness
outstanding under our term loan with several lenders led by Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc., which we entered into to fund a portion of the cash
purchase price of Springstone. As of September 30, 2014, we had an outstanding
balance of $49.2 million under this term loan with an interest rate of 2.57% per
annum. This term loan matures in April 2017. 

Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to us to acquire
businesses, products, services or assets. We do not, however, have agreements or
commitments for any material acquisitions at this time. Accordingly, our
management will have discretion in the application of the net proceeds to us
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the use of these net proceeds. Pending the use of the net
proceeds to us as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds to us in
short-term and long-term interest-bearing obligations, including government and
investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. We cannot predict
whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return."

           capital and other general corporate purposes.                           

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts we
actually expend in these areas may vary significantly from our current
intentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including success of our
product development and commercialization efforts, cash generated from future
operations, if any, and actual expenses to operate our business. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the net proceeds.

Pending use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds in
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government, or hold as
cash."
