(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    December 31, 2015, we had borrowed $150,000 under the promissory note with
    our sponsor and had a payable to an affiliate of $23,075. Subsequent to
    December 31, 2015, our sponsor loaned us an additional $150,000 under the
    promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
    These amounts will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the
    $2,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of
    offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to
    be held in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less
    than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing
    working capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more
    than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held
    in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial 
    business combination, $15,750,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or $18,112,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the 
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a ""no shop"" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $450,000,000 (or $517,500,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $15,750,000 (or $18,112,500 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $80,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 0.02% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the 
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest 
rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of 
income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or 
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are 
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business 
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust 
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or 
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business 
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and 
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of 
December 31, 2015, we had borrowed $150,000 under the promissory note with our
sponsor. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, our sponsor loaned us an additional
$150,000 under the promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at
the earlier of March 31, 2016 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering
proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds 
in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant
to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's ""penny stock"" rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered
in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business
combination within 24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations (including
but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with 
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with 
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection 
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our 
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating 
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."
"PROTEOSTASIS THERAPEUTICS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/proteostasis-therapeutics-inc-787729-80060,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/proteostasis-therapeutics-inc-787729-80060,424B4,2/12/2016,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11171985,"We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in
this offering will be approximately $43.0 million, or $50.0 million if the
underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares, based on
the initial public offering price of $8.00 per share and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds
received by us in this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $16 million to advance PTI-428 as a treatment for CF into a
  Phase 1 clinical trial and through the completion of the Phase 2 clinical 
  trial;                                                                    

• approximately $18 million to continue to advance and to expand our research
  and development of our product candidates in CF and other indications and for
  the Usp14 and UPR programs; and                       

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which
  will include funding for the hiring of additional personnel, capital
  expenditures and the costs of operating as a public company.              

To the extent that our actual net proceeds from this offering are insufficient
to fund this allocation, we intend to prioritize expenditures related to our
working capital needs and advancing PTI-428 into Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical
trials.

The amount spent and the timing of expenditures for these purposes may vary
significantly and will depend on a number of factors. Accordingly, our
management will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this 
offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in 
high-quality, investment-grade, short-term fixed income instruments, which 
include corporate, financial institution, federal agency or U.S. government
obligations."
"AVEXIS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/avexis-inc-975334-80185,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/avexis-inc-975334-80185,424B4,2/11/2016,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11171172,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 4,750,000 shares
of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $85.9 million (or 
$99.1 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares), based on the initial public offering price of $20.00 per 
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us.

As of December 31, 2015, we estimate that we had cash and cash equivalents of 
approximately $62 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• Approximately $45 million to $60 million to fund our ongoing Phase 1 clinical
  trial and future SMA trials for AVXS-101;

• Approximately $55 million to $70 million to fund our manufacturing activities,
  including the establishment of our own manufacturing facility, to support our
  ongoing and future trials for AVXS-101; and

• the balance for other general corporate purposes, including general and 
  administrative expenses and working capital.

Our independent registered public accountants have not audited, reviewed or
performed any procedures with respect to our estimated cash and cash equivalents
as of December 31, 2015 and accordingly do not express an opinion or any other
form of assurance with respect thereto. This result could change as a result of
further review.

Based on our current operational plans and assumptions, we expect that the net
proceeds from this offering, combined with our current cash and cash 
equivalents, will be sufficient to fund operations through 2017 and enable us to
initiate our planned pivotal trials of AVXS-101 for SMA Type 1, which we expect
to initiate in the first half of 2017, but that we will need to raise additional
capital in order to complete those trials and any potential future trials that
may be required by regulatory authorities. Our expected use of net proceeds from
this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business condition. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with
complete certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be
received upon the completion of this offering or the actual amounts that we will
spend on the uses set forth above. We believe opportunities may exist from time
to time to expand our current business through the acquisition or in-license of
complementary product candidates. While we have no current agreements for any
specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion of the
net proceeds for these purposes.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and other development and
commercialization efforts for AVXS-101, as well as the amount of cash used in
our operations. We therefore cannot estimate with certainty the amount of net
proceeds to be used for the purposes described above. We may find it necessary
or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described
above, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,

offering will be approximately $144.86 million based upon the initial public
offering price of $24.00 per ADS and after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $166.95 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for the ADSs, and to facilitate our access
to the public equity markets. We currently expect to use the net proceeds from
this offering as follows:

. approximately $35 million for the ongoing dose-expansion phase of our clinical
  trial, other planned signal-seeking monotherapy and combination trials, as 
  well as potentially initiating a registrational trial for BGB-3111;

. approximately $12 million for the ongoing dose-expansion phase of our clinical
  trial, and other planned monotherapy and combination trials for BGB-283;

. approximately $9 million for the ongoing dose-escalation phase of our clinical
  trial, the planned expansion phase of our clinical trial, and other planned 
  monotherapy and combination studies for BGB-290;

. approximately $23 million for the ongoing dose-escalation phase of our 
  clinical trial, the planned expansion phase of our clinical trial, and other 
  planned monotherapy and combination studies for BGB-A317;

. approximately $22 million for supporting our research and development 
  infrastructure and the early development of our preclinical candidates; and

. the remainder for working capital, capital expenditure and general corporate 
  purposes, including the potential acquisition and re-acquisition of product 
  rights.

We may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the acquisition or
licensing, as the case may be, of additional technologies, other assets or 
businesses, or for other strategic investments or opportunities, although we 
have no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so at this time.

Based on our current operational plans and assumptions, we expect that the net 
proceeds from this offering, combined with our current operating capital, will 
not be sufficient to enable us to complete all necessary development or 
commercially launch our current drug candidates. However, there can be no
assurance that these expectations will be correct.

We currently have no specific plans as to how the net proceeds from this 
offering will be allocated beyond the uses specified above, and therefore
management will retain discretion to allocate the remainder of the net proceeds
of this offering among these uses.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical studies and any
ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future, as
well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our
drug candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering and may change the allocation of use of these proceeds among the uses
described above. An investor will not have the opportunity to evaluate the
economic, financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how
to use the proceeds.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest
the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments, or hold as cash."

that we are offering will be approximately $84.6 million after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option, we
estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$97.8 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of September 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $155.3 million. 
The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and to facilitate our
access to the public equity markets. We intend to use approximately $15 to $20 
million of the net proceeds from this offering for preclinical studies and 
clinical trials for our LCA10 program and up to $22 million of the net proceeds
from this offering for preclinical studies in our collaboration with Juno 
Therapeutics. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this 
offering for continued expansion of our platform technology, preclinical studies
of our research programs in addition to LCA10 and engineered T cells, working 
capital and general corporate purposes. We believe opportunities may exist from
time to time to expand our current business through acquisitions of 
complementary companies, products, or technologies. While we have no current 
agreements, commitments or understandings for any specific acquisitions at this
time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash 
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and 
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from
clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties
for our programs, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering. We have no current agreements, commitments, or understandings for any
material acquisitions or licenses of any products, businesses, or technologies.
Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service, and capital expenditure
requirements through at least the next 24 months. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not expect that the net
proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development of any product
candidates we may develop.

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the proceeds
in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

million at the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase additional shares of common stock, we estimate that the net proceeds
will be approximately $73.3 million after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We expect to use our existing capital resources and the net proceeds from this
offering as follows:

• approximately $40 million to fund the ongoing clinical development of CPI-444,
  including our Phase 1/1b clinical trial; and

• the remainder to fund the preclinical development of our anti-CD73 adenosine
  production inhibitor, our adenosine A2B receptor antagonist, our ITK inhibitor
  and early-stage research and development of other programs and potential
  future development programs, potential in-licensing of technology or products,
  capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes.
  While we expect the majority of this amount will be allocated to our anti-CD73
  adenosine production inhibitor, the allocation of funds among these product
  candidates will largely depend on their performance in preclinical trials,
  which we are unable to predict.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and
regulatory approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the
exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the
above purposes. We may also find it necessary or advisable to use the net
proceeds from this offering for other purposes. Accordingly, our management will
retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering. The
amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors. For
instance, the amounts and timing of our expenditures will in part depend on the
time and cost necessary to conduct our Phase 1/1b clinical trial, which will
largely depend on the number of patient cohorts that we expand as a result of
patient responses. Because we cannot predict which cohorts, if any, we will
expand, there can be no assurance that our existing capital resources and the
net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to fund our clinical trial
for any specific cohort to completion, and we do not expect such amounts to be
sufficient to fund the full clinical trial to completion. Furthermore, the
amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend on (1) the time and cost
associated with clinical trials and preclinical development of other product
programs; (2) the results of any clinical trials and other studies; and
(3) other factors described included elsewhere in this prospectus.

Following this offering, we will require substantial capital in order to
complete clinical development and commercialize CPI-444 and complete the
clinical development of any additional product candidates.

Pending the use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing investment-grade securities or government
securities."

underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, based
upon the public offering price of $2.85 per share, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 million. We
currently expect that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, together
with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $5.0 million to complete our U.S. pivotal clinical trial and to
  seek regulatory approval of Eversense in the United States;

• approximately $25.0 million to fund continued research and development of
  future configurations of Eversense;

• approximately $5.0 million to begin developing a direct sales force to market
  Eversense in the United States; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into early 2017.
This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our products, and
any unforeseen cash needs.

As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this
offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many
factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our
business. Pending these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United
States. The goal with respect to the investment of these net proceeds is capital
preservation and liquidity so that such funds are readily available to fund our
operations."

proceeds to us from our issuance and sale of 7,500,000 ADSs in this offering
will be approximately $87.8 million, after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and
assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional
ADSs.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with the cash
generated by our operations and other cash resources, primarily to further
advance the clinical development of our multiple drug candidates. In particular,
we currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $41.0 million to accelerate and broaden clinical development of
  the drug candidates for which we retain all worldwide rights, specifically:

i. approximately $20.0 million to advance HMPL-523 through Phase I and into 
   proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in Australia, the United
   States and China, in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and hematological cancer;

ii. approximately $12.0 million to advance sulfatinib toward NDA submission in
    China and through Phase I and into proof-of-concept studies, expected to be
    conducted in the United States, in neuroendocrine tumors, and through Phase
    II and into proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in China, in
    thyroid cancer;

iii. approximately $7.0 million to advance epitinib into a Phase III 
     registration in China and through Phase I and into proof-of-concept 
     studies, expected to be conducted in the United States, in non-small cell
     lung cancer with brain metastasis; and

iv. approximately $2.0 million to advance theliatinib through Phase I and into
    proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in China, in head and 
    neck cancer and esophageal cancer.

• approximately $27.0 million to support our share of the development costs of 
  our partnered clinical drug candidates, including:

i. approximately $12.0 million to advance savolitinib through NDA submission
   globally in papillary renal cell carcinoma and EGFR tyrosine kinase 
   inhibitor-refractory non-small cell lung cancer and through proof-of-concept
   studies in gastric cancer and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-refractory 
   clear cell renal cell carcinoma;

ii. approximately $10.0 million to advance fruquintinib through NDA submission
    in colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in China and through 
    proof-of-concept in gastric cancer in China and to advance fruquintinib into
    proof-of-concept studies in non-small cell lung cancer and/or other solid 
    tumor indications in the United States either independently or in 
    partnership with Eli Lilly subject to the exercise of its global option; and

iii. approximately $5.0 million to advance either existing or new-formulations 
     of HMPL-004 into clinical development in mild-to-moderate ulcerative 
     colitis.

• approximately $11.0 million to progress pre-clinical drug candidates, 
  specifically:

i. approximately $4.0 million to advance HMPL-689 through Phase I and into 
   proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in Australia, the United
   States and China, in hematological cancer;

ii. approximately $4.0 million to advance HMPL-453 through Phase I and into 
    proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in Australia, the United
    States and China, in bladder cancer; and

iii. approximately $3.0 million to advance other drug candidates through 
     pre-clinical studies and into Phase I clinical trials.

• approximately $5.0 million to build production facilities to produce both 
  clinical and commercial supply of our drug candidates.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which we could change in
our discretion in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Due to
the many variables inherent to the development of our drug candidates at this
time, such as the timing of patient enrollment and evolving regulatory 
requirements, we cannot currently predict the stage of development we expect to
achieve for our pre-clinical and clinical trial and drug candidates with the net
proceeds of this offering. We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds 
for working capital and other general corporate purposes, such as acquiring the
commercial rights to other drug products and expanding our research organization
and infrastructure. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the results of the 
pre-clinical and clinical trial of our drug candidates, our operating costs and
expenditures and the amount of cash generated by our operations. As a result, 
our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high-quality,
investment-grade, short-term fixed income instruments."

    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working 
    capital expenses.

    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full for deferred       
    underwriting commissions to be placed in a trust account as described       
    herein. The deferred commissions will be released to the underwriters only  
    on completion of an initial business combination.                           

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. In addition, 
    in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
    business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain 
    of our executive officers, directors and director nominees may, but are not 
    obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial  
    business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds
    of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid  
    only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our
    initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the    
    working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts 
    but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned   
    amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans (including any loans outstanding as 
    of the date of this prospectus) may be convertible into warrants of the post
    business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of
    the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement        
    warrants issued to our sponsor. We do not expect to seek loans from parties 
    other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe  
    third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver       
    against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.    

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.    

(6) Pursuant to an employment agreement entered into between us and Ms. Thom, we
    will pay Ms. Thom a salary of $200,000 annually following the consummation  
    of this offering.                                                           

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $83,200,000 (or $95,680,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be placed in a trust account
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
income taxes, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business
combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable
to complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of this
offering (subject to the requirements of law).

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If the entire purchase price of our initial business combination is
paid for using stock or debt securities, or if not all of the funds released
from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection
with our business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released
from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance
or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital, or up to $300,000 in deferred underwriting commissions, in the event
that the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Pursuant to an employment agreement entered into between us and Ms. Thom, we
will pay Ms. Thom a salary of $200,000 annually following the consummation of
this offering.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$275,000 ($206,000 as of the date of this prospectus), to be used for a portion
of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing,
unsecured and are due at the closing of our initial business combination.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our executive officers, directors and director nominees
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete
our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the
proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be
repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up
to $1,500,000 of such loans (including any loans described above) may be
convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of
$0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical
to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. We do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

In connection with the consummation of our business combination, or thereafter,
we may retain KLR Group to provide certain financial advisory, underwriting,
capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees upon
consummation of such business combination or thereafter. The amount of fees we
pay to KLR Group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services
rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time, and
will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit
committee’s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present
conflicts of interest.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or
their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions
either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our Class A common
stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the
limitations described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we
are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described 
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements)
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other 
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our initial stockholders (or any
of our executive officers, directors or affiliates) acquire public shares in or
after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the
trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our
initial business combination within the prescribed time frame."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    received or will receive as loans from our insiders described below. These 
    funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) Does not include the deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan
    Capital Markets, LLC in an amount equal to 2% of the total gross proceeds 
    raised in the offering described below.

(3) We have agreed to pay Corinthian Partners, LLC a fee in amount equal to ten
    percent (10%) of the gross proceeds from the sale of certain of the Private
    Units and a three percent (3%) non-accountable expense allowance in
    consideration of investment banking services provided. Corinthian Partners,
    LLC is not an underwriter in this offering.

(4) Includes the deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan Capital
    Markets, LLC in an amount equal to 2% of the total gross proceeds raised in
    the offering described below.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business 
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our 
    intended use of proceeds.

Our insiders and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (and/or their respective
designees) have committed that they will purchase the private units (for an
aggregate purchase price of $2,945,000) from us on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Our insiders and Chardan
Capital Markets, LLC have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is
exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they (and/or their designees)
will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of private units
(up to a maximum of 38,025 private units) that is necessary to maintain in the
trust account an amount equal to $10.35 per share of common stock sold to the
public in this offering. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account described below.

$40,365,000, or $46,419,750 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds
held in the trust account will be invested only in United States government
treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S.
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax
obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption
of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business
combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete our initial business combination to the extent not used to pay
converting stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Jensyn Integration Services, LLC, a company owned by our
insiders, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services
including office space, utilities and secretarial support. However, pursuant to
the terms of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a
determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside
the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial
business combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be
due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial
business combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by Jensyn Integration
Services, LLC for our benefit. We believe that the fee charged by Jensyn
Integration Services, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained
from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of
our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of
any kind (including finder’s fees, consulting fees or other similar
compensation) will be paid to our insiders, members of our management team or
any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to
or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination
(regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and
business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or
similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.
Since the role of present management after our initial business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after our initial business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering and insider loans available to us out of trust for
our working capital requirements in searching for our initial business
combination will be approximately $465,000.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available to us from the trust account is insufficient as a result of
the current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC in an
amount equal to 2% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon
consummation of our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial
business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used
to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company
and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing,
research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of December 31, 2015, our insiders and a related party had loaned or advanced
to us an aggregate of $362,320 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of
this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee,
FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses. The loans are payable
without interest no later than the date on which our initial business
combination is consummated.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our insiders, officers and directors (and/or their designees)
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $700,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being
issued 77,000 shares of common stock if $700,000 of notes were so converted
since the 70,000 rights included in the private units would result in the
issuance of 7,000 shares of common stock upon the closing of our business
combination, as well as 70,000 warrants to purchase 35,000 shares). Our
stockholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of
such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time
of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete a
business combination, the $497,320 of loans and advances from our insiders and a
related party, and any other outstanding loans from our insiders, officers and
directors or their affiliates, will be repaid only from amounts remaining
outside our trust account, if any.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any
tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    received or will receive as loans from our insiders described below. These 
    funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) Does not include the deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan
    Capital Markets, LLC in an amount equal to 2% of the total gross proceeds 
    raised in the offering described below.

(3) We have agreed to pay Corinthian Partners, LLC a fee in amount equal to ten
    percent (10%) of the gross proceeds from the sale of certain of the Private
    Units and a three percent (3%) non-accountable expense allowance in
    consideration of investment banking services provided. Corinthian Partners,
    LLC is not an underwriter in this offering.

(4) Includes the deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan Capital
    Markets, LLC in an amount equal to 2% of the total gross proceeds raised in
    the offering described below.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business 
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our 
    intended use of proceeds.

Our insiders and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (and/or their respective
designees) have committed that they will purchase the private units (for an
aggregate purchase price of $2,945,000) from us on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Our insiders and Chardan
Capital Markets, LLC have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is
exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they (and/or their designees)
will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of private units
(up to a maximum of 38,025 private units) that is necessary to maintain in the
trust account an amount equal to $10.35 per share of common stock sold to the
public in this offering. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account described below.

$40,365,000, or $46,419,750 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds
held in the trust account will be invested only in United States government
treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S.
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax
obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption
of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business
combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete our initial business combination to the extent not used to pay
converting stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Jensyn Integration Services, LLC, a company owned by our
insiders, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services
including office space, utilities and secretarial support. However, pursuant to
the terms of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a
determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside
the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial
business combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be
due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial
business combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by Jensyn Integration
Services, LLC for our benefit. We believe that the fee charged by Jensyn
Integration Services, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained
from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of
our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of
any kind (including finder’s fees, consulting fees or other similar
compensation) will be paid to our insiders, members of our management team or
any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to
or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination
(regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and
business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or
similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.
Since the role of present management after our initial business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after our initial business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering and insider loans available to us out of trust for
our working capital requirements in searching for our initial business
combination will be approximately $465,000.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available to us from the trust account is insufficient as a result of
the current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC in an
amount equal to 2% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon
consummation of our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial
business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used
to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company
and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing,
research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of December 31, 2015, our insiders and a related party had loaned or advanced
to us an aggregate of $362,320 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of
this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee,
FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses. The loans are payable
without interest no later than the date on which our initial business
combination is consummated.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our insiders, officers and directors (and/or their designees)
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $700,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being
issued 77,000 shares of common stock if $700,000 of notes were so converted
since the 70,000 rights included in the private units would result in the
issuance of 7,000 shares of common stock upon the closing of our business
combination, as well as 70,000 warrants to purchase 35,000 shares). Our
stockholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of
such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time
of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete a
business combination, the $497,320 of loans and advances from our insiders and a
related party, and any other outstanding loans from our insiders, officers and
directors or their affiliates, will be repaid only from amounts remaining
outside our trust account, if any.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any
tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

this offering will be approximately $46.3 million, based on an initial public
offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds
will be approximately $53.7 million based on an initial public offering price of
$12.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We currently expect
to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments, for the following purposes:

• approximately $28.0 million to support the clinical trials of entinostat in 
  combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), atezolizumab and avelumab through
  the expected completion date of the two Phase 2 clinical trials; 

• approximately $10.0 million to support additional clinical trials of 
  entinostat in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors; 

• approximately $19.0 million to support the Phase 3 clinical trial of 
  entinostat in advanced HR+ breast cancer through the primary endpoint of  
  overall survival data; 

• approximately $16.0 million to conduct activities to support the filing of
  a New Drug Application for entinostat, including manufacturing of registration
  batches of active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product; and

• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
ongoing status of and results from our clinical trials and other studies and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in
applying the net proceeds from this offering. We may use a portion of the net
proceeds from this offering allocated to general corporate purposes for the
acquisition or licensing, as the case may be, of product candidates,
technologies, compounds, other assets or complementary businesses; however, we
have no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so. Pending
these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, will fund our projected operating
expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months."

offering will be approximately $4.6 million, or approximately $5.6 million if
the underwriter exercises in full its option to purchase additional shares of
our common stock, based on the initial public offering price of $6.25 per share,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

Our principal reason for this offering is to provide the Company the option to
exercise the redemption of its outstanding tax-exempt bonds, which would need to
be completed within 90 days after closing of a “public offering” of ownership
interests in the Company. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering 
for working capital and other general corporate purposes. However, we have not
made a definitive determination as to how to allocate these proceeds among these
and other possible general corporate purposes and we do not anticipate doing so
prior to the completion of this offering. We do not intend to use the net
proceeds from this offering to refinance the tax-exempt bonds."

million (assuming all of the units offered hereby are sold excluding the up to
800,000 additional units we have the option to sell as described herein). We
will likely use such funds for:

• research and development and regulatory clearance of our current and future 
  products;
 
• commercialization of our current and future products;
 
• licensing and acquisition of new technologies;
 
• prosecution of patents and the continued protection of our intellectual 
  property rights;
 
• payment of contingent compensation payable to our Chief Executive Officer upon
  successful completion of this offering, which we estimate to be approximately
  $240,000; and
 
• working capital and general corporate purposes.
 
More specifically, we currently anticipate that an aggregate of  $2,958,796 the
net proceeds of this offering will be used for the development, regulatory
clearance and commercialization of certain of our lead projects as follows:
PortIO up to $677,315, Caldus up to $827,037, CarpX up to $427,778, NextCath up
to $513,333 and NextFlo up to $513,333. As indicated below, we will not receive
sufficient net proceeds to commercialize our products from this offering unless
we raise at least $6,000,000. If we raise less than that amount, we will seek to
raise additional funds through other equity or debt financings to satisfy our
working capital needs. We cannot assure you that such financings will be
available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. If such financings are not
available to us, we will target one product for initial commercialization until
we have additional funds available to commercialize our other products.

We may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire and invest in
complementary products, technologies or businesses; however, we currently have
no agreement or commitments relating to any such transaction and are not
involved in negotiations to do so. The expected use of net proceeds from this
offering represents our intentions based upon our present plans and business
conditions. We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses
set forth above. Accordingly, we will have significant flexibility in applying
the net proceeds of this offering. The timing and amount of our actual
expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows from operations
and the anticipated growth of our business.

Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade
securities.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of the estimated use of the net
proceeds as we currently expect to use them, assuming the sale of 100%, 80%,

We believe that the funds raised in this offering will allow us to operate for
the next 18 months, 15 months, 11 months, 9 months and 6 months assuming the
sale of 100%, 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% of the units offered for sale in this
offering (including the up to 800,000 additional units we may sell in our sole
discretion as described herein), respectively.

As indicated in the table above, if we sell only 80%, or 60%, or 40%, or 20% of
the units offered for sale in this offering, we would expect to use the
resulting net proceeds generally for the same purposes as we would use the net
proceeds from a sale of 100% of the units, and generally in approximately the
same proportions. We do not intend to prioritize any particular project based on
the amount of proceeds we receive in this offering. Instead, we intend to
allocate funds received in this offering to our products as milestones arise
that require funding. Accordingly, projects that are more advanced at the time
of the closing of this offering will require, and will likely be allocated,
greater amounts of proceeds from this offering to finalize such projects rather
than allocating proceeds to less advanced projects.

In the event we do not sell all of the units being offered, we may seek
additional financing to support the intended use of proceeds discussed above. If
we secure additional equity funding, investors in this offering would be
diluted. In all events, there can be no assurance that additional financing
would be available when needed and, if available, on terms acceptable to us.

In addition, if we sell all of the units being offered (including the 800,000
additional units we have the option to sell as described herein), and if all of
the warrants being offered as part of the units are exercised, we would receive
an additional $10.0 million in proceeds. We cannot predict if or when any such
warrants will be exercised."
PAVMED INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/pavmed-inc-950071-78201,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/pavmed-inc-950071-78201,424B4,1/29/2016,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11136817,"We estimate that the net proceeds of this offering will be approximately $4.9
million (assuming all of the units offered hereby are sold excluding the up to
800,000 additional units we have the option to sell as described herein). We
will likely use such funds for:

• research and development and regulatory clearance of our current and future 
  products;
 
• commercialization of our current and future products;
 
• licensing and acquisition of new technologies;
 
• prosecution of patents and the continued protection of our intellectual 
  property rights;
 
• payment of contingent compensation payable to our Chief Executive Officer upon
  successful completion of this offering, which we estimate to be approximately
  $240,000; and
 
• working capital and general corporate purposes.
 
More specifically, we currently anticipate that an aggregate of  $2,958,796 the
net proceeds of this offering will be used for the development, regulatory
clearance and commercialization of certain of our lead projects as follows:
PortIO up to $677,315, Caldus up to $827,037, CarpX up to $427,778, NextCath up
to $513,333 and NextFlo up to $513,333. As indicated below, we will not receive
sufficient net proceeds to commercialize our products from this offering unless
we raise at least $6,000,000. If we raise less than that amount, we will seek to
raise additional funds through other equity or debt financings to satisfy our
working capital needs. We cannot assure you that such financings will be
available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. If such financings are not
available to us, we will target one product for initial commercialization until
we have additional funds available to commercialize our other products.

We may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire and invest in
complementary products, technologies or businesses; however, we currently have
no agreement or commitments relating to any such transaction and are not
involved in negotiations to do so. The expected use of net proceeds from this
offering represents our intentions based upon our present plans and business
conditions. We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses
set forth above. Accordingly, we will have significant flexibility in applying
the net proceeds of this offering. The timing and amount of our actual
expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows from operations
and the anticipated growth of our business.

Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade
securities.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of the estimated use of the net
proceeds as we currently expect to use them, assuming the sale of 100%, 80%,
60%, 40% and 20% of the units offered for sale in this offering (including the
up to 800,000 additional units we may sell in our sole discretion as described
elsewhere herein):

approximately US$90.2 million if the over-allotment option is not exercised, and
US$104.3 million if the over-allotment option is exercised, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us. In addition, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately
US$10 million from the Concurrent Private Placement.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain and attract talented
employees by providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional
capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent
Private Placement as follows:

. US$30 million to invest in information technology infrastructure and 
  proprietary software;

. US$30 million to develop new businesses including our trading service business 
  on Shanghai Gold Exchange and trading service for other commodities;

. US$20 million to promote our brand and services; and

. the remaining amount for general corporate purposes, including working capital 
  needs and potential acquisitions.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement based upon our present plans and business conditions, but our
management will have significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net
proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement. The occurrence
of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of
the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement in a
manner other than as described in this prospectus. You must rely on the judgment
of our management as to the use of the net proceeds from this offering and the
Concurrent Private Placement, and such use may not produce income or increase
our ADS price.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to
our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, and only if we
satisfy the applicable government registration and approval requirements. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements on a timely
basis, if at all.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest our net proceeds in
short-term interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits."

of our Class A common stock in this offering will be approximately
$100.3 million, or approximately $115.9 million if the underwriters exercise
their over-allotment option in full, based on the initial public offering price
of $14.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated unpaid offering expenses of $3.8 million payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock, obtain
additional capital and increase our recognition in the marketplace. We intend to
use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general
corporate purposes, which may include financing our growth, developing new
solutions and enhancements to our current solutions, and funding capital
expenditures. We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to make investments
in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services and technologies. We
do not have any existing agreements or commitments for any specific investments
or acquisitions. We do not intend to transfer any net proceeds we receive from
this offering to Denali, Dell or their respective affiliates, other than
payments in the ordinary course of business under one or more of the agreements.

Our expected uses of the net proceeds from this offering represent our
intentions based on our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict
with certainty all of the particular uses for such proceeds or the amounts that
we actually will spend on the uses specified above. Accordingly, our management
will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering.

The timing and amount of our actual application of the net proceeds from this
offering will be based on many factors, including our cash flows from operations
and the actual and anticipated growth of our business. Pending the uses set
forth above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in a
variety of investments, including short-term and intermediate-term,
interest-bearing securities."

common stock in this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $145.3 million
(or approximately $168.4 million if the underwriters fully exercise their option
to purchase additional shares of common stock, which, in each case, accounts for
$5.5 million of offering-related costs incurred prior to December 31, 2015).

We intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering, together 
with aggregate borrowings of $75.0 million under our first lien credit facility, 
as amended, and cash on hand, to repay in full all outstanding amounts under our 
second lien credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate on our 
second lien term loans, which were borrowed on March 2013 and are scheduled to 
mature in March 2020, was 8.50%. We may use the remaining balance, if any, for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to fund our 
continued growth through the development of new clinics, expansion of existing 
clinics or acquisition of clinics that we may identify from time to time.

Our use of the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes may 
also include the potential acquisition of, or investment in, technologies or 
companies that complement our business, although we have no current 
understandings, commitments or agreements to do so.

The amounts that we actually expend for these specified purposes may vary
significantly depending on a number of factors, including changes in our growth
strategy, the amount of our future revenues and expenses and our future cash
flow. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net
proceeds of this offering and may spend these proceeds for any purpose,
including purposes not presently contemplated.

Pending the uses described above, we may invest the net proceeds of this 
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

An affiliate of one of the underwriters is a lender under our second lien credit 
facility and will receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. 
Accordingly, this offering is being made in compliance with FINRA Rule 5121."

approximately $979.3 million, or approximately $1.1 billion if the underwriters
exercise their overallotment option in full, in each case after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions related to this offering and estimated
offering expenses. The proceeds of this offering will be used to purchase
approximately 50,000,000 Operating Partnership Units, representing 24% of the
economic interest in the Operating Partnership (assuming that the underwriters
do not exercise their overallotment option) or 27% of the economic interest in
the Operating Partnership if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option shares in full. The Operating Partnership will use the proceeds to repay
$868.1 million of the approximately $4.0 billion of indebtedness under the
Bridge Facilities it assumed from MGM and certain subsidiaries of MGM in
connection with the Formation Transactions, $70.7 million to pay fees and
expenses related to this offering and the Formation Transactions, with the
remainder for general corporate purposes. Any proceeds received in connection
with the exercise by the underwriters of their overallotment option will be used
by the Operating Partnership for general corporate purposes.

The Bridge Facilities will be incurred by MGM and certain of its subsidiaries on
the closing date of this offering, mature one day following the closing date of
this offering, and are expected to carry an interest rate per annum in respect
of the borrowings thereunder equal to an applicable margin of 1.75% plus the
highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime rate of the
administrative agent, and (iii) LIBOR (with a floor of 0%) plus 1.0%. The
proceeds from the Bridge Facilities are expected to be used by MGM and certain
of its subsidiaries to repay certain of MGM’s other outstanding indebtedness,
including indebtedness outstanding under MGM’s existing senior credit facility
and certain of MGM’s outstanding senior notes. The outstanding balance of the
Bridge Facilities will be repaid in full by the Operating Partnership on the
closing date of this offering with the proceeds from the Term Loan Facilities,
the Senior Notes, and this offering as described in the preceding paragraph. In
addition, certain of the underwriters or their affiliates are acting as agents,
arrangers and/or lenders under the Bridge Facilities, Revolving Credit Facility
and Term Loan Facilities. Certain of the underwriters and their affiliates are
also acting as agents, arrangers, lenders, underwriters and/or dealer managers
in connection with debt (including the repayment of such debt) and equity issued
by MGM. In particular, an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated is acting as agent for the lenders and affiliates of Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are lenders
under the Bridge Facilities and, therefore, such affiliates shall receive all or
a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering."

this offering at the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us, will be approximately $42.6 million, or $49.6 million if the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as
follows:

. approximately $25.0 million to fund the continuing development of AEB1102;

. approximately $15.0 million to fund the advancement of additional product  
  candidates; and                                                            

. the balance to fund working capital, including general operating expenses.

Based upon our planned use of our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities and the net proceeds from this offering, we estimate such funds will
be sufficient for us to fund the planned Phase 1 trial in the United States, the
planned Phase 2 trial in Europe for AEB1102 for the treatment of patients with
Arginase I deficiency, and to continue to fund our Phase 1 trial for AEB1102 for
the treatment of solid tumors and initiate two other planned Phase 1 trials for
AEB1102 for the treatment of cancer patients.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with any certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses
set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the
extent of clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors, including the status, results and timing of our current nonclinical
studies and clinical trials we may commence in the future, product approval
process with the FDA, EMA and MHRA, any collaborations that we may enter into
with third parties and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

The expected net proceeds of this offering will not be sufficient for us to fund
any of our product candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need to
raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and
commercialization of our product candidates.

Pending their use as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of  
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our

    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest  
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.             

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business       
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific        
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses  
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal     
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may   
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due       
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The 
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would     
    expect approximately $50,000 per year to be available to us from interest   
    earned on the funds held in the trust account over 24 months following the  
    closing of this offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding   
    this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based
    upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be         
    invested. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection  
    with an intended initial business combination, our sponsors or affiliates of
    our sponsors or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not      
    obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial  
    business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds
    of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid  
    only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our     
    initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the    
    working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts 
    but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned   
    amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of 
    the post business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the 
    option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the sponsor        
    warrants issued to the initial stockholder. The terms of such loans by our  
    sponsors, affiliates of our sponsors, or certain of our officers and        
    directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist 
    with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties     
    other than our sponsors or affiliates of our sponsors as we do not believe  
    third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver       
    against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.    

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.

Of the $252,000,000 in net proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale
of the sponsor warrants described in this prospectus, or approximately
$289,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
$250,000,000 ($10.00 per unit), or $287,500,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited
into a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $2,000,000 (regardless of the
extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised) will be
used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and for
working capital following this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account
will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180
days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account
will be approximately $50,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per
year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held
in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes
and franchise taxes, if any, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our
initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our second amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, or
(iii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (subject
to the requirements of law).

Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on
the trust account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware
franchise taxes for 2016. To the extent that the interest earned on the trust
account, net of income taxes, is not sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes
for 2016, we could pay such franchise taxes with a combination of funds from the
interest earned on the trust account (net of income taxes), working capital held
outside the trust account and/or loans which may be made to us by our sponsors
or an affiliate of our sponsors or certain of our officers and directors. We
expect that we will use all of the interest generated on the funds held in the
trust account to pay taxes. As a result, we expect that such interest will not
be a part of the redemption or liquidating distributions described above.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsors, members of our management team or
their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds
to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which we
will pay our FEI sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative
services provided to members of our management team, in an amount not to exceed
$10,000 per month in the event such space and/or services are utilized and we do
not pay a third party directly for such services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsors have agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of September 30,
2016 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $900,000 of offering proceeds that will be held
outside the trust account that has been allocated to the payment of offering
expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsors or an affiliate of our
sponsors or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the sponsor warrants. The terms of such loans by our
officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

Each warrant would be exercisable for one-half of one share of Class A common
stock. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of Class A
common stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants.
If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a
fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the
nearest whole number the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued
to the warrant holder. As a result, warrant holders not purchasing an even
number of warrants must sell any odd number of warrants in order to obtain full
value from the fractional interest that will not be issued.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. In connection with a proposed business combination, the
determination of whether we satisfy such net tangible asset or cash requirement
would take into account payment in full of the deferred underwriting commissions
upon consummation of such business combination. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our Class A common
stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the
limitations described herein, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our second amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, or
(iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
business combination within 24 months following the closing of this offering,
subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive
their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares
in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our second
amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of our initial public offering. In addition, our initial stockholders
have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business
combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsors or any of
our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $52.5 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $30 million to advance the development of bardoxolone methyl 
  through a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of CTD-PAH;             

• approximately $6 million to advance the development of bardoxolone methyl  
  through Phase 2 clinical programs for the treatment of four etiologies of  
  PH-ILD;                                                                    

• approximately $15 million to advance the development of omaveloxolone,     
  including completion of the MOXIe and MOTOR Phase 2 clinical trials; and   

• the remainder for working capital and other general purposes, including our
  preclinical studies and clinical trials, although we have not allocated    
  specific dollar amounts to such purposes.                                  

To the extent that our actual net proceeds from this offering are insufficient
to fund this allocation, we expect to use some or all of our existing cash and
cash equivalents to fund any difference.

We are also undertaking this offering in order to create a public market for our
Class A common stock and thereby facilitate access to the public equity markets,
increase our visibility in the marketplace, obtain additional capital, and
increase our liquidity. Further, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to
acquire complementary businesses, products, or technologies, although we have no
present commitments or agreements for any specific acquisitions. Pending these
uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the United States.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on
many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of
our business."

after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $968 million (or $1,114

shares).

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering
to repay $947 million principal amount of our outstanding Senior Notes and pay
the related redemption premium. The Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate
of 8.50% and mature on June 30, 2019. We intend to repay the Senior Notes on
June 30, 2016. We intend to use the remaining proceeds, received by us from this
offering for other general corporate purposes. The net proceeds may be
temporarily invested or applied to repay short-term or revolving debt prior to

sale of shares of our common stock by the selling shareholders.

We intend to contribute $25.0 million of the net proceeds that we receive
from this offering to the Bank, of which approximately $4.8 million is expected
to be used in connection with the pending acquisition of wealth management
assets from Sterling National Bank, and to use the remainder for general
corporate purposes, which could include future acquisitions and other growth
initiatives. We do not have any current specific plan for such remaining net
proceeds, and do not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings to
make any material acquisitions or to establish any de novo bank branches, other
than our planned de novo bank branch in St. Louis, Missouri that we expect to
open in 2017. Our management will retain broad discretion to allocate the net
proceeds of this offering. The precise amounts and timing of our use of the

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.
 
(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the 
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this 
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the 
    payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the 
    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such
    amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of 
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the 
    completion of our initial business combination, $21,000,000, which 
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $24,150,000 if the 
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to 
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining 
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders, 
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or 
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest 
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a 
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional 
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special 
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
    treasury obligations. Prior to such time, such proceeds will not be invested
    and will be held in a non-interest bearing trust account. We estimate the 
    interest earned on the trust account following the investment of such funds
    will be approximately $120,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02%
    per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.
 
Of the $614.0 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $705.8 million
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $600 million
($10.00 per unit), or $690 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $14.0 million,
or up to $15.8 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised
in full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this
offering and for working capital following this offering. The proceeds held in
the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on
the trust account following the investment of such funds will be approximately
$120,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year; however, we can
provide no assurances regarding this amount. We will not be permitted to
withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account, except for
the withdrawal of interest to pay our income taxes, if any, until the earliest
of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption
of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted
in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance
or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not
consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering. Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest earned
on the trust account will be sufficient to pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the 
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or 
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of 
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial 
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working 
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or 
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and
administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount
not to exceed $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of July 31, 2016
or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of  $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set
forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no
written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of
our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties
other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

Prior to this offering, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to
which certain anchor investors (including two affiliates of our sponsor) agreed
to purchase an aggregate of 51,000,000 Class A ordinary shares plus 19,083,333
redeemable warrants, for a purchase price of  $10.00 multiplied by the number of
Class A ordinary shares purchased, or $510,000,000 in the aggregate, in a
private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of our initial business
combination. The forward purchase agreement with CFS provides that it may be
excused from its purchase obligation in connection with a specific business
combination, as described below. In connection with these agreements, we issued
to the anchor investors an aggregate of 25% of the founder shares for $0.01 per
share. The founder shares issued to the anchor investors are subject to similar
contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder shares issued to our
sponsor. The anchor investors will have redemption rights with respect to any
public shares they own. The forward purchase warrants will have the same terms
as our public warrants.

The forward purchase agreements also provide that the anchor investors are
entitled to a right of first offer with respect to any proposed sale of
additional equity or equity-linked securities by us for capital raising purposes
in connection with the closing of our initial business combination (other than 
forward purchase shares and forward purchase warrants) and registration rights 
with respect to their forward purchase securities, the Class A ordinary shares 
underlying their forward purchase warrants and their founder shares. The anchor
investors also have a right to acquire an aggregate of five percent of the 
founder shares of any special purpose acquisition company sponsored by 
Chinh E. Chu and William P. Foley, II for 10 years following the date of the 
forward purchase agreements. Chinh E. Chu and William P. Foley, II have agreed,
pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of,
or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have
entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination 
or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months
after the closing of this offering.

The forward purchase agreement with CFS, which is for the purchase of 12,500,000
forward purchase shares and 6,250,000 warrants for an aggregate purchase price
of  $125,000,000, provides that CFS has the right to designate one individual to
be, at its election, either elected as a member of our board of directors or a
non-voting observer of our board of directors. The agreement also provides that
CFS shall be excused from its obligation to purchase forward purchase securities
in connection with a specific business combination if, within five business
days’ following written notice delivered by us of our intention to enter into
such business combination with one or more particular businesses, CFS notifies
us that it has decided not to purchase the forward purchase securities for any
reason, including, without limitation, if it has determined that such purchase
would constitute a conflict of interest. No other forward purchase agreement
contains such an excusal right.

The proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase shares may be used as part of
the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination, expenses
in connection with our initial business combination or for working capital in
the post-transaction company. These purchases will be required to be made
regardless of whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public
shareholders and are intended to provide us with minimum funding level for our
initial business combination."
MERUS N.V.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/merus-nv-977595-79619,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/merus-nv-977595-79619,424B4,5/20/2016,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11402102,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately
$47.3 million (or approximately $55.0 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full), at the initial public offering
price per share of $10.00, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses of the offering that are payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $17.0 million to advance clinical development of MCLA-128 for
  the treatment of HER2-expressing solid tumors, which we expect will be     
  sufficient to complete our Phase 1/2 clinical trial that we initiated in   
  February 2015;                                                             

• approximately $14.0 million to advance clinical development of MCLA-117 for
  the treatment of AML, which we expect will be sufficient to complete our   
  Phase 1/2 clinical trial that we initiated in May 2016;                    

• approximately $10.0 million to advance development of MCLA-158 for the 
  treatment of colorectal cancer, which we expect will be sufficient to complete
  pre-clinical development and submit an IND application to the FDA to initiate
  a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States; and           

• the remainder to fund our other current and future research and development
  activities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.   

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire, or invest in additional
businesses, technologies, products or assets, although currently we have no
specific agreements, commitments or understandings in this regard. As of the
date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or
the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Predicting
the costs necessary to develop bispecific antibody candidates can be difficult.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development efforts, the status of and results from pre-clinical
studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in
the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our bispecific antibody candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As
a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
through at least the next 24 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources
sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations and certificates of
deposit."

global offering, assuming the placement of all shares offered and no exercise of
the international underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, will be
approximately US$200 million, after deducting estimated underwriting fees and
transaction expenses payable by us, based on an offering price per Class B share
of US$2.20 and per ADS of US$11.00, the price set forth in the cover of this
prospectus.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Class B shares by the
selling shareholder.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the global offering for the following
purposes:

(i) primarily to increase the volume of assets and loans of our subsidiaries to
    sustain our expansion process and strengthen our position within the
    Argentine financial system. For example, to the extent opportunities to
    increase our assets and loans through acquisitions in the Argentine banking,
    asset management or insurance sectors arise, we may apply a portion of the
    net proceeds to harness those opportunities, although as of the date of this
    prospectus we have no current plans, arrangements or understandings to make
    any material acquisition; and

(ii) we intend to retain up to US$40.0 million at the holding company level to
     redeem or cancel at maturity each series of our outstanding notes due on or
     prior to January 28, 2017 issued by Grupo Supervielle in the Argentine
     capital markets.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based on our present plans and
business condition. The amounts and timing of any expenditure may vary depending
on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive developments, our
rate of growth and inorganic growth opportunities, if any, of our business.
Therefore, as of the date of this prospectus, we cannot estimate the amounts or
timing in respect of any of the purposes for the use of proceeds listed above.

Pending the use of the net proceeds of this offering as described above, we may
invest the net proceeds of this offering in Central Bank notes."

stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $4.00 per
share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses of $1,010,000, will be approximately $17,425,000
million, or $20,190,000 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund:

• $9.0 million to $12.0 million of ongoing research and development of our 
  products and NPES technology including, but not limited to:               

• clinical and pre-clinical research and development with respect to 
  applications of our NPES technology, including labor; and             

• product development including labor costs, equipment, prototype and clinical
  instruments, and third party development costs.              

• $5.0 million to $8.0 million of general corporate purposes, including working 
  capital, business development, commercialization activities, administrative 
  support services, hiring of additional personnel and the costs of operating as
  a public company.                                   

We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary products,
services, technologies or businesses. However, we have no understandings,
agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition at this time. You
will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of
the net proceeds.

We anticipate using a portion of the proceeds of this offering to pay MDB
Capital Group, LLC for services rendered related to patent related matters.
Currently the company has accrued fees in the amount of $25,964 related to
patents, and it will continue to incur amounts due for future fees, which cannot
be estimated at this time. We also will use a portion of the proceeds to pay the
employment obligations of the company to Dr. Richard Nuccitelli under his
written employment agreement, which has an annual salary amount of $200,000. If
we engage the Frank Reidy Center at Old Dominion University for additional
research as the company engaged them in the past under a research funding
agreement, then the company will use a portion of the proceeds of this offering
for that purpose; however, at this time there are no specific plans in place to
engage the center for these services.

Pending their use, we plan to invest our net proceeds from this offering in
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States
government.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, combined with our existing
cash resources, will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements
for at least 12 months subsequent to the closing of the offering. Until we are
able to generate sustainable revenues that generate a profit, we expect to
finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt
financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. Such
additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all,
particularly in light of recent market conditions. If we raise funds by issuing
equity securities, the ownership of our stockholders will be diluted and the new
equity securities may have priority rights over our existing stockholders."

discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and
excluding any proceeds from the anticipated term loan under the proposed loan
and security agreement we intend to enter into upon consummation of this
offering or from other debt financing and/or strategic partnerships.

Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, based upon our
current operating plan, and assuming successful completion of this offering and
our success in securing a combination of debt financing and/or strategic
partnerships, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet the following
milestones, with respect to our current urea cycle disorder therapeutic
programs:

• achieve preclinical proof of concept for the treatment of a second urea cycle
  disorder;                                                            

• select a urea cycle disorder product candidate for further development;

• scale up the manufacturing of the lead urea cycle disorder product candidate;

• complete GMP-manufacturing and GLP-compliant toxicology studies; and

• file an IND application with the FDA for this product candidate.

In furtherance of the foregoing, we intend to use the net proceeds of this
offering as follows:

• approximately $459,000 to achieve preclinical proof of concept for the

  further development;                                                   

• approximately $11.6 million to scale up the manufacturing of the lead urea 
  cycle disorder product candidate; and

  toxicology studies.                                                        

In addition, we intend to use $440,000 of the net proceeds of this offering to
pay off the outstanding original issuance discount promissory note, dated May 2,
2016, in the aggregate amount of $440,000, which we issued in exchange for a
$400,000 loan used for working capital. The note matures on the earlier of (1)
December 21, 2016, (2) us completing a financing pursuant to which we receive
gross proceeds of at least $3.0 million or (3) upon an event of default under
such note.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will use
approximately $1.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering for additional
scale up of the manufacturing of the lead urea cycle disorder product candidate
and the remaining $1.6 million for general corporate purposes including working
capital requirements.

Even with the expected net proceeds from this offering, we do not expect to have
sufficient cash to complete the clinical development of any of our product
candidates or, if applicable, to prepare for commercializing any product
candidate that is approved.

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plan and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering. We
will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds in the
category of “for general corporate purposes and to fund ongoing operations and
expansion of our business,” and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. For example, if we
identify opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our
stockholders, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
acquire, invest in or license complementary products, technologies or businesses
although we have no current commitments, understandings or agreements to do so.
Depending on the outcome of our business activities and other unforeseen events,
our plans and priorities may change and we may apply the net proceeds of this
offering in different proportions than we currently anticipate.

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering as described above, we intend to

investment-grade securities or certificates of deposit."

$19.0 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
from the sale of the common stock offered by us, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and
excluding any proceeds from the anticipated term loan under the proposed loan
and security agreement we intend to enter into upon consummation of this
offering or from other debt financing and/or strategic partnerships.

Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, based upon our
current operating plan, and assuming successful completion of this offering and
our success in securing a combination of debt financing and/or strategic
partnerships, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet the following
milestones, with respect to our current urea cycle disorder therapeutic
programs:

• achieve preclinical proof of concept for the treatment of a second urea cycle
  disorder;                                                            

• select a urea cycle disorder product candidate for further development;

• scale up the manufacturing of the lead urea cycle disorder product candidate;

• complete GMP-manufacturing and GLP-compliant toxicology studies; and

• file an IND application with the FDA for this product candidate.

In furtherance of the foregoing, we intend to use the net proceeds of this
offering as follows:

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $20.0 million to advance clinical development of ONS-3010

  activities, including advancing development of ONS-1045 to be ready to enter a

  be ready to enter Phase 1 clinical trials; and
 
. the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 
However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process,
it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds
from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. Our management will
have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering. The
amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors
including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and
success of preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical
trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions and
the amount of cash obtained through current and any future collaborations.
We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies,
medicines or technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may
use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

. for general corporate and working capital purposes.

Even if we sell all of the securities subject to this offering, we will still
need to obtain additional financing in the future in order to fully fund our
business through the FDA regulatory approval process. We may elect to seek such
additional financing through public or private equity or debt offerings or other
sources, including collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners
or through refinancing and/or increasing the lines of credit under our existing
debt facilities. There can be no assurance we will be able to obtain such
additional financing or that such additional financing will be on terms that are
favorable to us. Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net
proceeds of this offering as described above, there may be circumstances where a
reallocation of funds may be necessary. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts, the progress of our clinical studies,
whether or not we enter into strategic collaborations or partnerships and our
operating costs and expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering.

The costs and timing of regulatory approval, particularly conducting clinical
studies, are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial risks and can often
change. Accordingly, we may change the allocation of use of these proceeds as a
result of contingencies such as the progress and results of our clinical studies
and other development activities, the establishment of collaborations, our
manufacturing requirements and regulatory or competitive developments.

Pending the application of the net proceeds as described above or otherwise, we
may invest the proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
securities or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government or other securities."

Concurrent Private Placements of approximately US$58.5 million, or approximately
US$64.9 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
ADSs in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placements
primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include investing in sales
and marketing activities, course development, technology infrastructure, capital
expenditures and other general and administrative matters. We may also use a
portion of the net proceeds for investing in, or acquiring, complementary
businesses, although we have not identified any near-term investment or
acquisition targets. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary
depending on the amount of cash generated by our operations, and the rate of
growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering and the
Concurrent Private Placements. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent
Private Placements differently than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placements, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding
to our PRC subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions, and to our
PRC consolidated VIE only through loans, and only if we satisfy the applicable
government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to meet these requirements on a timely basis, if at all. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, financial instruments or demand deposits."

proceeds do not include any proceeds that we may receive from the exercise of
warrants included in the units.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate future access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to
use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to fund the commercialization
and continued development of the SRT-100 product line and other products as
follows:

• approximately $3.0 million for the expansion of our sales and marketing 
  activities, including hiring new sales representatives and a director of   
  marketing;

  conversion, in each case who have not elected to convert such dividend into
  shares of our common stock at the initial public offering price attributable 
  to the common stock within 30 days following the closing of this offering; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

In addition, we may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire and invest
in complementary products, technologies, services or businesses. We are
exploring the possibility of reducing our reliance on third party manufacturers
by bringing certain manufacturing, service and research and development
functions in-house, which could include the acquisition of equipment and other
fixed assets or the acquisition or lease of a manufacturing facility. However,
we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transactions
nor are we involved in negotiations to do so.

intentions based upon our plans and business condition. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the

that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing
of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors,
including the factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” in this
prospectus. As a result, management will have broad discretion in its
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
in such application.

the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,
based upon the initial public offering price of $7.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $15.0 million to complete our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of
  CLS-1001 in uveitis patients; 

• approximately $14.0 million to initiate and begin conducting our Phase 3
  clinical program for CLS-1003 in RVO patients; 

• approximately $6.0 million to prepare our IND for, and complete our planned
  Phase 1/2 clinical trial of, CLS-1002 in wet AMD patients; and 

• the remainder to fund continued research and development of our earlier-stage
  programs, including drug discovery for potential new applications for our SCS
  microinjection technology, and for working capital and other general corporate
  purposes.

In the ordinary course of our business, we expect to from time to time evaluate
the acquisition of, investment in or in-license of complementary products,
technologies or businesses, and we could use a portion of the net proceeds from
this offering for such activities. We currently do not have any agreements,
arrangements or commitments with respect to any potential acquisition,
investment or license.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Predicting the cost
necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult and we anticipate that
we will need additional funds to complete our planned Phase 3 clinical program
for CLS-1003 in RVO patients. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures
may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of
our development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. The
timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business.
Pending these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest
bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or
direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States. The goal with respect to
the investment of these net proceeds is capital preservation and liquidity so
that such funds are readily available to fund our operations."

approximately $10.7 million if we sell all 2,000,000 shares of our common stock
in this offering. However, this is a best efforts offering and there is no
assurance that we will sell any shares or receive any proceeds.

We intend to use the proceeds from this offering as follows:

(1) If we complete the maximum offering, we estimate that we will have
    sufficient funds to complete the majority of the Phase II clinical trials
    for Annamycin. If we complete the minimum offering, we estimate that we will
    require additional financing of at least $1.1 million to complete the trial
    plus such additional working capital to fund our operations during the
    pendency of the trial. The timing and costs of clinical trials are difficult
    to predict and as such the foregoing estimates may prove to be inaccurate.

(2) Includes approximately $1.1 million representing outstanding license fees
    and past due obligations to MD Anderson and other deferred obligations to
    certain vendors.

We believe the net proceeds of this offering, together with our and Moleculin’s
cash and cash equivalents, including the remaining proceeds from our recent
private placement of our 8% unsecured promissory notes, will be sufficient to
meet our cash, operational and liquidity requirements for at least 12 months if
we sell a minimum of 1,400,000 shares and for at least 16 months if we sell all
2,000,000 shares of our common stock in this offering.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. Accordingly, our
management will have broad discretion in the application of these proceeds. Net
offering proceeds not immediately applied to the uses summarized above will be
invested in short-term investments such as money market funds, commercial paper,
U.S. treasury bills and similar securities investments pending their use."

obligations of the U.S. government. We cannot predict whether the invested
proceeds will yield a favorable return."
