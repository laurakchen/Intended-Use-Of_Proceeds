approximately $53.6 million, or approximately $62.2 million if the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting underwriting 
discount and other estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to obtain additional equity capital,
create a public market for our ordinary shares represented by ADSs, and 
facilitate future access to public markets. We expect to use the net proceeds 
from this offering, together with available funds, for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures relating to the 
expansion of our operations and potential acquisitions. The timing and size 
of our particular capital expenditure needs may change rapidly in response to 
perceived market opportunities, technological changes and actions by our 
competitors and, therefore, our management is currently unable to allocate 
any specific portions of the net proceeds for particular uses. We do not 
currently have any agreements or understanding to make any material 
acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses.

Pending our use of the net proceeds we receive from this offering, we intend 
to invest our net proceeds in short-term, investment grade, debt securities or 
to deposit the proceeds into interest-bearing bank accounts. These investments 
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences 
of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a PFIC for 
U.S. federal income taxpayers, which could result in negative tax consequences 
to you."

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from an advance of
      $100,000 we received from Thomas Chan-Soo Kang described below. These
      advances will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being
      placed in the trust account upon consummation of this offering.

(2)   These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
      of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.

(3)   The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in the trust account
      will remain constant at $50,000 even if the underwriters' over-allotment is
      exercised. In addition, $1.5 million of interest income earned on the
      amounts held in the trust account will be available to us to pay for our
      working capital requirements. If the size of this offering is increased, the
      amount of interest income earned on the trust account that can be released
      to us to fund our working capital will be increased proportionately. For
      purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the
      total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the
      offering.

(4)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
      items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
      incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
      connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based
      upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
      anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
      fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
      fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
      category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

A total of approximately $50.0 million (or approximately $57.3 million if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds 
from this offering and the sale of the sponsors’ warrants described in this 
prospectus, including $2.0 million (or $2.3 million if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts 
and commissions will be placed in the trust account at HSBC (London) maintained 
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. Except for a portion 
of the interest income that may be released to us, the proceeds held in trust 
will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of the approval 
of the extended period, if any, the completion of our initial business 
combination or our liquidation. All amounts held in the trust account that are 
not paid to public shareholders who elect to exercise their conversion rights or 
released to us as interest income will be released on closing of our initial 
business combination with one or more target businesses which collectively have 
a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account 
(excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.0 million or 
$2.3 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at 
the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such business 
combination, subject to a majority of our public shareholders voting in favor of 
the business combination and less than 40% of the public shareholders electing 
their conversion rights (on a cumulative basis including any ordinary shares 
converted in connection with a vote on the extended period) and subject to such 
deferred underwriting discount and commission having been paid to the 
underwriters. On release of funds from the trust account and after payment of 
the conversion price to any public shareholders who exercise their conversion 
rights, the underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and 
commissions, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to 
pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with 
which our initial combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for 
using stock or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the 
trust account to general corporate purposes, including for the maintenance or 
expansion of operations of the acquired business or businesses, the payment of 
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial 
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working 
capital.

If the size of this offering is increased, the amount of interest income earned
on the trust account that can be released to us to fund our working capital will
be increased proportionately.

We have agreed to pay Kang & Company, Ltd., an affiliate of Messrs. Kang, Kim,
Morrison, Rittenberg, and Sang-Uh Han an aggregate of $10,000 per month for
office space, administrative services and secretarial support. This arrangement
is being agreed to us by Kang & Company, Ltd. for our benefit and is not
intended to provide Messrs. Kang, Kim, Morrison, Rittenberg or Sang-Uh Han
compensation in lieu of a salary or other remuneration. We believe that such
fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated
person based on rents and fees for similar services in the ROK. Upon completion
of a business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of the members of our management team and may include engaging
market research firms and/or third party consultants. Members of our management
team, or their affiliates or associates, will not receive any compensation for
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for
any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with
such due diligence activities. Our audit committee will review and approve all
expense reimbursements made to any member of our management team and any expense
reimbursements payable to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and
approved by our Board of Directors, with the interested director or directors
abstaining from such review and approval.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account as well as the interest
income earned on the trust account balance released to us to pay any tax
obligations and interest income of up to $1.5 million earned on the trust
account balance that may be released to us will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. However, if our estimate of
the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently not ascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us.

If we complete a business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
members of our management team prior to the business combination's closing will
become an obligation of the post-combination business, assuming these
out-of-pocket expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing. These
expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would be
treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined
business. Members of our management team may, as part of any such combination,
negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the target
business' owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our management
team to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in a
conflict of interest.

To the extent that our capital shares are used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business'
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders' fees which we had incurred prior to the
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of
the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, Thomas Chan-Soo Kang has advanced to us an
aggregate of $100,000 which was used to pay a portion of the SEC registration
fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange
fee and accounting and legal fees and expenses of this offering referenced in
the line items above. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are
due at the earlier of December 12, 2008 or the consummation of this offering.
The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed
in the trust account.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Interest income earned on the trust account balance may be released to us
to pay any tax obligations and interest income of up to $1.5 million earned on
the trust account balance may be released to us to fund our working capital
requirements.

Other than the fee for office space, administrative services and secretarial
support described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder's and
consulting fees) will be paid to members of our management team or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination. However, members of our
management team will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest income that is released
to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be
reimbursed by us prior to our consummation of a business combination. There is
no limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us to members of our
management team. A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the
trust account only in the event of our liquidation if we fail to complete a
business combination within the allotted time or if the public shareholder
converts such shares into cash in connection with a business combination or a
shareholder vote on the extended period that the public shareholder voted
against and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will a public
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust
account.

On completion of our initial business combination, the underwriters will receive
the deferred underwriters' discounts and commissions held in the trust account.
If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee must
therefore distribute the balance in the trust account, the underwriters have
agreed (i) on our liquidation, they will forfeit any rights or claims to the
deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued interest
thereon, then in the trust account, and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to
distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with
any accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, to
the public shareholders on a pro rata basis."

(1) Excludes the payment of $100 from the underwriters for their unit purchase
    option, and the proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee 
    and FINRA filing fee, has been paid from loans in the aggregate amount of 
    $32,434 made to us by one of our officers and an affiliate of one of our 
    directors, as further described below. These funds will be repaid out of 
    the net proceeds of this offering not being deposited in the trust 
    account upon consummation of this offering.

(3) Represents 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 6,875,000 units 
    in this offering ($1,100,000).

(4) Represents 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of 6,875,000 units 
    ($1,100,000) that will be deposited into the trust account and paid to 
    the underwriters only upon consummation of a business combination and then
    only with respect to those units as to which the component subunits have 
    not been redeemed. If a business combination is not consummated and we 
    are liquidated, such amounts will be distributed among our public 
    shareholders. In addition, in the event of a business combination, the 
    amount of deferred underwriting discount payable to the underwriters will 
    take priority over other amounts in the trust account.

(5) A non-accountable expense allowance of 2% of the gross proceeds of this 
    offering, or $1,100,000, all of which will be held in the trust account 
    and will be payable to the underwriters only upon the consummation of a 
    business combination and then only with respect to those units as to 
    which the component subunits have not been redeemed. If a business 
    combination is not consummated and we are liquidated, such amounts will 
    be distributed among our public shareholders. In addition, in the event 
    of a business combination, the amount of deferred non-accountable expense
    allowance payable to the underwriters will take priority over other 
    amounts in the trust account.

Of the net proceeds of this offering, an aggregate of $54,300,000 including: 
(i) $1,000,000 from the purchase of private placement warrants and 
(ii) $2,200,000 of the proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ discount 
and non-accountable allowance will be deposited into the trust account at 
Goldman Sachs in London, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust 
Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released 
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business 
combination or as part of any liquidation of our trust account. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, i  n order to fund our working capital (including expenses 
in seeking business combinations and, potentially, the costs of our liquidation
and dissolution),$100,000 will initially be held outside of the trust account
and we will be permitted to draw, as earned, all of the cumulative interest 
earned on the funds held in the trust account, after taxes, in our discretion 
from time to time, which we estimate will be approximately $2,000,000.

To the extent the trust account earns interest or we are deemed to have 
earned income in connection therewith, we will be permitted to seek 
disbursements from the trust account to pay any federal, state, local or 
franchise tax obligations related thereto. The proceeds held in the trust 
account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target 
acquisition with which we complete a business combination (excluding the 
amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the underwriters’ 
discount and non-accountable). Any amounts not paid as consideration to the 
sellers of the target business will be used to finance our operations, which 
may include the target business(es) we acquired on the consummation of the 
business combination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, 
as determined by our board of directors at that time.

All amounts held in the trust account that are not redeemed for cash or 
released to us as interest income, net of income taxes, will be released on 
closing of our initial business combination with a target acquisition having a 
fair market value equal to at least the 80% net asset threshold, subject to a 
majority of our public shareholders voting at the meeting in favor of the 
business combination and less than 35% of the public shareholders voting 
against the business combination, and the extended period, collectively, and 
electing their redemption rights. The 35% threshold is 20% in most similar 
entities. See “Risk Factors—Unlike many other blank check offerings, when we 
submit our initial business combination to our shareholders for approval we 
will allow up to one  ordinary  share less than 35% of our public shareholders
to exercise their redemption rights. The ability of a larger number of our 
shareholders to exercise their redemption rights may not allow us to 
consummate the most desirable business combination or optimize our 
capital structure.”

We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $7,500 to Chardan Capital, LLC, an 
affiliate of Li Zhang, chairman of our board of directors, for office space 
and general and administrative services, including but not limited to 
receptionist, secretarial and general office services. This agreement 
commences on the date of this prospectus and shall continue until the earliest
to occur of: (i) the consummation of a business combination,(ii) _________, 
2010  [30 months from the date of this prospectus]  and (iii) the date on 
which we cease our corporate existence in accordance with our restated 
and amended memorandum and articles of association.

We intend to use the $100,000 of net proceeds from the private placement not 
held in the trust account and all of the interest generated on the funds in 
the trust account, which we estimate to be approximately $2.0 million, for a 
portion of our due diligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the 
acquisition including investment banking fees, and other expenses, including 
structuring and negotiating the business combination, as well as a possible 
down payment,  reverse break up fees (a provision in a merger agreement which 
requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition 
is not obtained)  , lock-up or “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of 
intent designed to keep target acquisitions from “shopping” around for 
transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target 
acquisitions), if necessary, to bear the costs of liquidation if in the event 
we are unable to effect a business combination by ,         2010  [30 months 
from the date of this prospectus]. While we do not have any current intention
to use these funds as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision with 
respect to a particular proposed business combination, if we were to enter 
into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive 
exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount that would be used as a 
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on 
the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our 
available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a 
result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient 
funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to,
potential target acquisitions. In addition to the use of funds described above,
we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to consultants to assist
us with our search for a target acquisition. We believe that the $100,000 
initially held outside of the trust account together with all of the interest
income generated from the trust account, which we estimate to be 
approximately $2,000,000, will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses.

To the extent that our unissued authorized shares or debt securities are used 
in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, or in 
the event that indebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, 
as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the 
trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be 
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds 
not expended, be used as working capital to finance our operations. In the 
event that third party indebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and 
directors would not be personally liable for the repayment of such 
indebtedness.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with a 
business combination, either because the consideration for the business 
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we 
finance a portion of the consideration with our unissued authorized shares 
or debt securities. In such event, the proceeds held in the trust account as 
well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance our 
operations, which may include the target business(es) that we acquire on or 
after the business combination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working 
capital, as determined by our board of directors at that time. We may use 
these funds, among other things, for director and officer compensation, 
change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to finance the 
operations of the target acquisition, to make other acquisitions and to 
pursue our growth strategy.

One of our officers and an affiliate of one of our directors have advanced to 
us a total of $32,434, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of 
this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fees, 
FINRA registration fees, Nasdaq Capital Market filing fees and legal and audit 
fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier 
of September 30, 2008, or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be 
repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not held in trust.

The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trust account 
agent only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of 
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 
days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 
2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the 
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being 
deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act 
of 1940. Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with 
the requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distribute the trust 
account to holders of our ordinary shares sold in this offering until after 
our existence terminates and, consequently, we may be deemed to be an 
investment company and thus required to comply with such act. We do not believe
that the fees and expenses for due diligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, 
down payment, lock-up or other activities related to this offering or our 
business combination will exceed $2,100,000 in the aggregate. Based upon the 
experience of the members of our board and consultation with them regarding 
a reasonable budget for consummating a transaction of this kind and nature, 
and a review of budgets publicly disclosed by blank-check companies, we 
determined that this was an appropriate approximation of the expenses. If 
costs are higher than expected we might not have sufficient funds to continue 
searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, any potential target 
acquisitions. In such case, we would need to obtain additional funds from our 
existing shareholders or another source to continue operations. We believe 
that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient available 
funds to operate for at least the next 30 months, assuming that a business 
combination is not consummated during that time.

No compensation of any kind (including finders, consulting or other similar 
fees) will be paid to any of our existing shareholders, officers or directors,
or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services that they render in 
order to effectuate, or in connection with the consummation of the business 
combination. However, such persons will receive reimbursement, subject to 
board approval, for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection 
with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target 
acquisitions, performing business due diligence on suitable target 
acquisitions and business combinations, as well as traveling to and from the 
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target acquisitions to 
examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us 
out of the funds not held in the trust account and currently allocated in the 
above table to “Legal, accounting and other expenses,” “Due diligence of 
prospective target businesses” and “Working capital.” Since the role of 
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no 
ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons 
after a business combination.

A public shareholder (but not our existing shareholders with respect to any 
of our ordinary shares owned immediately before this offering or underlying 
the insider warrants or the private placement warrants purchased in the 
private placement) will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on such shareholder’s portion of the trust account, 
net of taxes payable and amounts of trust account interest we are permitted to 
draw for working capital) only in the event of our liquidation of the trust 
account as part of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business 
combination, or if such public shareholder redeem their ordinary shares for 
cash in connection with a business combination, or the extended period, that 
the public shareholder voted against and which we actually approved and with 
respect to a business combination is consummated. In no other circumstances 
will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the 
trust account. Our existing shareholders, directors and officers are not 
entitled to redeem any of their ordinary shares acquired prior to this offering
for a cash portion of the trust account.

Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be 
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the 
underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance held in the 
trust account, less $0.32 per share for each ordinary share redeemed by the 
public shareholders. In the event that we are unable to consummate a business 
combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account, the 
underwriters have agreed that: (i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to 
such proceeds; and (ii) the proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ 
discount and non-accountable expense allowance will be distributed on a 
pro rata basis among the public shareholders along with any accrued interest 
thereon."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been or
    will be paid from the funds we received from Chien Lee and Sylvia Lee
    described below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this
    offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts
    are reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of
    the offering. An additional $864,000, or $993,600 if the over-allotment
    option is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in trust
    following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the underwriters
    only if and when we consummate a business combination.

(3) The miscellaneous expenses are anticipated to be allocated for ""road show""
    and other expenses (such as mailing and distribution charges) incurred by or
    on our behalf. To the extent not used for such purposes, any remainder will
    be received by us and included in our working capital following the
    offering.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $150,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, $1,050,000 of interest
    income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available 
    to us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of 
    presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount
    of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, CS Capital USA, Bill 
Haus, James Preissler, Peter Li and William B. Heyn have committed to purchase 
the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $1,660,000, or 
$1,804,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) from us. These 
purchases will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the 
consummation of this offering. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with 
respect to the purchase of the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive 
from this purchase will be placed in the trust account described below.

$26,948,000, or $31,095,200 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,660,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Merrill
Lynch, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts
and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters
have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The funds
held in trust will be invested only in United States ""government securities""
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Except with respect to interest income that may be released to us
of (i) up to $1,050,000 to fund expenses related to investigating and selecting
a target business and our other working capital requirements and (ii) any
additional amounts we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations, the
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. If the underwriters
determine the size of the offering should be increased or decreased, such an
increase or decrease in offering size could also result in a proportionate
increase or decrease in the amount of interest we may withdraw from the trust
account. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to CS Capital USA, an affiliate of Chien Lee, our chairman of the
board and chief executive officer, and Sylvia Lee, our president, chief
financial officer, secretary and member of our board of directors, of a monthly
fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by CS
Capital USA for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Lee or Ms. Lee
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the Miami, Florida metropolitan area, that the fee charged
by CS Capital USA is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a
business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
shareholders. Other than the $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder's, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to
""Legal, accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the search for
target businesses and to the due diligence investigation, structuring and
negotiation of a business combination,"" ""Due diligence of prospective target
businesses by our officers, directors and existing shareholders"" and ""Working
capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate
purposes, liquidation obligations and reserves."" Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $150,000. In addition, interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $1,050,000, may be released
to us to fund our working capital requirements. We intend to use the excess
working capital (approximately $325,000) for director and officer liability
insurance premiums (approximately $120,000), with the balance of $205,000 being
held in reserve for tax payments and in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing shareholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We will also be entitled to have
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any
tax obligations that we may owe. We believe these funds will be sufficient to
cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of
the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us with
our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop""
provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses
from ""shopping"" around for transactions with other companies on terms more
favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If
we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down
payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision would be determined based on the terms
of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business'
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders' fees which we had incurred prior to the
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of
the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, certain of our initial shareholders have agreed
to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to
seek repayment of such expenses.

Chien Lee and Sylvia Lee have advanced to us a total of $135,000 which was used
to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items
above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and
audit fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the
earlier of October 15, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loans will
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of
offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 30 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our automatic liquidation and dissolution or if that public
shareholder redeems such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public shareholder voted against and which we consummate.
In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account."

$144,860,500, based upon the initial public offering price of $12.50 per share, 
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full, the net proceeds to us will be approximately $167,006,125. We will 
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling 
stockholders. The selling stockholders include certain of our executive officers 
and members of our board of directors or entities affiliated with or controlled by 
them.

Currently our primary sources of capital are cash generated from operating 
activities, equipment financing arrangements with vendor-related leasing 
companies, and funds available under our revolving line of credit. We intend to 
use the net proceeds from this offering to supplement these existing sources of 
capital primarily to finance our growth plans, as well as for working capital 
and general corporate purposes. However, we have not allocated any portion of 
net proceeds from this offering for any specific purpose and have no agreements 
or commitments with respect to the use of such proceeds. We currently anticipate 
making aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $335 million in 2008, 
$160 million of which is expected to be allocated for construction contracts for 
our new corporate headquarters in the San Antonio, Texas area and expansion of 
data center facilities in the U.S. and the U.K., with the remaining $175 million 
expected to be allocated for purchases of IT equipment.  However, we may 
accelerate or postpone those expenditures to align our asset base with the need 
to support our customers and to exploit opportunities to acquire assets. The 
timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, 
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business.

Initially, we may choose to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering 
to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit. The 
borrowing costs of this revolving line of credit are determined by London 
Inter-bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin spread. This spread 
starts at 0.675% and goes up to 1.550% based on our amount of leverage, which is 
defined as the ratio of funded debt to our EBITDA, as defined in the credit 
agreement. The initial term of the revolving line of credit expires in August 
2012. Because we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional 
amount of $50.0 million maturing on December 10, 2010, we do not currently 
expect to reduce our outstanding borrowings in the near future to an amount 
below $50.0 million. We have not identified any specific circumstances under 
which we will repay all or any portion of the line credit using the proceeds 
from this offering. As of March 31, 2008, outstanding indebtedness under our 
credit facility totaled approximately $77.3 million. Proceeds from our line of credit have been used, 
along with cash generated from operating activities and equipment financing 
arrangements with vendor-related leasing companies, to fund our capital 
expenditures. We intend to keep the credit facility in place after the offering 
to have access to sufficient liquidity to execute our growth plans.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, 
technologies, or other assets. We do not, however, have agreements or 
commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time.

Pending the uses mentioned above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this 
offering in short-term, interest bearing, investment grade securities."

US$42.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us, based on the initial public offering 
price of US$6.80 per ADS.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering primarily for the 
following purposes:

. approximately US$10.0 million to increase our sales, marketing and production 
  capabilities;

. approximately US$30.0 million to fund our potential acquisitions of 
  complementary media businesses; and

. the remaining amount to fund our working capital, including the capital needed 
  to expand our available advertising time slots on television networks, our 
  purchase of the premises occupied by our corporate headquarters and other 
  general corporate purposes.

We do not currently have any agreements or understandings with third parties to 
make any material acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses.

Depending on future events and other changes in the business climate, we may 
determine at a later time to use the net proceeds for different purposes. 
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds to us in short-term 
bank deposits, direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government or other 
short-term money market instruments. These investments may have a material 
adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in 
our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a passive foreign investment company 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could result in adverse tax 
consequences for you."

As reflected in the table above, we expect that the net proceeds to be retained 
by Home Bancorp will range from $21.0 million to $33.0 million. Home Bancorp 
intends to invest 100% of the proceeds it retains from the offering initially 
in short-term, liquid investments. Although there can be no assurance that Home 
Bancorp will invest the net proceeds in anything other than short-term, liquid 
investments, over time, Home Bancorp may use the proceeds it retains from the 
offering:

. support the future expansion of operations through establishment of additional
  branch offices or other customer facilities for Home Bank, acquisition of other
  financial institutions or branch offices, expansion into other lending markets 
  or diversification into other banking related businesses, although no such 
  acquisitions are specifically being considered at this time;

. invest in securities or place funds on deposit with Home Bank;

. fund repurchases of our common stock or serve as a source of possible payments
  of cash dividends;

. for general corporate purposes.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, Home Bancorp may not 
repurchase shares of its common stock during the first year following the 
conversion, except to fund equity benefit plans or, with prior regulatory 
approval, when extraordinary circumstances exist. We do not anticipate making 
any stock repurchases during the first year after our conversion except to 
fund our stock recognition and retention plan upon approval by shareholders.

The portion of net proceeds to be contributed to Home Bank is expected to range 
from $27.9 million to $43.7 million. Home Bank intends to initially use the net 
proceeds it receives to purchase investment securities. In the future, Home 
Bank may use the proceeds that it receives from the offering, which is shown in 
the table above as the amount contributed to Home Bank:

. to fund new loans;
	 
. to invest in securities;

. to finance the possible expansion of its banking franchise, including 
  developing new branch locations; and

. for general corporate purposes.

We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed 
above.

We expect to expand the geographic market we serve by opening new branch 
offices in the greater Baton Rouge market and other markets which are 
contiguous to our current offices. Other than these anticipated uses, we have 
not specifically quantified the amounts involved for the net proceeds to be 
contributed to Home Bank. Initially, the bulk of the net proceeds to the bank 
will be invested in securities. In time, we expect a greater amount of the 
proceeds will be utilized to fund new loan originations.

Except as described above, neither Home Bancorp nor Home Bank has any specific 
plans for the investment of the proceeds of this offering and has not allocated
a specific portion of the proceeds to any particular use."
