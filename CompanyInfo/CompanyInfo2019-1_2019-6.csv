$257.6 million, after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and
commissions. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
Class A shares in full, we expect the estimated net proceeds to be approximately
$297.2 million.

We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to NFI in exchange for
NFI’s issuance to us of NFI LLC Units. NFI intends to use the net proceeds from
this offering in the following manner: approximately (i) $20 million to complete
the construction of the Old Harbour Terminal, (ii) $100 million to partially
fund the construction of the CHP Plant, (iii) $30 million to partially fund the
construction of the La Paz Terminal, (iv) $100 million to complete the
construction of the San Juan Facility and (v) the remainder for general company
purposes, including potential development of additional liquefiers and
downstream facilities in the future. We will need an additional approximately
(i) $30 million to complete the construction of the CHP Plant and (ii) $80
million to complete the construction of the La Paz Terminal. We intend to use a
combination of cash on hand and additional borrowings under our Term Loan
Facility to complete the construction of the CHP Plant and the La Paz Terminal.
If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Class A shares
in full, the additional net proceeds will be approximately $39.6 million. The
net proceeds from any exercise of such option will be contributed to NFI in
exchange for NFI’s issuance to us of NFI LLC Units. After the application of the
net proceeds from this offering, we will own a 12.0% membership interest in NFI
(or a 13.5% membership interest if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional Class A shares is exercised in full). 

Pending any use, the net proceeds of this offering may be invested in
short-term, interest-bearing investment-grade securities."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a
    loan from an affiliate of our sponsor of an aggregate of $125,000 as
    described in this prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon completion of
    this offering.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the
    completion of our initial business combination, $7,000,000, which
    constitutes the underwriters deferred commissions (or $8,050,000 if the
    underwriters’ option to purchase additional units is exercised in full) will
    be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The
    remaining funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming
    stockholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion
    of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial
    business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including
    payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with
    our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies
    or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any
    interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account to pay taxes. Our actual expenditures
    for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth
    herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than
    our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our
    initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such
    business combination. In the event we identify a business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.

(5) The amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from
    the trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested
    only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or
    less or in money market funds meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7(d) under
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
    treasury obligations. We estimate the after-tax interest earned on the trust
    account will be approximately $3,000,000 per year, assuming an interest rate
    of 1.5% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this
    amount.

(6) This could include payment of consulting, finder or success fees to our
    sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates for assisting us in
    consummating our initial business combination.

Of the $201,000,000 in net proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale
of the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $231,000,000
in net proceeds if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units is
exercised in full, $200,000,000 ($10.00 per unit), or $230,000,000 if the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional units is exercised in full ($10.00
per unit), will be deposited into a trust account with Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $1,000,000 in each case will be
used for working capital following this offering. The proceeds held in the trust
account may be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting the conditions of
Rule 2a-7(d) under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate the after-tax interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $3,000,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 1.5% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding
this amount. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
our tax obligations, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable
to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing
of this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our
public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to
approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of
our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination
within 18 months from the closing of this offering. Based on current interest
rates, we expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to
pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. Additionally, Pivotal Spac Funding LLC, a managing member
of our sponsor, has agreed, pursuant to a forward purchase contract with us, to
purchase, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the consummation of
our initial business combination, up to $150,000,000 of our securities. The
funds, if any, from the sale of securities pursuant to this agreement may be
used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business
combination or may be used for working capital in the post-transaction company.
The type and amount of securities to be purchased by Pivotal Spac Funding LLC
will be determined by us and Pivotal Spac Funding LLC at the time we enter into
the definitive agreement for the proposed business combination. This agreement
is independent of the percentage of stockholders electing to redeem their public
shares and may provide us with an increased minimum funding level for the
initial business combination. The agreement is also conditioned on our board of
directors, including Kevin Griffin, who is affiliated with Pivotal Spac Funding
LLC, having unanimously approved the proposed initial business combination.
Additionally, Pivotal Spac Funding LLC has no assets other than its interest in
our sponsor and we have not required it to reserve the assets necessary to
satisfy any obligations under the agreement. Accordingly, we may not receive any
proceeds from this agreement and may need to arrange alternate financing to
complete a business combination.

If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities,
or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of
the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used
for conversions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the
cash released from the trust account and proceeds of the forward purchase
contract for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans
in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, in addition to the interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us as described
above, will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds
are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin
preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication
of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the
circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that
addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
our sponsor, members of our management team or any of their affiliates, but such
persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Prior to the date of this prospectus, an affiliate of our sponsor has loaned us
$125,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is
non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of September 1, 2019,
the closing of this offering or if we determine to abandon this offering. The
loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the funds not held
in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor, officers or directors or
their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required
on an interest-free basis. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account
released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held
outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the
trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity
at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our
initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor, officers or directors or their affiliates as we do not believe
third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against
any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account."

(1) Approximately $48,869 of the offering expenses, including the SEC            
    registration fee, the FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the    
    Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid 
    from the funds we borrowed from B. Luke Weil described below. These funds    
    will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.
         
(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $750,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. Does not include up to $100,000 of  
    interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released  
    to us to pay for our working capital obligations, including any necessary
    liquidation or dissolution expenses. 
     
(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in    
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not   
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Certain of our initial shareholders, including the underwriters in this
offering, have agreed that they and their respective designees will purchase an
aggregate of 375,000 private units at a price of $10.00 per unit ($3,750,000 in
the aggregate) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the
closing of this offering. Certain of our initial shareholders have further
agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters, they
will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit an additional number of
private units (up to a maximum of 37,500 private units) pro rata with the amount
of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least $10.00 per share sold to
the public in this offering is held in trust regardless of whether the
over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. All of the proceeds we
receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below. 

$100,000,000, or $115,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account in the United States, maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in
trust will be invested only in United States government treasury bills, bonds or
notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States government
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax
obligations and up to $100,000 of interest that may be released to us to pay for
our working capital obligations, including any necessary liquidation or
dissolution expenses, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business. 

Other than the underwriting fees, the business combination marketing agreement
fees and the payment of consulting, finder or success fees to our officers,
directors, shareholders or their affiliates for assisting us in consummating our
initial business combination, no compensation of any kind will be paid to any of
our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the
consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us outside of trust for our working
capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be
approximately $750,000. In addition, up to $100,000 of the interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such
interest income) may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements.
We intend to use the excess working capital available for miscellaneous expenses
such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the
balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our initial shareholders, officers and directors in connection with
activities on our behalf as described above. We will also be entitled to have
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any
tax obligations that we may owe as well as up to $100,000 of interest to pay for
our working capital obligations, including any necessary liquidation or
dissolution expenses.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto,
including a fees payable to the joint book-running managers in this offering in
an aggregate amount equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering
(exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable) upon
consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection
with our initial business combination. If the payment of our liabilities were to 
reduce the amount available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish 
to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the 
trust account, we would not be able to consummate such transaction. To the 
extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to 
effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are
not used to consummate a business combination, to pay holders who wish to 
convert their shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account or 
pay our expenses relating thereto will be disbursed to the combined company and 
will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital 
to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds 
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, B. Luke Weil has agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $25,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses. 

As of September 30, 2018, B. Luke Weil had loaned us an aggregate of $48,869 to
be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for a portion of the legal expenses. The loans are payable without
interest on the earlier of (i) July 1, 2019, (ii) the date on which we
consummate our initial public offering or (iii) the date on which we determine
to not proceed with our initial public offering. The loans will be repaid out of
the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses. 

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the
units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the
holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial
business combination. In the event that the initial business combination does
not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account
would be used for such repayment. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations and less up
to $100,000 of interest we may use for our working capital obligations,
including any necessary liquidation or dissolution expenses) only in the event
of (i) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not
completed a business combination within the required time period, (ii) if that
public shareholder converts such public shares or sells them to us in a tender
offer in each case in connection with a business combination which we consummate
or (iii) in connection with an amendment to our memorandum and articles of
association prior to the consummation of an initial business combination. In no
other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account."

approximately $5.72 million (or approximately $6.71 million if the underwriters’
option to purchase additional common shares from us is exercised in full), after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions, non-accountable
expense allowance, and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The net
proceeds from this offering must be remitted to China before we will be able to
use the funds to grow our business. The procedure to remit funds may take
several months after completion of this offering, and we will be unable to use
the offering proceeds in China until remittance is completed.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows after we complete
the remittance process:

based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including any unforeseen cash needs. Similarly, the priority of our prospective
uses of proceeds will depend on business and market conditions are they develop.
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility and broad
discretion in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event
occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering
differently than as described in this prospectus. In utilizing the proceeds of
this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide

TCMP and Advanced TCMP products. Our goal is to use the net proceeds from this
offering to bring our four new product candidates RenShen, QingGuo, JueMingZi,

have enough capital from the proceeds of this Offering to fund development of
these five new product candidates through to commercialization.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of a loan
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. This
    amount will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held
    in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as 
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $8,750,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or $10,062,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

We may increase or decrease the total number of units sold to the public in this
offering. If we decide to proceed with an offering that results in an increase
in the total number of units sold to the public, we would have additional
proceeds from the offering available to pursue an acquisition. If we proceed
with an offering that results in a decrease in the total number of shares sold
to the public, we would have reduced proceeds from the offering available to
pursue an acquisition. Such an increase or decrease may impact the size of the
initial business combination we may pursue. In addition, the proceeds held in
trust would correspondingly increase or decrease such that 100% of the gross
proceeds from this offering will be held in trust. The underwriter’s option to
purchase additional units to cover over-allotments and the amount of private
placement warrants that our sponsor will purchase will correspondingly increase
or decrease. We would issue additional Class B common stock in the event we
increase the total number of units sold in this offering and the holders of our
Class B common stock would forfeit shares of Class B common stock in the event
we decrease the total number of units sold in this offering so that the number
of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of
Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20%
of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon
completion of this offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and
equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business
combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be
issued, to any seller in the business combination).

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $250,000,000 (or $287,500,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $8,750,000 (or
$10,062,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, with American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $2,500,000 per year,
assuming an interest rate of 1.00% per year; however, we can provide no
assurance regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24
months from the closing of this offering or (ii) with respect to any other
provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination
activity and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay our sponsor a
total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and
administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is
due at the earlier of March 31, 2019 or the closing of this offering. The loan
will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the offering proceeds
not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or
their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with
applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not 
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in 
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do 
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a 
going-private transaction subject to the going- private rules under the
Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such
purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

Our anchor investor has expressed to us an interest to purchase $32,500,000 of
units in this offering and we have agreed to direct the underwriters to sell to
our anchor investor such number of units. Further, our anchor investor has
agreed with us that, if it does not own 3,250,000 public shares (which amount
will be reduced on a pro rata basis if less than 25,000,000 units are sold in
this offering), at the time of any stockholder vote with respect to an initial
business combination or the business day immediately prior to the consummation
of our initial business combination, it will transfer to our sponsor a portion
of the 812,500 founder shares it purchased prior to this offering on a pro rata
basis; provided, however, that the anchor investor will not be obligated to
transfer to our sponsor any founder shares to the extent that its remaining
number of founder shares would be less than 203,125. There can be no assurance
that our anchor investor will acquire any units in this offering or what amount
of equity our anchor investor will retain, if any, upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. In the event that such anchor investor purchases
such units (either in this offering or after) and votes them in favor of our
initial business combination, it is possible that no votes from other public
stockholders would be required to approve our initial business combination,
depending on the number of shares that are present at the meeting to approve
such transaction. As a result of the founder shares and private placement
warrants that our anchor investor may hold, it may have different interests with
respect to a vote on an initial business combination than other public
stockholders.

Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has expressed to us an interest to
purchase $10,000,000 of units in this offering and we have agreed to direct the
underwriters to sell to him such number of units. There can be no assurance that
our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will acquire any units in this
offering.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described in this prospectus, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly
submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, and
(iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
business combination within 24 months following the closing of this offering,
subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations
(including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the
proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination and to waive their
redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in
connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering
or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or
pre-initial business combination activity. In addition, our initial stockholders
have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete
our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our
sponsor, anchor investor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. Permitted transferees of the founder shares held by our
sponsor, officers and directors or our anchor investor would be subject to the
same restrictions applicable to our sponsor, officers and directors or our
anchor investor, respectively."
"KALEIDO BIOSCIENCES, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/kaleido-biosciences-inc-1074432-88752,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/kaleido-biosciences-inc-1074432-88752,424B4,3/1/2019,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13269863,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of our
common stock in this offering will be approximately $66.9 million, or
approximately $77.3 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, based on the initial public offering price
of $15.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $60.0 million to advance our programs in hyperammonemia in
  Phase 2 clinical trials including related CMC and clinical trial material
  requirements;

• approximately $45.0 million to advance our pipeline outside of hyperammonemia,
  related product development, third-party costs and manufacturing for
  associated preclinical study, non-IND human clinical study and clinical trial
  materials;

• approximately $37.5 million to advance our proprietary product platform and
  discovery efforts; and

• the remainder, if any, for business development activities, working capital
  and other general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2018, we had $76.1 million of cash and cash equivalents on
hand. Based on our current plans, we believe our existing cash and cash
equivalents, together with the net proceeds from this offering, will be
sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
through the second half of 2020. With our existing cash and cash equivalents and
the net proceeds of this offering, we expect to be able to complete our planned
Phase 2 clinical trial of KB195 in UCD; complete our non-IND human clinical
study of KB195 in UCD; complete our two non-IND human clinical studies of KB174
in HE; file our IND in preparation for the initiation of any Phase 2 clinical
trial in HE; complete our planned non-IND human clinical study of KB109 in the
potential treatment of infection caused by multi-disease resistant bacteria in
high-risk patients; complete our planned non-IND human clinical study to support
our atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease program; and complete our planned
non-IND human clinical study in diabetes. We have based these estimates on
assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available
capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In any event, we will require
additional funding to be able to complete any Phase 2 clinical trial in HE and
we do not yet have any committed source of funding for this trial. We may
satisfy our future cash needs through the sale of equity securities, debt
financings, working capital lines of credit, corporate collaborations or license
agreements, grant funding, interest income earned on invested cash balances or a
combination of one or more of these sources.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds
to be received upon the completion of this offering. Due to uncertainties
inherent in the development process, it is difficult to estimate the exact
amounts of the net proceeds that will be used for any particular purpose. We may
use our existing cash, cash equivalents and the future payments, if any,
generated from any future collaboration agreements to fund our operations,
either of which may alter the amount of net proceeds used for a particular
purpose. In addition, the amount, allocation and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our
research and development efforts, the timing and success of non-IND human
clinical studies and clinical trials and the timing of regulatory submissions.
Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds.

Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    December 31, 2018, our sponsor had loaned us approximately $61,000 to cover
    offering expenses. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this
    offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
    for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting discounts and
    commissions) and amounts not to be held in the trust account. In the event
    that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such
    amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event
    that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may
    fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting discounts and commissions
    equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our
    initial business combination, $7,875,000, which constitutes the
    underwriters’ deferred underwriting discounts and commissions (or $9,056,250
    if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be
    paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the
    remaining funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming
    stockholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion
    of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial
    business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including
    payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with
    our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies
    or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any
    interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
    treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account
    will be approximately $2.25 million per year, assuming an interest rate of
    1% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
$225,000,000 (or $258,750,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including $7,875,000 (or $9,056,250 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions, will be deposited into a U.S. based trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $6,500,000 (or
$7,175,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full),
will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and
for working capital following this offering. The proceeds held in the trust
account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $2.25 million per year, assuming an
interest rate of 1% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding
this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of (a) the completion of our initial business combination
(including the release of funds to pay any amounts due to any public
stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights in connection
therewith), (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing
of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering
or (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we expect that the interest
earned on the trust account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to pay
Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans
in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us. 

We will reimburse our sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial support
and administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an
amount equal to $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
December 31, 2018, our sponsor had loaned us approximately $61,000 to cover
offering expenses. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due
at the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering as part of the estimated $1,000,000 of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business 
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise
price, exercisability and exercise period. Except as set forth above, the terms
of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist
with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business
combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor
or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account.

We have entered into a forward purchase agreement pursuant to which Atlas Point
Fund, which is a fund managed by CIBC National Trust but is not affiliated with
us or our sponsor, agreed to purchase up to an aggregate maximum amount of
$150,000,000 of either (i) a number of forward purchase units for $10.00 per
unit or (ii) a number of forward purchase shares for $9.67 per share, in a
private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of our initial
business combination. Whether we will issue Atlas Point Fund forward purchase
units valued at $10.00 per unit or forward purchase shares valued at $9.67 per
share will be determined at our election, and in our sole discretion, at least
10 business days prior to the closing of our initial business combination. Each
whole forward purchase warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of our Class
A common stock at $11.50 per share. The forward purchase warrants will have the
same terms as the public warrants and the forward purchase shares will be
identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the units being sold
in this offering, except the forward purchase shares and the forward purchase
warrants will be subject to transfer restrictions and certain registration
rights. The funds from the sale of the forward purchase securities may be used
as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination,
and any excess funds may be used for the working capital needs of the
post-transaction company. This agreement is independent of the percentage of
stockholders electing to redeem their public shares and may provide us with an
increased minimum funding level for the initial business combination. The
forward purchase agreement is subject to conditions, including Atlas Point Fund
giving us its irrevocable written consent to purchase the forward purchase
securities no later than five days after we notify it of our intention to meet
to consider entering into a definitive agreement for a proposed business
combination. Atlas Point Fund may grant or withhold its consent to the purchase
entirely within its sole discretion. Accordingly, if Atlas Point Fund does not
consent to the purchase, it will not be obligated to purchase the forward
purchase securities.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors, Atlas
Point Fund or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and the rules of the NYSE. However, they have no
current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have
not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage
in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
Subsequent to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt an insider
trading policy which will require insiders to: (1) refrain from purchasing
securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of
any material non-public information; and (2) to clear all trades with our legal
counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders
will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent
upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such
purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such
purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not
necessary.

We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a
tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. 

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the redemption of any public shares
properly submitted in connection with our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing
of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated
an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering or (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors and Atlas Point Fund have entered into a
letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held
by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder
shares held by them if we fail to complete our business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

stock in this offering will be approximately $22.4 million (or approximately
$25.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares of common stock from us in full), based on the initial public offering
price of $11.00 per share and after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend
to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for working capital and
general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, product
development and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net
proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or
businesses. However, we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into
any acquisitions or investments. Pending these uses, we may invest the net
proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing
securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial
paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.
 
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditure, including expenditure related
to sales and marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors,
including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing
activities, expansion internationally, the amount of cash generated or used by
our operations, competitive pressures and other factors. We therefore cannot
estimate the amount of net proceeds to be used for the purposes described above.
As a result, we may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for
other purposes. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of
the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds from this offering. Investors will not have an
opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we
base our decisions regarding the use of these proceeds."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.
 
(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor (directly or through its affiliates) of up to $400,000 as
    described in this prospectus. As of December 31, 2018, there was $283,754
    outstanding under such promissory note. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we
    borrowed an additional $75,000 under such promissory note. These loans will
    be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the offering proceeds that
    has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than
    underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account. In the event that
    offering expenses are less than as set forth in this table, any such amounts
    will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that
    the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund
    such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $10,500,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $12,075,000 if the underwriters’ option to
    purchase additional units is exercised in full) will be paid to the
    underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately
    $4,200,000 to be available to us annually from interest earned on the funds
    held in the trust account; however, we can provide no assurances regarding
    this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 1.4% per annum based
    upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be
    invested.
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.
 
The Nasdaq listing rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from
this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a
trust account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional units is exercised in full), including $10,500,000 (or up to
$12,075,000 if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the
consummation of this offering, be placed in a U.S. based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as
trustee. The funds in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds that
meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940
and that invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. Based on current
interest rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will
be approximately $4,200,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.4% per
year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held
in the trust account, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any. The
funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account
until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination;
(2) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(A) to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to provide for the
redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business
combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering
or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or
pre-initial business combination activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our
public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.
Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the trust
account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply
the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of
post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their respective affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation or
other duty to loan funds to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $37,000 per month for office
space, administrative, support and salaries to be paid to employees of such
affiliate for due diligence and related services in connection with our search
for a target company (although no salaries or fees will be paid from the monthly
fee to members of our management team). Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor (directly or through its
affiliates) has agreed to loan us up to $400,000 under an unsecured promissory
note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
December 31, 2018, $283,754 was outstanding under such promissory note.
Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we borrowed an additional $75,000 under such
promissory note. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at
the earlier of June 30, 2019 and the closing of this offering. These loans will
be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the offering proceeds that has
been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting
commissions) not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as
may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In
the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a
portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay
such loaned amounts. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans made to us by our sponsor,
an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors may be convertible
into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender at the
time of the business combination. Such units would be identical to the units
sold in this offering except that the warrants underlying such units would be
identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of
such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and
directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with
respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than
our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors, if any,
as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and
provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust
account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their respective affiliates may also purchase shares in privately
negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the
completion of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any
such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions,
they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination (so
that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the
agreement for our initial business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business
combination and then, only in connection with those public shares that such
stockholder has properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
in this prospectus; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial
business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (3) the
redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter
agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to (1) waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held
by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination
and (2) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and
public shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an
amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify
the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our
public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem
100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity. In addition, our initial stockholders, officers
and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers or directors acquires
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

million (or $81.2 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional ADSs in full), based on the initial public offering price of $12.00
per ADS, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

As of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million. We
currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $25.0 million to fund the continued clinical development of
  elamipretide for the treatment of primary mitochondrial myopathy through
  pivotal data from a Phase 3 clinical trial;

. approximately $8.0 million to fund the continued clinical development of
  elamipretide for the treatment of Barth and LHON through anticipated upcoming
  regulatory interactions;

. approximately $8.0 million to fund the continued clinical development of
  elamipretide for the treatment of dry AMD through initiation of a Phase 2b
  clinical trial;                                                            

. approximately $6.0 million to fund the continued preclinical development of
  SBT-272 through IND-enabling studies and to fund a Phase 1 safety trial;

. approximately $10.4 million for principal and interest payments that we are
  obligated to make over the next 12 months under our term loan facility with
  Hercules; and

. the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
  including advancement of our pipeline of discovery compounds.

As of September 30, 2018, we had $20.0 million of outstanding principal under
our term loan facility with Hercules and an additional $20.0 million of
available borrowings, subject to achievement of specified milestones. Borrowings
under the term loan facility bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to
the greater of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus 5.50% or (ii) 9.50%.
Beginning in December 2018, we are required to repay principal and interest on
these borrowings in monthly installments through the scheduled maturity of
January 1, 2021.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development of product candidates, the status of
and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may
enter into with third parties, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering.

We anticipate that, assuming our current operating plan, the net proceeds from
this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will only
be sufficient to allow us to complete a Phase 3 clinical trial for elamiptretide
for primary mitochondrial myopathy, to initiate but not complete our planned
Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of dry AMD, and to conduct a Phase 1
trial of SBT-272. Based on our current operating plan, we will require
additional capital to advance elamipretide through pivotal trials for
indications other than primary mitochondrial myopathy and to advance our other
product candidates through later-stage clinical development, as well as to
commercialize any of our product candidates if we receive regulatory approval.
We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong,
including assumptions regarding the clinical trials necessary for FDA approval
of our product candidates, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we
currently expect. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with
product development, including risks and uncertainties with respect to
successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials, at this time we cannot
reasonably estimate the amount of additional funding that will be necessary to
complete the clinical development of any of our product candidates. If we
receive regulatory approval for elamipretide, SBT-20 or any of our other product
candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to
product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution. Accordingly, we will
be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity
offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other
sources.

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be 
approximately $6.7 million, based on an initial public offering price of $5.60

determine to undertake such study. The balance of the net proceeds is expected
to be used for other general working capital purposes.

A significant portion of the net proceeds will be utilized to finance the costs
for leasing and developing the premises for each medical clinic, purchasing
medical and office equipment, purchasing medical supplies and inventory,
spending on advertising and marketing, as well as recruiting and hiring staff,
and other expenses. We estimate that it will take at least $700,000 to open each
new clinic, with an additional $300,000 of operating capital and $200,000 credit
line needed to purchase equipment and fund operating losses during the first six
months of operation. These start-up costs may increase if there are any delays,
problems or other events not currently anticipated. Although we expect each
medical clinic to become profitable approximately six months after opening based
on our experience with opening the Ozzie Smith Centers in Chesterfield, Missouri
in May 2016 and in St. Peters, Missouri in August 2017, and with the IMAC
Regeneration Center in Murray, Kentucky in February 2017, no assurances can be
given that any of the clinics or our company overall will operate profitably.
For example, the David Price Center in Brentwood, Tennessee, which opened in May
2017, initially experienced unforeseen delays in staffing, construction and
marketing. We also plan to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to
finance acquisitions of, or investments in, competitive and complementary
businesses as a part of our growth strategy. We currently have no commitments in
place with respect to any such acquisitions or investments.

A portion of the net proceeds will also be used to fund the purchase of
equipment and other research-related materials for the development and testing
of BioFirma’s NeoCyte product, as well as the costs associated with hiring
additional personnel, engaging with the FDA and obtaining requisite FDA
regulatory certifications for the NeoCyte product. We believe that NeoCyte has
the potential to be an important part of our overall service and treatment
offerings in the future. We recognize the benefits of developing the NeoCyte
product and quantifying scientific advancements with primary data collected
within our IMAC medical clinics.

Funds for working capital and general corporate purposes include amounts
required to pay officers’ salaries, consulting fees, professional fees, ongoing
public reporting costs, computer equipment costs, data streaming transmission
costs, office-related expenses and other corporate expenses.

We believe that, with the net proceeds of this offering, our current cash and
our available lines of credit, we will have sufficient cash reserves available
to cover expenses for at least 12 months following the closing of this offering.
Given the volatility in U.S. equity markets and our normal working capital
fluctuations, and depending on the actual level of net proceeds raised in this
offering, we may seek to raise additional capital following this offering to
supplement our operating cash flows to the extent we can do so on competitive
market terms. In such event, an equity financing may dilute the ownership
interests of our stockholders and investors in this offering. In all events,
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available to us
when desired or needed and, if available, on terms acceptable to us.

• approximately $40.0 million to fund research and development of our other
  development programs; and                                         

• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds and our existing cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities to in-license, acquire, or invest in
complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets. However, we have no
current commitments or obligations to do so.

We believe, based on our current operating plan, that the net proceeds from this
offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will
be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months, although
there can be no assurance in that regard. In particular, we expect that the net
proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities will allow us to complete our ongoing Phase 2b clinical
trial for GB001, our planned Phase 1b clinical trial in PAH for GB002 and our
planned Phase 1b clinical trial in UC for GB004. However, our expected use of
proceeds from this offering described above represents our current intentions
based on our present plans and business condition. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the actual
amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above. The net proceeds from
this offering, together with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, will not be sufficient for us to fund all of our product candidates
through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to
complete the development and commercialization of all of our product candidates.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the time and cost necessary to conduct our planned clinical
trials and preclinical studies and the results of such trials and studies and
other factors, as well as the amount of cash used in our operations and any
unforeseen cash needs. Therefore, our actual expenditures may differ materially
from the estimates described above. We may find it necessary or advisable to use
the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds.

Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."

million, or $76.5 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares of common stock from us in full, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $67.0 million to fund the clinical development of HPN424 (our
  PSMA-targeting TriTAC) through our Phase 1 trial and into a Phase 2 trial and
  HPN536 (our MSLN-targeting TriTAC) through our planned Phase 1/2a trial; and
                                                                 
• the remaining proceeds to fund the development of our pipeline, including  
  HPN217 (our BCMA-targeting TriTAC), our DLL3-Targeting TriTAC, our ProTriTAC
  programs and our discovery programs, and for other general corporate purposes,
  which may include the hiring of additional personnel, capital expenditures and
  the costs of operating as a public company.       

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and prevailing business conditions,
which could change in the future as such plans and conditions evolve. Predicting
the cost necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult, and the
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending
on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the status of
and results from preclinical studies and clinical trials, any collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties and any unforeseen cash needs. As a
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our current business plans, we believe that the net proceeds from this
offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be
sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least 12 months from the date
of this prospectus. The expected net proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient for us to fund any of our product candidates through regulatory
approval, and we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete
the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we plan to invest the
net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing investment-grade securities,
certificates of deposit or government securities. In addition, in the event that
Maverick’s request for an injunction to prohibit us from further developing our
ProTriTAC platform is granted, we will not be allocating any of the proceeds
from this offering to further develop ProTriTAC until the injunction is lifted,
if ever."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table,
    any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In
    the event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this
    table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $7,000,000 which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.
    In the event the over-allotment option is exercised, we anticipate that the
    additional net proceeds held outside the trust account will be allocated to
    fund working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $200,000,000 (or $230,000,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $7,000,000 (or $8,050,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas with American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act that invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $5.06 million per
year, assuming an interest rate of 2.53% per year; however, we can provide no
assurance regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise
and income tax obligations, as well as expenses relating to the administration
of the trust account, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the
private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or
their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with
applicable law and the rules of the NYSE. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

The Anchor Investors have expressed to us an interest to purchase an aggregate
of 2,530,000 units in this offering and we have agreed to direct the
underwriters to sell to the Anchor Investors such number of units. If the Anchor
Investors do not purchase an aggregate of 2,530,000 units in this offering, then
we will redeem from the Anchor Investors their founder shares for the original
purchase price and they will not acquire any private placement warrants. In
such circumstance, we expect to effect a stock dividend or other appropriate
mechanism with respect to our founder shares such that our sponsor will own 20%
of our outstanding common stock following this offering. In addition, our
sponsor will instead purchase from us an aggregate of 4,000,000 private
placement warrants (or 4,600,000 warrants if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full) in the private placement that will close simultaneously with
the closing of this offering.

Each of the Anchor Investors has agreed with us that if, at the time of any
stockholder vote with respect to an initial business combination or the business
day immediately prior to the consummation of our initial business combination,
such Anchor Investor does not own a number of public shares equal to the number
of shares purchased by it in this offering, then (assuming that the Anchor
Investors collectively have purchased 2,530,000 units in this offering and have
not had their founder shares redeemed by us) such Anchor Investor will forfeit
to us all of the founder shares that it purchased prior to this offering. There
can be no assurance that the Anchor Investors will acquire any units in this
offering or what amount of equity the Anchor Investors will retain, if any, upon
the consummation of our initial business combination. As a result of the founder
shares and private placement warrants that the Anchor Investors may hold, they
may have different interests with respect to a vote on an initial business
combination than other public stockholders.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described in this prospectus, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly
submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, and
(iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
business combination within 24 months following the closing of this offering,
subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations
(including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the
proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

In addition to the Anchor Investors’ commitment to retain a certain amount of
equity as described above, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into
a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held
by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
In addition, our sponsor, officer and directors have agreed to waive their
rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any
founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors, Advisory Board members or affiliates acquires public shares
in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame."

offering will be approximately $159.8 million, or approximately $184.4 million
if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,
based upon the initial public offering price of $19.00 per share and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We currently
anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing resources, as follows:

• approximately $50.0 million to fund Phase 1 trials for AL001 and AL002, as
  well as preparation for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for AL001;

• approximately $25.0 million to advance AL003 and AL101 in and through Phase 1
  clinical trials;
 
• approximately $40.0 million to fund Phase 2 enabling activities for AL002 and
  AL003;

• approximately $25.0 million to continue to advance our preclinical development
  pipeline into Phase 1 clinical trials;

• approximately $15.0 million to further develop our Discovery Platform; and

• the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate activities.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through license or acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary
businesses, products or technologies. While we currently have no agreements or
commitments to complete any such transaction at this time, we may use a portion
of the net proceeds for these purposes.

The net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash, cash equivalents,
and marketable securities, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our
product candidates through regulatory approval, our preclinical development
pipeline through Phase 1 clinical trials, or any product candidates resulting
from our Discovery Platform into preclinical studies and clinical trials. We
will also need to raise additional capital to complete the development and
commercialization of our products.

Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors including the results of our research and development efforts,
the timing and success of preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or
clinical trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory
submissions, the amount of cash obtained through our existing collaborations and
future collaborations, if any, and any unforeseen cash needs.

Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with the successful completion of our initial business
    combination.
 
(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the 
    proceeds of a loan from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this 
    prospectus. As of December 31, 2018, $150,000 was outstanding under this 
    loan arrangement. This loan will be repaid upon completion of this offering
    out of the $700,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the 
    payment of offering expenses other than underwriting discounts, or will be 
    cancelled in exchange for a portion of the purchase price payable by our 
    sponsor for its private units.
 
(3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth in this prospectus. 
    For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our 
    current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
    account.

Nasdaq rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering
and the sale of the private units be deposited in a trust account. Of the gross
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, a total of 
$151,500,000 (or $174,225,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), will be placed in a trust account in the United States in
New York, New York, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills,
notes and bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and
which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may
be released to us to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the trust account will
be released from the trust account until the earlier of: (1) the completion of
our initial business combination within the required time period; (2) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed an
initial business combination in the required time period; and (3) our redemption
of our public shares in connection with the approval of any amendment to the
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our
pre-initial business combination activity and related stockholders’ rights,
including the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the
required time period.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply
the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired
businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in
consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other
companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our sponsor or an affiliate of
our sponsor or our officers and directors, but such members of our management
team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq, we have
agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for
office space and general and administrative services. Upon completion of our
initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into additional units of the post-business
combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender.
The units would be identical to the private units. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be
further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination.
If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of common stock that
such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate our initial business combination within 21 months (or 24 months, as
applicable) from the closing of this offering, or, if our charter documents are
amended to so provide, (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection
with a stockholder vote to amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A)
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 21 months
(or 24 months, as applicable) from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business
combination activity, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will
a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our founders, directors, director nominees and executive officers have entered
into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to (1) waive
their redemption rights with respect to any common stock held by them in
connection with the completion of our initial business combination or any
amendment to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation relating to our pre-initial business combination activity and
related stockholders’ rights and (2) waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares and
private shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 21
months (or 24 months, as applicable) from the closing of this offering. However,
if our founders, executive officers, directors, or director nominees acquire
public shares after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    borrowed from our Keen Nice Communications Limited, which is owned by Jining
    Li, our director, described below. These funds will be repaid out of the 
    proceeds of this offering available to us. If we determine not to proceed 
    with the offering, such amounts would not be repaid.                  

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.                                                       

(3) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to Chardan Capital 
    Markets, LLC in an amount of up to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised
    in the offering described below.                   

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $475,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.                                 

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not 
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.  

Our sponsor has agreed to purchase an aggregate of 247,500 private units at a
price of $10.00 per private unit ($2,475,000 in the aggregate) in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our
sponsor has further agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the
underwriters, it will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per private unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 22,500 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least
$10.00 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless
of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These
additional private units will be purchased in a private placement that will
occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of
the over-allotment option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account described below.

$50,000,000, or $57,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at Morgan Stanley in the United States, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Pursuant to the investment management trust agreement that will govern the
investment of such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will
direct Morgan Stanley to invest the funds as set forth in such written
instructions and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise
instructed in accordance with the investment management trust agreement. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or
other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination to the extent not used to pay converting shareholders. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Oriental Holdings Limited, a company owned by our director,
Jining Li, through Keen Nice Communications Limited, and Yongsheng Liu, of a
monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support, of which HKD$50,000 (or
approximately USD$6,379 based on an exchange rate of HKD$7.84 to USD$1.00 on
January 9, 2019) per month will be paid to Yongsheng Liu, our Chief Executive
Officer, for his services to us. However, pursuant to the terms of such
agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by our
audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay
actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business
combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and
payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business
combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by Oriental Holdings Limited
for our benefit. We believe that the fee charged by Oriental Holdings Limited is
at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.
This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public shareholders.
Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$475,000. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto. If the
payment of our liabilities, including the deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC in an amount up to 3.5% of
the total gross proceeds raised in the offering, were to reduce the amount
available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or
sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we
would not be able to consummate such transaction. To the extent that our share
capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to
consummate a business combination, to pay holders who wish to convert their
shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses
relating thereto will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with
any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Oriental Holdings Limited,
which is owned by our director, Jining Li, through Keen Nice Communications
Limited, and Yongsheng Liu, has agreed to advance us the funds necessary to
complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than $18,500) and
has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of September 30, 2018, Keen Nice Communications Limited, which is owned by
Jining Li, our director, had loaned to us an aggregate of $178,205 to be used to
pay formation and a portion of the expenses of this offering. The loan is
payable without interest on the date on which we consummate our initial public
offering. If we determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would
not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into private units at a price of
$10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued
units to acquire 55,000 ordinary shares (which includes 5,000 shares issuable
upon conversion of rights) and warrants to purchase 25,000 ordinary shares if
$500,000 of notes were so converted). If we do not complete our initial business
combination, the loans would be repaid out of funds not held in the trust
account, and only to the extent available. These notes would be in addition to
any notes we issued in exchange for the funds necessary to extend our life. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination
within the required time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such
public shares or sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection
with a business combination which we consummate or in connection with an
amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
prior to the consummation of an initial business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."
"INMUNE BIO, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/inmune-bio-inc-1027987-87779,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/inmune-bio-inc-1027987-87779,424B3,12/21/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13121168,"After deducting the commissions payable to the Placement Agent and the estimated
offering expenses that are payable by us, we estimate that the net proceeds from
the sale of the common stock offered pursuant to this prospectus will be
approximately $6,898,571 if only the Minimum Offering Amount is sold and
$18,058,571 if the Maximum Offering Amount is sold.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund our
research and drug development activities. If we raise the Maximum Offering
Amount, we expect to complete a Phase I/II trial with INKmune in Ovarian Cancer,
a Phase I/II trial with INKmune in high risk MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndromes – a
precursor to AML), a Phase 1 trial with INB03 in patients with advanced cancer
and elevated MDSC in their blood and after the Phase 1 INB03 trial a Phase II
trial with INB03 combined with an approved checkpoint inhibitor for patients
that have failed first line therapy and have increased MDSC in their blood. We
intend to use:

. approximately $4,000,000 for our Phase I/II clinical trial for our INKmune
  product candidate for Ovarian Cancer;

. approximately $1,500,000 for our Phase I clinical trial with INB03 in
  patients with advanced cancer and elevated MDSC in their blood;

. approximately $2,500,000 for our Phase II clinical trials for INB03 combined
  with an approved checkpoint inhibitor for treatment for patients with cancer
  who have failed first line therapy and have increased MDSC in their blood; and

. approximately $4,000,000 for our Phase I/II clinical trial for our INKmune
  product candidate for high risk MDS;

. approximately $3,000,000 for manufacturing a new batch of INB03 to support the
  Phase II trials and further clinical development; and

. the remaining $3,058,571 for research and development activities, working 
  capital and general corporate purposes. Research and development activities
  include improvements to our two platform therapies INB03 and INKmune, further
  optimized manufacturing of INB03 and INKmune and pre-clinical testing for
  additional diseases.

If just the minimum is raised, we will conduct only two clinical trials, the
Ovarian Cancer Phase I/II and MDSC INB03 Phase I trials and depend on existing
drug supplies to support those clinical trials. The Ovarian Cancer Phase I/II
trial for the minimum and maximum offering are identical planned programs.

. approximately $4,000,000 for our Phase I/II clinical trial for our INKmune
  product candidate for Ovarian Cancer;

. approximately $1,500,000 for our Phase I clinical trial with INB03 in patients
  with advanced cancer and elevated MDSC in their blood;

. the remaining $1,398,571 for working capital and general corporate purposes.

The Company anticipates that the existing cash on hand plus the expected R&D
cash credits from the UK and Australian trials and net proceeds from the Minimum
Offering Amount will be enough to complete the INKmune Phase I/II trial in women
with ovarian cancer and the Phase I trial using INB03 in ovarian cancer
patients.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and our
existing cash to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary businesses,
technologies, products or assets. However, we have no current plans, commitments
or obligations to do so. Other than as set forth, we do not anticipate requiring
any material amounts of other funds to accomplish the specified purposes.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering (whether from the Minimum
Offering Amount or the Maximum Offering Amount) and our existing cash will be
sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months. This
expected use of the net proceeds from the offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. We cannot specify with
certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive
from this offering, or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set
forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on
numerous factors, including the ongoing status of and results from clinical
trials and other studies, the product approval process with the FDA, and the
scope of our commercialization efforts, as well as any strategic collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, any
unforeseen cash needs, and our investments and acquisitions. We may find it
necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will
have broad discretion in using these proceeds. Investors will be relying on our
judgment regarding the use of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the
use of proceeds as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds that we
receive in short-term and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade investments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government. We cannot predict whether the invested
proceeds will yield a favorable return.

Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from
time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We cannot
guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the
United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements
to conform these statements to actual results."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their    
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
    combination.                                                                 

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans   
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. On each  
    of October 18, 2018 and January 25, 2019, we borrowed $150,000 under the
    promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of 
    this offering. The $300,000 will be repaid upon completion of this offering  
    out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the   
    payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and       
    amounts not to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering      
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the
    offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such
    excess with funds not held in the trust account.                                    

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial       
    business combination, $13,125,000, which constitutes the underwriters’       
    deferred commissions (or $15,093,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment     
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds 
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
                                      
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.
               
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
    financing.                                                                   

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $375,000,000 (or $431,250,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $13,125,000 (or
$15,093,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $5,625,000 per year,
assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year. Except with respect to interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to fund
our Regulatory Withdrawals and/or to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within
24 months from the closing of this offering or (ii) with respect to any other
provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination
activity and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law. Based on assumed interest rates, we expect
that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes, will be
sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are 
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. On each of
October 18, 2018 and January 25, 2019, we borrowed $150,000 under the promissory
note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of
September 30, 2019 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon
the closing of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held
in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange
Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would
constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange
Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the
Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such
purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net 
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (b) with
respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months following
the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements)
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us,
pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect
to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial
stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to
complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if
our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $2.3 billion, based upon the
initial public offering price of $72.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of our Class A
common stock from us is exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to
us would be approximately $2.6 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock and
enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to
satisfy our anticipated tax withholding and remittance obligations of
$448.4 million related to the RSU Settlement. This amount is based upon the
initial public offering price of $72.00 per share.

We also intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for general
corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital
expenditures. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds we receive
from this offering to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services or
technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any material
acquisitions or investments at this time. We cannot specify with certainty the
particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering.
Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds. Pending the
use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we may invest the net
proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term, investment grade,
interest-bearing instruments."

of approximately US$20.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, and net proceeds
from the maximum offering amount of approximately US$35.5 million after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated expenses
payable by us. These estimates are based upon an assumed initial public offering
price of US$6.0 per ADS, the initial public offering price shown on the front
cover of this prospectus. A US$1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial
public offering price of US$6.0 per ADS, would increase (decrease) the net
proceeds to us from this offering by US$3.7 million if the minimum offering
amount is sold, or approximately US$6.2 million if the maximum offering amount
is sold, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• 20% of the net proceeds of this offering to expand our branch network,
  including expanding branches in tier one and tier two cities in China,
  developing our base of independent investment advisors and additional seed
  clients, and hiring additional investment advisors;

• 20% of the net proceeds of this offering to upgrade our IT infrastructure;

• 20% of the net proceeds of this offering to launch additional FoFs and
  non-performing loan funds under our asset management business; and

• the remaining 40% for general corporate purposes, including to fund strategic
  investments and acquisitions.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

In using the net proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our WFOE only
through loans or capital contributions and to our VIE only through loans,
subject to the satisfaction of applicable government registration, approval and
filing requirements. We expect 30% of the net proceeds to be used by us or our
offshore intermediate holding companies for general corporate purposes, and the
remaining 70% to be immediately remitted to our WFOE and/or our VIE following
the completion of this offering to be applied towards our planned use of
proceeds. With respect to capital contributions that we can make to our WFOE, as
of the date of this prospectus, the maximum amount of capital contributions that
we may make to our WFOE is US$200 million, without obtaining approvals from SAFE
or other government authorities. The WFOE may increase its registered capital to
receive additional capital contributions from us at any time, and currently
there is no statutory limit to the amount of registered capital. The relevant
filing and registration processes for increasing the cap for capital
contributions typically take approximately eight weeks to be completed. With
respect to loans, pursuant to relevant PRC regulations, the maximum amount of
loans that we may provide to our WFOE equals to the larger amount of (i) the
balance between the total investment amount (approved by the Ministry of
Commerce or its local counterpart) and the amount of registered capital of our
WFOE, or (ii) two times of the amount of the net assets of the WFOE calculated
in accordance with PBOC Circular 9; and the maximum amount of loans we may
provide to our VIE equals to two times of the amount of the net assets of our
VIE calculated in accordance with PBOC Circular 9.Each of the loans to our WFOE
or VIE is subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration or
approval requirements. The relevant filing and registration processes for such
loans typically take approximately four weeks to be completed. While we
currently see no material obstacles to complete the relevant filing and
registration processes with respect to future loans or capital contributions to
our WFOE and/or our VIE, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

our common stock in this offering will be approximately $113.3 million, based on
the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from us is
exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately
$130.9 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $7.0 to $9.0 million to initiate and complete a Phase 1/2a      
  clinical trial for our CD19 CAR T cell product candidate;                     

• approximately $50.0 to $52.0 million to advance and expand the development of 
  our other CAR T cell product candidates and allogeneic CAR T immunotherapy    
  platform, including to submit an IND for each of our CD20, BCMA and CLL-1     
  CAR T cell product candidates;                                                

• approximately $18.0 to $20.0 million to advance and expand the preclinical    
  development of our in vivo gene correction platform, including early discovery
  efforts, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, and IND-enabling      
  studies;                                                                      

• approximately $12.0 to $14.0 million to fund the build-out of our planned     
  cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility; and                                    

• the remainder to fund new and ongoing research and development activities, to 
  fund the portion of expenses we are responsible for with respect to the       
  development of our food platform and for working capital and other general    
  corporate purposes.                                                           

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in additional
businesses, technologies, products or assets, although currently we have no
specific agreements, commitments or understandings in this regard. As of the
date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or
the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Predicting
the cost necessary to develop our technology and product candidates can be
difficult, and we anticipate that we will need additional funds to complete our
development programs. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the
extent of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development
efforts may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical
studies and any clinical trials we may commence in the future, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Based on our current operating plan and planned use of the net proceeds from
this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such
funds will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements through 2020. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available
capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may satisfy our future
cash needs through the sale of equity securities, debt financings, working
capital lines of credit, corporate collaborations or license agreements, grant
funding, interest income earned on invested cash balances or a combination of
one or more of these sources.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we        
    borrowed from our sponsor, described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering available to us. If we determine not to proceed
    with the offering, such amounts would not be repaid.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our    
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including  
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to Chardan Capital   
    Markets, LLC in an amount of up to 3.0% of the total gross proceeds raised in
    the offering described below.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $500,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.  

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

8i Pte and its designees have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 221,250 private
units at a price of $10.00 per private unit ($2,212,500 in the aggregate) in a
private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this
offering. 8i Pte and its designees have further agreed that if the
over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters, they will purchase from
us at a price of $10.00 per private unit an additional number of private units
(up to a maximum of 18,750 private units) pro rata with the amount of the
over-allotment option exercised so that at least $10.00 per share sold to the
public in this offering is held in trust regardless of whether the
over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These additional private
units will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously
with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment
option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in
the trust account described below. 

$50,000,000, or $57,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at JPMorgan Chase Bank in the United States, maintained by
Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee. Pursuant to the investment management
trust agreement that will govern the investment of such funds, the trustee, upon
our written instructions, will direct JPMorgan Chase Bank to invest the funds as
set forth in such written instructions and to custody the funds while invested
and until otherwise instructed in accordance with the investment management
trust agreement. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
government treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less,
or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in
United States government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to
us to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business
combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be
used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
complete a business combination to the extent not used to pay converting
shareholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business. 

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or
any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us outside of the trust account for our
working capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be
approximately $500,000. We intend to use the excess working capital available
for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with
our search for a target business and for director and officer liability
insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us. 

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto. If the
payment of our liabilities, including the deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC in an amount up to 3.0% of
the total gross proceeds raised in the offering, were to reduce the amount
available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or
sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we
would not be able to consummate such transaction. To the extent that our share
capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to
consummate a business combination, to pay holders who wish to convert their
shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses
relating thereto will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with
any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, James Tan, our Chief
Executive Officer, has agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such
liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than $18,500) and has agreed
not to seek repayment of such expenses. 

8i Pte, a company wholly owned by Mr. James Tan, extended a loan of $25,000 to
us on May 3, 2018. This loan is non-interest bearing and due on demand. For the
period from November 24, 2017 through July 31, 2018, 8i Pte had advanced an
aggregate of $137,598 to us in regard to the costs associated with formation and
the Proposed Offering. Such advances are non-interest bearing. On August 8,
2018, we repaid $25,000 to 8i Pte. We intend to repay 8i Pte from the proceeds
of the Proposed Offering not being placed in the trust account. 

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the relevant insider’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be
converted upon consummation of our business combination into private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being
issued units to acquire 55,000 ordinary shares (which includes 5,000 shares
issuable upon conversion of rights) and warrants to purchase 25,000 ordinary
shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted). If we do not complete our
initial business combination, the loans would be repaid out of funds not held in
the trust account, and only to the extent available. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination
within the required time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such
public shares or sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection
with a business combination which we consummate or in connection with an
amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
prior to the consummation of an initial business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."
GENFIT S.A.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/genfit-sa-1078787-89050,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/genfit-sa-1078787-89050,424B4,3/27/2019,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13323689,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the global offering of
approximately €108.4 million ($122.4 million), based on an initial public
offering price of $20.32 per ADS in the ADS offering, corresponding to €18.00
per ordinary share in the European private placement, after deducting
underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and
assuming no exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 997,500 additional
ADSs and/or ordinary shares. If the underwriters exercise in full their option
to purchase additional ADSs and/or ordinary shares in the global offering, we
estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the global offering of
approximately €125.1 million ($141.3 million), after deducting underwriting
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from the global offering as follows:

• approximately €13.3 million ($15.0 million) to prepare for the potential
  commercialization of elafibranor in NASH by building out our commercial
  infrastructure;

• approximately €44.3 million ($50.0 million) to complete our ongoing Phase 3
  clinical development of elafibranor for the treatment of NASH through to, at
  least, the submission of an NDA to the FDA and EMA and the launch of the Phase
  4 clinical trial;

• approximately €31.0 million ($35.0 million) to conduct and complete our 
  planned global Phase 3 clinical trial of elafibranor for the treatment of PBC;

• approximately €5.3 million ($6.0 million) to advance the commercial 
  development of our IVD test to identify NASH patients through the launch of
  the LDT and completion of the work required to obtain regulatory approval for
  our IVD kit;

• approximately €5.3 million ($6.0 million) to advance our research program on
  the use of elafibranor as a potential backbone for combination therapies in
  order to launch two proof-of-concept studies; and

• the remainder for working capital and for general corporate purposes.

Even with the expected net proceeds from the global offering, and depending on
our ability to generate sufficient revenues from the future potential
commercialization of our drug candidates and IVD test, we may need to raise
additional capital in the future to develop and commercialize our drug
candidates and IVD test, including future clinical trials that may be required
by regulatory authorities. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may
prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner
than we currently expect.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the global offering
or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical 
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical
studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in
the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our drug candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
future financing needs remain uncertain and our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from the global offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from the global offering, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments,
including short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

approximately $120.5 million (or approximately $209.0 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class A
common stock from us in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive
any proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock by the selling stockholders.
We have agreed to pay certain expenses in connection with this offering on
behalf of the selling stockholders, including all underwriting discounts and
commissions applicable to the sale of shares of Class A common stock by the
selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility and create a public market for our Class A common stock. We
currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for
general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and

(1) As of the date of this prospectus, $194,493 of these expenses have been paid
    from the proceeds of loans and advances made to us by an affiliate of
    Insurance Acquisition Sponsor, LLC. Loans by an affiliate of Insurance
    Acquisition Sponsor, LLC will be repaid upon the earlier of the completion
    of this offering or June 30, 2019. If offering expenses actually paid are
    less than the estimates set forth in this table, the balance will be used
    for post-closing working capital.

(2) The representative has agreed to defer until consummation of our initial
    business combination approximately $5.2 million of their underwriting
    commissions (or approximately $6.4 million if the underwriters’
    overallotment option is exercised in full), which equals 4.0% of the gross
    proceeds from the units sold to the public, excluding any units purchased
    pursuant to the underwriters’ overallotment option, and 6.0% of the gross
    proceeds from the units sold to the public pursuant to the underwriters’
    overallotment option. Upon consummation of our initial business combination,
    the deferred commissions will be paid to the representative from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital.

(3) $131.0 million from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement
    ($150.65 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in
    full), including deferred underwriting commissions of approximately $5.2
    million (approximately $6.4 million if the underwriters exercise their
    overallotment option in full), will be placed in a trust account held at
    JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., located in the United States, with Continental
    Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    If we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to
    industry specific regulation, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary, and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

A total of $131.0 million (or $150.65 million if the underwriters’ overallotment
option is exercised in full) of the aggregate net proceeds from this offering
and the private placement, including approximately $5.2 million (or
approximately $6.4 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option in full) of the deferred underwriting discount, will be placed in a trust
account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and
will be invested only in United States government treasury bills with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in United States
Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act. Except for interest income released to us for the payment of taxes
or dissolution expenses, none of the funds held in the trust account will be
released, subject to the requirements of law, until the earlier of (i) the
consummation of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of our
public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 18
months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ overallotment option), subject to applicable law; (iii) the
redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months
from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our liquidation or
if our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases to
pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of the
18 month period (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust
account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment,
that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify an attractive
business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal
requirements to consummate a business combination). Based on current interest
rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $1,965,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year.

The net proceeds held in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting
commissions) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. If we pay for
our initial business combination using stock or debt securities, or if we do not
use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase
price in connection with our business combination, we may use the remaining cash
released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for
maintenance or expansion of the operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement
held out of trust will be sufficient to pay our costs and expenses prior to our
initial business combination. This belief is based on the fact that while we may
begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an
indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending
on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that
addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us.

An affiliate of Insurance Acquisition Sponsor, LLC has committed to loan us up
to an aggregate of $500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this
offering (of which no amounts have been loaned as of the date of this
prospectus). These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the
earlier of June 30, 2019 or the completion of this offering. In addition, in
order to fund transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
combination, our sponsor or one of its affiliates has committed to loan us funds
as may be required up to a maximum of $750,000, which will be repaid only upon
the consummation of an initial business combination. Should these amounts be
insufficient, our sponsor or one of its affiliates may fund our additional
working capital requirements or finance transaction costs, as necessary.
However, they are under no obligation to do so. If we complete our initial
business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of
the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out
of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the placement
warrants issued to our sponsor as part of the private placement units.

We will reimburse our sponsor or its affiliate for office space, utilities,
secretarial support and administrative services provided to members of our
management team, in an amount equal to $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our
initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their respective
affiliates may purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial
business combination, although as of the date of this prospectus (apart from the
purchase of the placement units) they have no commitments, plans or intentions
to engage in such transactions. If they do effect such purchases, we anticipate
that they would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities
that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption of their
shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in direct
negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions. All holders approached
in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There is no
limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our sponsor, directors,
officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when
they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to
the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange
Act or in transactions that would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under
the Exchange Act. Although they do not currently anticipate paying any premium
purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the price they may
pay. They may also enter into transactions to provide such holders with
incentives to acquire shares or vote their shares in favor of an initial
business combination. No funds in the trust account may be used to effect
purchases of shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination. Moreover, the redemption threshold may be further limited
by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If the amount
of redemptions plus any cash required by our initial business combination would
cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,000, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 18 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option),
subject to applicable law; (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 18 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any
exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our
liquidation or in the event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the
trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination
prior to the expiration of the 18 month period (our board of directors may
determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it
determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining
time that we will be able to identify an attractive acquisition target or
satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a
business combination). In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

The initial holders, our officers and directors and Cantor Fitzgerald have
agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and
placement shares, as applicable, (i) in connection with the consummation of a
business combination, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the completion
of this offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment
option) and (iii) if we fail to consummate a business combination within 18
months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ overallotment option) or if we liquidate prior to the expiration
of the 18 month period. The initial holders and our directors and officers have
also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to public shares in
connection with the consummation of a business combination and in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100%
of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within the 18 month period. However, the initial holders and our directors and
officers will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any public shares
held by them if we fail to consummate a business combination or liquidate within
the 18 month period. Cantor Fitzgerald will have the same redemption rights as a
public stockholder with respect to any public shares it acquires."

Placement of approximately US$100.5 million, or approximately US$115.0 million
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all of our shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement, as
follows:

. approximately 40% for general corporate purposes, which may include investment
  in product and technology research and development, sales and marketing
  activities, technology infrastructure, capital expenditures, and other
  general and administrative matters;

. approximately 15% to set up entities and apply for operating licenses in
  multiple jurisdictions to expand our customer base and better serve them with
  global investment products;

. approximately 15% to satisfy the increased capital adequacy requirements
  pursuant to the New Zealand Stock Exchange or regulators in other
  jurisdictions; and

. approximately 30% for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies,
  solutions or businesses that complement our business, although we have no
  present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or
  investments.

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our
business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in
applying the net proceeds of the offering and the Concurrent Private Placement.
If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the
proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement differently than
as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement,
we are permitted under the PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our
PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to
satisfaction of the applicable government registration and approval
requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiary or make
additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to fund its capital
expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
obtain these government registrations or approvals in a timely manner, if at
all.

Pending the use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in
demand deposits or make investments including cash equivalents such as
interest-bearing government securities."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    December 31, 2018, we had borrowed $299,000 under the promissory note with 
    our sponsor. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the proceeds that have been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in
    the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as 
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.

(2) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial 
    business combination, $9,135,000 (or $10,505,250 if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full), which constitutes the 
    underwriters’ deferred commissions will be paid to the underwriters from the
    funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts 
    released by the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders, will be released to 
    us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the 
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest 
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(3) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement 
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and 
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.

(4) Represents the first year of payments to our President and to our Chief
    Financial Officer, respectively.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $261,000,000 (or $300,150,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $9,135,000 (or up to $10,505,250 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $3,654,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 1.4% per year; however, we can provide no assurance
regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, the
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will
not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the
completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public
shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $35,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. As of December 31, 2018, we had borrowed $299,000
under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and
are due at the earlier of June 30, 2019 or the closing of this offering. The
loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of offering proceeds
not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed 
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination, 
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    December 31, 2018, we borrowed $262,880 under the promissory note with our
    sponsor. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of
    the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of
    offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the
    trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the

    deferred commissions (or up to $10,062,500 if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed
    estimates.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. The payment for office space, utilities, administrative and support
    services in the table above assumes the consummation of our initial business
    combination takes the maximum 24 months. Based on current interest rates, we
    would expect the trust account to generate approximately $3,750,000 of
    interest annually following the investment of such funds in specified U.S.
    Government Treasury bills or in specified money market funds; however, we
    can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an
    interest rate of 1.5% per annum based upon current yields of securities in
    which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance
    transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
    combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may
    be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the
    trust account. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into
    warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The
    warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our
    sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no
    written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to
    seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
    sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
    funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to
    funds in our trust account.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

Nasdaq listing rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $250,000,000 (or $287,500,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $8,750,000 (or up to
$10,062,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering,
be placed in a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee. The funds in the trust account will be invested only
in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $3,750,000 per year,
assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw
any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the
withdrawal of interest to pay our franchise and income taxes, and the funds held
in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination; (2) the
redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(a) to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24
months from the closing of this offering or (b) with respect to any other
provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination
activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we
expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay 
taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply
the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of
post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination, including pursuant to the forward purchase
agreement.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to loan funds
to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month, for up to 24
months, for office space, utilities, administrative and support services. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. As of December 31, 2018, we borrowed $262,880 under
the promissory note with our sponsor. These loans are non-interest bearing,
unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30, 2019 or the closing of this
offering. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the
$750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of
offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be
convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the
lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued
to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no
written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek
loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we
do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

We have entered into a forward purchase agreement pursuant to which Crescent, in
its capacity as investment advisor on behalf of one or more Crescent Funds, has
committed on behalf of the Crescent Funds, to purchase, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in such agreement, including obtaining fund-level approvals
by the relevant investment committee and/or other governing body of such funds,
an aggregate of 5,000,000 forward purchase units, consisting of forward purchase
shares and the forward purchase warrants, for $10.00 per unit, or an aggregate
amount of $50,000,000, in a private placement that will close simultaneously
with the closing of our initial business combination. The sale of these forward
purchase units will, if the relevant conditions are satisfied, result in gross
proceeds to us necessary to enable us to consummate our initial business
combination and pay related fees and expenses, after first applying amounts
available to us from the trust account (after paying the deferred underwriting
discount and giving effect to any redemptions of public shares), plus any
additional amounts to be retained by the post-business combination company for
working capital or other purposes. To the extent that we obtain alternative
financing to fund our initial business combination, the aggregate commitment
under the forward purchase agreement will be reduced by the amount of such
alternative financing.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. Please see “Proposed Business—Permitted
purchases of our securities” for a description of how such persons will
determine from which stockholders to seek to acquire shares. The price per share
paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public
stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with
our initial business combination. However, such persons have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny
stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require
as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of
cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that
we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business
combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (b) with
respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24
months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter
agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares held by them
in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. In
addition, our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive
their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public
shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an
amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
have not consummated our initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have
also agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor
or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or
after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the
trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our
initial business combination within the prescribed time frame."

Concurrent Private Placement of approximately US$148.4 million, or approximately
US$160.8 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares in the form of ADSs for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented
employees by providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional
capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent
Private Placement for general corporate purposes, including research and
development, working capital needs, and increased regulatory capital
requirements of the HK SFC and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions as
a result of our business expansion.

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our
business, and our plans and business conditions. The foregoing represents our
current intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions to use
and allocate the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement. Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and
discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement. If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may
use the proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement
differently than as described in this prospectus. 

Pending any use of proceeds described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds
from this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement in short-term,
interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement,
we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations as an offshore holding company
to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital
contributions and to our VIE only through loans, subject to satisfaction of
applicable government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals
on a timely basis, if at all."

$86.9 million, or approximately $100.4 million if the underwriters exercise
their over-allotment option in full, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $32.6 million for sales and marketing activities to support the
  ongoing commercialization of our IVL System, including, but not limited to,
  the expansion of our sales force, additional medical affairs and educational
  efforts and the expansion of our international sales presence;

• approximately $15.5 million for research and development and clinical studies;
  and

• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Our ongoing clinical programs are intended to allow us to expand
commercialization of our products into new geographies and indications. Our
Disrupt PAD III clinical study, Disrupt PAD III observational study, Disrupt CAD
II clinical study, Disrupt CAD III clinical study and TAVL Chronic Feasibility
clinical study are currently enrolling, with enrollment expected to be completed
in the second half of 2019 for the Disrupt PAD III clinical study and Disrupt
PAD III observational study, the first half of 2019 for the Disrupt CAD II
clinical study, the second half of 2020 for the Disrupt CAD III clinical study
and the first half of 2019 for the TAVL Chronic Feasibility clinical study. Our
Disrupt CAD IV clinical study is currently in the early planning phase with
Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with available
borrowing under our current revolving line of credit from the 2018 Loan and
Security Agreement and the net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient
to fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months. However,
following this offering, we will require additional capital in order to achieve
our goals.

The foregoing use of proceeds discussion excludes the Concurrent Private
Placement. We estimate that the net proceeds from the Concurrent Private
Placement will be an aggregate of approximately $10.0 million. We intend to use
the net proceeds from the Concurrent Private Placement for working capital and
general corporate purposes. The sale of shares in the Concurrent Private
Placement will not be registered under the Securities Act. The closing of this
offering is not conditioned upon the closing of the Concurrent Private 
Placement. We expect the Concurrent Private Placement to close on March 11,
2019.

We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we
will receive from this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement.
Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds. Pending the
use of proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement as
described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive in this
offering and the Concurrent Private Placement in short-term and long-term
interest-bearing obligations, including government and investment-grade debt
securities and money market funds."

    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not 
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital have committed that they and/or their designees
will purchase the private units (for an aggregate purchase price of $6,150,000)
from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of
this offering. They have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is
exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they will purchase from us an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 72,000 private units) at
a price of $10.00 per private unit necessary to maintain in the trust account
$10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering. These additional private 
units will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously 
with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment 
option. The private units are identical to the units sold in this offering 
subject to certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus.
All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust
account described below.

$240,000,000, or $276,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account at Morgan Stanley maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held
in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities” within
the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity
of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to
us to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business
combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we
have not completed a business combination in the required time period. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Vogel Partners, LLP, an affiliate of Mr. Vogel, of a monthly fee
of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Vogel
Partners, LLP for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Vogel with
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the New York City metropolitan area, that the fee charged by
Vogel Partners, LLP is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our
initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, the payment of
consulting, success or finder fees to our sponsor, officers, directors, initial
stockholders or their affiliates in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination and the repayment of the $150,000 loan from Mr.
Vogel (none of which payments will be made from the proceeds of this offering
held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business
combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, initial
stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such entity and individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review
and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, officers,
directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director
abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit on the amount of
such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such
expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and
interest earned on the funds in the trust account that we are entitled to
withdraw, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an
initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$750,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our sponsor, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than
the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through 
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such 
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital upon
consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection
with our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is 
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business 
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any 
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the 
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in 
a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ 
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and 
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to advance us the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, Mr. Vogel has loaned us an aggregate of
$25,342, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee,
the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The note governing the loan is non-interest bearing
and is payable on the earlier to occur of November 1, 2019, the consummation of
this offering, or the abandonment of this offering. The loan will be payable
without interest. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 21 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers, directors and their affiliates may,
but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at
holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into units
at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the private
units. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may
use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay
such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for
such repayment.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer,
in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek
to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their
shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or
affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete a business combination within 21 months from the
closing of this offering. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the
approval of any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, whether proposed by our sponsor, initial stockholders, executive
officers, directors or any other person. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $261,000,000 (or $300,150,000
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full).

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of 
    February 28, 2019, we have borrowed $300,000 under the promissory note with
    our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. Any
    borrowed amounts will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions). In the event that offering
    expenses are more than as set forth in this table, they will be repaid using
    a portion of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust 
    account and set aside for post-closing working capital expenses. In the 
    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such
    amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.0%
    (or 6% in the case of proceeds from sales of units in connection with
    exercise of the over-allotment option) of the gross proceeds of this 
    offering. Upon completion of our initial business combination, $7.83 
    million, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to
    $10.18 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
    full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust 
    account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to the trustee to 
    pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay 
    all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with 
    which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate 
    purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness 
    incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the
    purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will
    not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting 
    discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination 
    target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement 
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and 
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.

(6) We will pay Mr. Petruska, our Chief Financial Officer, $29,000 per month
    for his services prior to the consummation of our initial business 
    combination, of which 40% is payable upon the successful completion of our
    initial business combination. Does not include the $500,000 fee payable to 
    Mr. Ethridge, our President and Chief Operating Officer, upon the successful
    completion of our initial business combination, as described elsewhere in
    this prospectus.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $263,610,000 (or $303,151,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $7.83 million (or $10.18 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $3.7 million per year,
assuming an interest rate of 1.4% per year; however, we can provide no assurance
regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, the
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will
not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the
completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public
shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of
this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account, as well as the proceeds from the sale of forward purchase shares
pursuant to the forward purchase agreement described elsewhere in this
prospectus, for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation
of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business 
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business 
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due 
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the 
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional 
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our 
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. 

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
February 28, 2019, we have borrowed $300,000 under the promissory note with our
sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of March 31, 2019
or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of offering proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

Nomura has entered into a forward purchase agreement with us, which provides for
the purchase by Nomura of our public shares for an aggregate purchase price of
$125 million through, other than as described below, open market purchases or
privately negotiated transactions with one or more third parties. In lieu of
purchasing an aggregate of $125 million of public shares in the open market or
privately negotiated transactions, up to $75 million of such aggregate purchase
price may instead be in the form of an investment in our equity securities on
terms to be mutually agreed between Nomura and us, to occur concurrently with
the closing of our initial business combination. The funds from the sale of the
forward purchase shares received by us may be used as part of the consideration
to the sellers in the initial business combination or for the working capital of
the combined company. The forward purchase agreement allows Nomura to be excused
from its purchase obligation in connection with a specific business combination,
in whole or in part, unless, within ten calendar days following written notice
delivered by us of our intention to enter into such business combination, Nomura
notifies us that it has decided to proceed with the purchase. Nomura may decide
not to proceed with the purchase for any reason, including, without limitation,
if it has determined that such purchase would constitute a conflict of interest.
Nomura’s forward purchase commitment will be reduced by the aggregate amount of
commitments by third parties to purchase our securities, if any, in private
placements to occur concurrently with the closing of our initial business
combination. The obligations under the forward purchase agreement are not
affected by any redemptions by our public stockholders of shares of our Class A
common stock. In connection with Hennessy III’s initial business combination,
Nomura agreed to provide all of the financing required to close the transaction
($125 million in convertible preferred and common equity). If we seek
stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct
redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the
tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or
their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately
negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the
completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number
of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with
applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments,
plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any
terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such 
transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession
of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such 
purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not 
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender 
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a 
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such 
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to 
purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to 
completion of our initial business combination.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

Our anchor investor has expressed to us an interest to purchase $32,500,000 of
public units in this offering and we have agreed to direct the underwriters to
sell to our anchor investor such number of public units. Further, our anchor
investor has agreed with us that, if it does not own the number of public shares
equal to 3,250,000 public shares, at the time of any stockholder vote with
respect to an initial business combination or the business day immediately prior
to the consummation of our initial business combination, it will transfer to our
sponsor a portion of the 740,351 founder shares (871,930 if the over-allotment
option is exercised in full) it purchased prior to this offering on a pro rata
basis, provided, however, that the anchor investor will not be obligated to
transfer to our sponsor any founder shares to the extent that its remaining
number of founder shares would be less than 185,088 (217,982 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full). There can be no assurance that our
anchor investor will acquire any public units in this offering or what amount of
equity our anchor investor will retain, if any, upon the consummation of our
initial business combination.

In the event that such anchor investor purchases such units (either in this
offering or after) and votes them in favor of our initial business combination
or Nomura purchases public shares in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions, it is possible that no votes from other public stockholders would
be required to approve our initial business combination, depending on the number
of shares that are present at the meeting to approve such transaction. As a
result of the founder shares and private placement warrants that our anchor
investor may hold, it may have different interests with respect to a vote on an
initial business combination than other public stockholders.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash 
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our initial stockholders or their affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. Permitted transferees of the founder shares held by our
sponsor, officers and directors or our anchor investor would be subject to the
same restrictions applicable to our sponsor, officers and directors or our
anchor investor, respectively."

proceeds from this offering of approximately US$3,957,641, if the minimum amount
is raised, and approximately US$8,482,641, if the maximum amount is raised,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated
offering expenses payable by us. These estimates are based upon an assumed
initial offering price of US$5 per ordinary share.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for general corporate purposes,
which may include investing in sales and marketing activities, product
development, technology research and development, establishing domestic and
international branches and subsidiaries as well as strategic reserve and other
general and administrative matters. The table below provides more detailed
information on our use of proceeds after we complete the remittance process. We
expect that 70% of the net proceeds from this offering will be used by our PRC
subsidiaries and VIE entity in the form of RMB and the rest of the net proceeds
will be used by us for the purposes discussed in this section, primarily
establishing U.S. operations. For the net proceeds of this offering to be used
in the form of RMB, we will have to convert any capital contributions or loans
to our PRC subsidiaries and VIE entity from U.S. dollars to RMB pursuant to
certain procedural requirements under regulations of the PRC State
Administration of Foreign Exchange.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws
and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries through loans or
capital contributions, and to our PRC consolidated VIE through loans, and only
if we satisfy the applicable government registration and approval requirements.
Current PRC laws and regulations set forth remittance requirements for
transferring funds from us, a British Virgin Islands company, to our PRC
subsidiaries. For example, if we transfer proceeds to our PRC subsidiaries via
capital contribution, our PRC subsidiaries will be required to complete the
filing procedures with the MOC. If we make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, the
principal amount of such loans cannot exceed the surplus between the total
investment in projects approved by the verifying governmental departments and
the registered capital or twice of net worth of the relevant PRC subsidiary. If
the proceeds are used to set up a new enterprise in China, we will be required
to complete the record-filing or approval and other requirements set forth in
the Interim Administrative Measures for the Record-filing of the Incorporation
and Change of Foreign-invested Enterprises (Revised in 2017).

We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements on a timely
basis, if at all.

As advised by Jingtian & Gongcheng, our PRC legal counsel, the above discussed
use of proceeds is within the currently applicable PRC statutory limitations,
subject to the procedural requirements discussed in this section. Based on the
advice of Jingtian & Gongcheng, upon the satisfaction of such procedural
requirements, we will be able to use 70% of our net proceeds from this offering
in the form of RMB through loans or capital contributions to our PRC
subsidiaries and VIE entity without increasing the registered capital and
approval investment amount of such entities.

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our
business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in
applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus supplement.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, financial instruments or demand deposits."

(3) This portion of net proceeds will be used by Beijing Huaxia Dadi Distance    
    Learning Services Co., Ltd. and other subsidiaries in Shanghai, Hunan, Hubei,
    Jiangsu and Guizhou for marketing and advertising efforts of these entities.
 
(4) This portion of net proceeds will be used by Beijing Huaxia Dadi Distance    
    Learning Services Co., Ltd. and Beijing HuaXiaDaDi Digital Information       
    Technology Co., Ltd. for working capital purposes.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws
and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries through loans or
capital contributions, and to our PRC consolidated VIE through loans, and only
if we satisfy the applicable government registration and approval requirements.
Current PRC laws and regulations set forth remittance requirements for
transferring funds from us, a British Virgin Islands company, to our PRC
subsidiaries. For example, if we transfer proceeds to our PRC subsidiaries via
capital contribution, our PRC subsidiaries will be required to complete the
filing procedures with the MOC. If we make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, the
principal amount of such loans cannot exceed the surplus between the total
investment in projects approved by the verifying governmental departments and
the registered capital or twice of net worth of the relevant PRC subsidiary. If
the proceeds are used to set up a new enterprise in China, we will be required
to complete the record-filing or approval and other requirements set forth in
the Interim Administrative Measures for the Record-filing of the Incorporation
and Change of Foreign-invested Enterprises (Revised in 2017).

We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements on a timely
basis, if at all.

As advised by Jingtian & Gongcheng, our PRC legal counsel, the above discussed
use of proceeds is within the currently applicable PRC statutory limitations,
subject to the procedural requirements discussed in this section. Based on the
advice of Jingtian & Gongcheng, upon the satisfaction of such procedural
requirements, we will be able to use 70% of our net proceeds from this offering
in the form of RMB through loans or capital contributions to our PRC
subsidiaries and VIE entity without increasing the registered capital and
approval investment amount of such entities.

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our
business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in
applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus supplement.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, financial instruments or demand deposits."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    February 15, 2019, we had borrowed $150,803 under the promissory note with
    our sponsor. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the 
    payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and 
    amounts not to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering 
    expenses are less than as set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the 
    offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such
    excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. If the over-allotment option is
    exercised, 5.5% of the gross proceeds from the over-allotment ($0.55 per 
    unit or up to $2,153,250 in the aggregate) will be deposited in the trust 
    account as deferred underwriting commissions. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $9,135,000, which constitutes the underwriter's 
    deferred commissions (or $11,288,250 if the underwriter's over-allotment 
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, 
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The 
    underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred 
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed 
    estimates.

(5) We estimate that our out-of-pocket expenses for this offering will be
    approximately $750,000, $470,000 of which the representative has agreed to
    reimburse us for at the closing of the offering. The proceeds after offering
    expenses includes the $470,000 reimbursement from the representative.

(6) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately 
    $3,654,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in 
    the trust account over 12 months following the investment of such funds in 
    specified U.S. Government Treasury bills, however, we can provide no 
    assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes no exercise of the 
    underwriter's overallotment option and an interest rate of 1.4% per annum 
    based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be 
    invested. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection 
    with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate 
    of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not 
    obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial 
    business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds
    of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid 
    only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our 
    initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the 
    working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
    but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned 
    amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at
    a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
    be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The 
    terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of
    our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
    agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans
    from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do
    not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
    waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust 
    account.

(7) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.

The rules of the NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from
this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the
net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
$261,000,000 (or $300,150,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full), including $9,135,000 (or up to $11,288,250 if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the
consummation of this offering, be invested only in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Based on current interest
rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $3,654,000 per year, assuming no exercise of the over-allotment
option and an interest rate of 1.4% per year, following the investment of such
funds in specified U.S. government treasury bills or in specified money market
funds. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest
held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if
any, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i)
the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any
public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend
our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify
the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if
we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
shareholders' rights or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the
redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space,
administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
February 15, 2019, we had borrowed $150,803 under the promissory note with our
sponsor. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of December 31, 2019 or the closing of this offering. These loans will
be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the offering proceeds not
held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our
officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from
parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any such 
transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder 
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, 
they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any 
material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases
are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently 
anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject
to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the 
purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are 
subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination (so
that we are not subject to the SEC's “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (B)
with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders' rights or
pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24
months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in
connection with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition,
our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to

A common stock in this offering will be approximately $83.0 million, based upon
the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions.

The selling stockholders expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $11.9
million from the sale of shares of Class A common stock in this offering, based
upon the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions payable by the selling stockholders (or
if the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option, the selling
stockholders will receive net proceeds of approximately $26.1 million). We will
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders,
including any shares sold to the underwriters upon exercise of their right to
purchase additional shares of Class A common stock. 

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to purchase 5,250,000
Common Units directly from Greenlane Holdings, LLC at a purchase price per
Common Unit equal to the initial public offering price per share of Class A
common stock, less underwriting discounts and commissions.

Greenlane Holdings, LLC will receive an estimated $80.4 million in net proceeds
from the sale of Common Units to Greenlane Holdings, Inc., after deducting
estimated unpaid offering costs of $2.6 million of the total estimated offering
costs of $3.5 million. We intend to cause Greenlane Holdings, LLC to use
approximately $2.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering for capital
improvements to our warehouses and other facilities and for capital expenditures
relating to our information technology systems. We intend to cause Greenlane
Holdings, LLC to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for
working capital and general corporate purposes, including to fund possible
investments in, and acquisitions of, complementary companies or their assets,
businesses, partnerships, minority investments, products or technologies.
However, we currently have no commitments or agreements regarding any such
acquisitions or investments.

While we intend to allocate the net funds available to Greenlane Holdings, LLC
for the purposes outlined above, there may be circumstances under which, for
sound business reasons, a reallocation of funds may be necessary. As a result,
our board of directors and management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. 

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering in our business, such funds will
be managed through a treasury management program under the supervision of our
Chief Financial Officer and invested in short-term, interest-bearing
investments, which may include interest-bearing bank accounts, money market
funds, certificates of deposit and U.S. government securities.

In addition, in an effort to reduce our interest expense on our bank line of
credit, we may use such net proceeds to repay all or a portion of our borrowings
under our line of credit, but only if we will be permitted under our line of
credit to re-borrow such amounts, and to use such funds when required for one or
more of the purposes outlined above."

underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, based

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $20.0 million to advance HB-101 through completion of our
  ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial;

• approximately $40.0 million to advance HB-201 and HB-202 into and through 
  completion of Phase 1 clinical trials;

• approximately $27.0 million to advance HB-301 into and through completion of a
  Phase 1 clinical trial;

• approximately $20.0 million for ongoing research and development activities 
  related to next generation programs; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Based on our current plans, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund
our operations for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on 
assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available 
capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from preclinical studies or clinical
trials we may commence in the future, as well as any collaborations that we may
enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen
cash needs. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license,
acquire, or invest in additional businesses, technologies, products or assets,
although currently we have no specific agreements, commitments or understandings
in this regard. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation instruments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities."

at either a fixed rate equal to the base rate plus 4.50% or an adjusted LIBOR
rate (subject to a 1.00% floor) plus 5.50%, at our election. At December 31,
2018, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility
was 7.71%. The outstanding borrowings under our credit facility were incurred to
repay the outstanding debt under our prior revolving credit facility and to fund
mineral and royalty acquisitions. As of April 5, 2019, we had $200 million of

exercised, we intend to contribute all of the net proceeds therefrom to Brigham

operating expenses through at least the next 18 months, through our expected
initial data release from the planned Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 and early
Phase 1 clinical development for TPX-0022 and TPX-0046. It is difficult to
predict the cost and timing required to complete our clinical trials due to,
among other factors, our lack of experience with initiating and conducting
clinical trials, the rate of patient enrollment in our clinical trials, filing
requirements with regulatory agencies, clinical trial results, and the actual
costs of manufacturing and supplying our drug candidates. The expected net
proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our drug candidates
through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to
complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. We expect
to finance our cash needs primarily through equity offerings and potentially
through debt financings, collaborations, license and development agreements. We
have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we
could expend our available capital resources at a rate greater than we currently
expect.

are less than expected.

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $125,000,000 (or $143,750,000
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full).

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    December 31, 2018, we had borrowed $50,000 (of up to $300,000 available to 
    us) under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of 
    the expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon completion
    of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting 
    commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than as set forth
    in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the $1,000,000 of 
    offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside for 
    post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering expenses 
    are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for 
    post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement 
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a 
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and 
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement units be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement units, $125,000,000 (or $143,750,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be placed in a trust account in
the United States at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S.
government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$1,875,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year; however, we can
provide no assurance regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay
our franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and
the sale of the private placement units will not be released from the trust
account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial
business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted
in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, and (c) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements
we may enter into following consummation of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
December 31, 2018, we had borrowed $50,000 under the promissory note with our
sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is
non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of December 31, 2019 or
the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the offering proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such working capital loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent
units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. Such units
would be identical to the private placement units, including as to exercise
price, exercisability and exercise period of the underlying warrants. The terms
of such working capital loans by our sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers
and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist
with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

Prior to this offering, an affiliate of our sponsor entered into a forward
purchase agreement with us which provides for the purchase by it (or its
designees) of an aggregate of 2,500,000 units for an aggregate purchase price of
$25,000,000 in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of our
initial business combination.

The proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase units may be used as part of
the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination, expenses
in connection with our initial business combination or for working capital in
the post-transaction company. The forward purchase will be required to be made
regardless of whether any Class A common stock is redeemed by our public
stockholders and is intended to provide us with minimum funding level for our
initial business combination.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 18 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination
within 18 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable
law and as further described herein and any limitations (including but not
limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares
held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business
combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their
rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any
founder shares or private placement shares held by them if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if
our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."
"GUARDION HEALTH SCIENCES, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/guardion-health-sciences-inc-965807-88246,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/guardion-health-sciences-inc-965807-88246,424B4,4/8/2019,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13350292,"The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares it is
offering will be approximately $3.9 million. If the underwriters fully exercise
the over-allotment option, the net proceeds of the shares the Company sells will
be approximately $4.6 million. “Net proceeds” is what the Company expects to
receive after deducting the underwriting discount and commission and estimated
offering expenses payable by the Company.

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to conduct
operations, increase marketing efforts, increase investment in the Company’s
existing business initiatives and products and for general working capital. The
Company anticipates budgeting approximately $3.0 million of the proceeds from
the offering for conducting operations and for working capital. Working capital
expenditures will include, but are not limited to, employee benefit expenses,
insurance expenses, license fees, facility costs and maintenance of inventory
levels, and research and studies. The Company anticipates that approximately
$0.1 million of the proceeds from the offering will be used to repay a
promissory note issued in March 2019. The promissory note bears interest at a
rate of ten percent (10%) per annum and matures on June 10, 2019. The balance of
the proceeds are intended to be used for a number of business initiatives,
including but not limited to commercialization and production costs of new
equipment and devices (approximately $0.2 million), the purchase of additional
Transcranial Doppler devices and other costs related to the roll-out of the
transcranial doppler ultrasound services business (approximately $0.3 million)
and recruitment of senior brand team leaders with the appropriate support level
employees for increased marketing efforts (approximately $0.3 million).

The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to
acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, or technologies, or to
obtain the right to use such complementary technologies. The Company has no
commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment and is not currently
involved in any negotiations with respect to any such transactions.

As of the date of this prospectus, the Company cannot specify with certainty all
of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion
of this offering. The amounts and timing of its actual expenditures will depend
on numerous factors, including the status of its product development efforts,
sales and marketing activities, technological advances, amount of cash generated
or used by its operations and competition. Accordingly, the Company’s management
will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors
will be relying on the judgment of its management regarding the application of
the proceeds of this offering."
NGM BIOPHARMACEUTICALS INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/ngm-biopharmaceuticals-inc-769784-88015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/ngm-biopharmaceuticals-inc-769784-88015,424B1,4/4/2019,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13346375,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $95.7 million, or
approximately $110.6 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, from the sale of the shares of common stock
offered by us in this offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Additionally, we
estimate that our net proceeds from the concurrent private placement to Merck
will be $65.9 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds of this offering, together with our existing cash,
cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, for the following
purposes:

• approximately $95.0 to $105.0 million to fund the further development of the 
  NGM282 program and related product candidates;                        

• approximately $45.0 to $55.0 million to fund the development of our other 
  programs, including our early-stage drug discovery programs and
  pre-commercialization activities; and                                     

• the remainder for working capital and general operating expenses.

We expect to decide whether to advance NGM386 and/or NGM395 following our
analysis of the results of the NGM386 Phase 1 trial.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire,
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.
However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and the funding we
expect to receive under the initial term of our existing agreement with Merck,
will be sufficient to fund our operations through 2020, or through 2021 with the
additional proceeds from the concurrent private placement to Merck. In
particular, we expect that these funds will allow us to complete our ongoing
Phase 2 and planned Phase 2b clinical trials and begin preparation for Phase 3
clinical trials of NGM282 for NASH.

Following this offering, we will require substantial capital to complete
clinical development, seek regulatory approval of and, if approved,
commercialize NGM282 and our other programs. For each compound subject to our 
agreement with Merck, Merck has a one-time option to obtain an exclusive, 
worldwide license. If Merck chooses to exercise its option with respect to a 
compound, from that point forward all development costs relating to that 
compound will be paid for by Merck, unless we elect to exercise our worldwide 
cost and profit sharing option at the commencement of Phase 3 testing, at which
point we would be responsible for a portion of the future development expense. 
We will incur additional expenses for the development of any compound for which
Merck does not exercise its option, for which Merck elects to terminate its 
license, such as NGM386 and NGM395, or for which we elect to exercise our 
worldwide cost and profit sharing option. We may seek additional funds through 
public or private equity, debt financings or other sources, including strategic
collaborations. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital
significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more
money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and other development
efforts for our product candidates and other factors as well as the amount of 
cash we use in our operations. As a result, our management will have broad 
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying
on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering.
In addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or

sources of cash are less than expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."
SILK ROAD MEDICAL INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/silk-road-medical-inc-742352-89083,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/silk-road-medical-inc-742352-89083,424B4,4/4/2019,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13346367,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately
$109.1 million based upon the initial public offering price of $20.00 per share,
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us, net of actual payments of offering expenses of
$233,000 as of December 31, 2018. We will not receive any net proceeds from the
sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares, which are expected to be
approximately $16.7 million if such option is exercised in full.

The principal purpose of this offering is to provide us with additional capital.
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to expand our sales force
and operations, increase our research and development activities, conduct or
sponsor clinical studies and trials, expand internationally, and provide for
working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may use a portion of
the net proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies, intellectual
property or businesses; however, we currently do not have any agreements or
commitments to complete any such transactions and are not involved in
negotiations regarding such transactions.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty the specific
allocations or all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received
upon the completion of this offering. Accordingly, our management and board of
directors will have broad discretion in the application and specific allocations
of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management and board of directors regarding the application of the proceeds of
this offering.

These expected uses represent our current intentions based upon our present
plans and market conditions. The amounts we actually expend in these areas, and
the timing thereof, may vary significantly from our current intentions and will
depend upon a number of factors, including future sales growth, success of
research and product development efforts, cash generated from future operations
and actual expenses to operate our business.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments,
money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and U.S.
government securities."

Class A common stock in this offering will be approximately $1,009.8 million,
and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full
their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, we expect to
receive approximately $1,161.3 million of net proceeds.

We estimate that the offering expenses will be approximately $12.1 million. All
of such offering expenses will be paid for or otherwise borne by TWM LLC using
cash on hand.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to purchase
40,000,000 issued and outstanding LLC Interests (or 46,000,000 LLC Interests, if
the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock) from certain of the Bank Stockholders (and cancel the
corresponding shares of common stock), at a purchase price per interest equal to
the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock, less the
underwriting discounts and commissions payable thereon. Many of the Bank
Stockholders are affiliates of the underwriters. As a result of the purchases of
LLC Interests (together with the cancellation of the corresponding shares of
common stock) described above, the number of outstanding shares of common stock
will be reduced. Because we will hold the LLC Interests that we purchase (and
thereby increase our ownership position in TWM LLC), the number of outstanding
LLC Interests will remain the same."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of
    loans from our sponsor of up to $250,000 as described in this prospectus. As
    of December 31, 2018, we had not borrowed any amount under the promissory
    note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this
    offering. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of
    the $1,500,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust account. In the
    event that offering expenses are less than as set forth in this table, any
    such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the
    event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table,
    we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The amount of gross proceeds subject to underwriting discounts and
    commissions will exclude the gross proceeds received on 2,500,000 units
    which will be sold to affiliates of our sponsor, which units are not subject
    to any underwriting discounts or commissions. The underwriters have agreed
    to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of
    this offering. Upon completion of our initial business combination,
    $7,875,000, which constitutes the underwriters' deferred commissions
    (or up to $9,187,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised
    in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust
    account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to
    pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses
    with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate
    purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness
    incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the
    purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will
    not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting
    discounts and commissions.

(4) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed
    estimates.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from
    the trust account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect
    approximately $3,500,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the
    funds held in the trust account over the 12 months following the closing of
    this offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.
    This estimate assumes an interest rate of 1.4% per annum based upon current
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In
    addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
    intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
    sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated
    to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
    combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the
    trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only
    out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial
    business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
    capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
    proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts.
    Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price
    of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be
    identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The
    terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written
    agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans
    from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do
    not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
    waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust
    account.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a ""no shop"" provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a
trust account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $250,000,000 (or $287,500,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $7,875,000 (or up to
$9,187,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering,
be placed in a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee. The funds in the trust account will be invested only
in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Based on current
interest rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will
be approximately $3,500,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.4% per
year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held
in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any,
the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account
until the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business
combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or
(B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders' rights or
pre-initial business combination activity; and (3) the redemption of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within
24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on
current interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the trust account will
be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our
initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for
using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to loan funds
to, or invest in, us.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$250,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
December 31, 2018, we had not borrowed any amount under the promissory note with
our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of the
date hereof, we have borrowed $250,000 under the promissory note. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30, 2019
or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon completion of
this offering out of the $1,500,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have
not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an
affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to
loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access
to funds in our trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any such
transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions,
they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any
material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases
are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently
anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject
to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the
purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are
subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC's ""penny
stock"" rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require
as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of
cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that
we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business
combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering
or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders' rights or
pre-initial business combination activity; and (3) the redemption of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within
24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. In no
other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination. Our directors and officers have
entered into letter agreements similar to the one signed by our initial
shareholders with respect to public shares acquired by them, if any. In
addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

approximately US$112.9 million, or approximately US$118.1 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us and based upon the initial public offering price of
US$12.50 per ADS.

We plan to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering as follows:

• approximately 40%, for identifying additional monetization channels and
  pursuing strategic investments in our industry;

• approximately 30%, for identifying and cultivating KOLs;

• approximately 20%, for investing in technology, AI solutions and big data
  analytics; and

• the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

The foregoing represents our intentions as of the date of this prospectus with
respect of the use and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based
upon our present plans and business conditions, but our management will have
significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of the
offering.

The occurrence of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in
application of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described
in this prospectus.

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not
immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds
in short-term, interest bearing, debt instruments or bank deposits.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we, as an offshore holding company,
are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction
of applicable government registration and approval requirements, we may extend
inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiary or make additional capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiary to fund its capital expenditures or working
capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders."
"POWERBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/powerbridge-technologies-co-ltd-1073569-88724,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/powerbridge-technologies-co-ltd-1073569-88724,424B4,4/2/2019,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13336653,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the sale of Ordinary Shares
of approximately up to $7.3 million, based upon an Offering Price of $5 per
share, and assuming no exercise of the overallotment and after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses; our net proceeds will increase to $8.5 million if the over-allotment
is exercised in full.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this Offering as follows:

. Approximately 35% for research and development;

. Approximately 25% sales and marketing effort;

. Approximately 20% reserved for strategic alliances and acquisitions

. Approximately 20% for working capital and general corporate purposes.

The precise amounts and percentage of proceeds we would devote to particular
categories of activity will depend on prevailing market and business conditions
as well as particular opportunities that may arise from time to time. This
expected use of our net proceeds from this Offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including any unforeseen cash needs. Similarly, the priority of our prospective
uses of proceeds will depend on business and market conditions are they develop.
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility and broad
discretion in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event
occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this Offering
differently than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds of this Offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiary and branches only through
loans or capital contributions. None of the proceeds of this Offering can be
loaned or contributed to our PRC subsidiary without additional government
registration or approval. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans or
make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary and branches to fund
its capital expenditures or working capital. There is, in effect, no statutory
limit on the amount of capital contribution that we can make to our PRC
subsidiary. This is because there are no statutory limits on the amount of
registered capital for our PRC subsidiary, and we are allowed to make capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiary by subscribing for its initial registered
capital and increased registered capital, provided that the PRC subsidiary
completes the relevant necessary filing and registration procedures in
accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. With respect to loans to
the PRC subsidiary by us, (i) if the relevant PRC subsidiary determines to adopt
the traditional foreign exchange administration mechanism, or the current
foreign debt mechanism, the outstanding amount of the loans shall not exceed the
difference between the total investment and the registered capital of the PRC
subsidiary and there is, in effect, no statutory limits on the amount of loans
that we can make to our PRC subsidiary under this circumstance since we can
increase the registered capital of our PRC subsidiary by making capital
contributions to them, subject to the completion of relevant registrations, and
the difference between the total investment and the registered capital will
increase accordingly; and (ii) if the relevant PRC subsidiary determines to
adopt the foreign exchange administration mechanism as provided in the Notice of
the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”) on Full-coverage Macro-prudent Management of
Cross-border Financing (the “PBOC Notice No. 9”), the risk-weighted outstanding
amount of the loans, which shall be calculated based on the formula provided in
the PBOC Notice No. 9, shall not exceed 200% of the net asset of the relevant
PRC subsidiary. According to the PBOC Notice No. 9, after a transition period of
one year since the promulgation of the PBOC Notice No. 9, the PBOC and SAFE will
determine the cross-border financing administration mechanism for the
foreign-invested enterprises after evaluating the overall implementation of the
PBOC Notice No. 9. As of the date hereof, neither PBOC nor SAFE has promulgated
and made public any further rules, regulations, notices or circulars in this
regard. It is uncertain which mechanism will be adopted by PBOC and SAFE in the
future and what statutory limits will be imposed on us when providing loans to
our PRC subsidiary.

According to the relevant PRC laws and regulations, in terms of capital
contributions, it typically takes about eight weeks to complete the relevant
filings and registrations. In terms of loans, the SAFE registration process
typically takes about four weeks to complete, provided that all the necessary
procedures could be successfully consummated by the relevant PRC subsidiary, as
case may be, and/or our company. While we currently see no material obstacles to
completing the filing and registration procedures with respect to future capital
contributions and loans to our PRC subsidiary, we cannot assure you that we will
be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis,
if at all. It is likely that we will need to convert some of our net proceeds in
U.S. dollars into Renminbi in order to use as proceeds as contemplated in this
section.

Pending remitting the Offering proceeds to the PRC, we intend to invest our net
proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations.

Although we may use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or
investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our
business, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter
into any acquisitions or make any investments. We cannot assure you that we will
make any acquisitions or investments in the future."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and

    received from our sponsor for the founder shares.                          
  
(2) Assuming all of the gross proceeds of the offering were raised through     
    underwriter’s effort. No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect
    to the purchase of the private warrants. In the event we raise up to       
    $15,000,000 in this offering through our own effort, the underwriting      
    discount on such proceeds shall be reduced to 0.1%.                        

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at 
    approximately $2,000,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. Does not 
    include interest earned on the trust proceeds that may be available to us, 
    as described elsewhere in this prospectus.                                 

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may  
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in  
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital. 

Our sponsor has committed to purchase from us an aggregate of 5,000,000 private
warrants at $1.00 per warrant (for a total purchase price of $5,000,000) in a
private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this
offering. Our sponsor has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is
exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, it will purchase from us
additional private warrants (up to a maximum of 375,000 private warrants) at a
price of $1.00 per private warrant in an amount that is necessary to maintain in
the trust account at $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering. These
additional private warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will
occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of
the over-allotment option. The founder’s units are identical to the units sold
in this offering subject to certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in
this prospectus. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be
placed in the trust account described below.

$100,000,000, or $115,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants will be
placed in a trust account at Morgan Stanley, N.A., maintained by American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in
trust will be invested only in United States “government securities” within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraph
(d) under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed
to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with
respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us to pay our tax obligations and dissolution expenses, the proceeds
will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion
of a business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public
shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time
period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

Other than the monthly fees and equity awards payable to officers and directors
for their services to us as described elsewhere in this prospectus, no
compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, initial stockholders,
officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered
to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
entity and individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review and approve all
reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers,
directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director
abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit on the amount of
such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such
expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business
combination. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$2,000,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants or advisors to assist us with our search for a target
business, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers
and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole
or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held
in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination
(including to pay converting stockholders as described herein) will be disbursed
to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not
expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account
and any available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we
are permitted to withdraw.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 12 months (or up to 18 months if we
extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full
amount of time), assuming that a business combination is not consummated during
that time. However, if necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs
following the consummation of this offering, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time
to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole
discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would
either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without
interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be
converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be
identical to the private warrants. If we do not complete a business combination,
the loans will be forgiven.

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated articles of
incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 12 months from the closing of this offering(or up to 18 months from the
closing of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a
business combination by the full amount of time) or (B) with respect to any
other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination
activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable
to complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of this
offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the
period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time),
subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."
"IDEAYA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/ideaya-biosciences-inc-1002272-89541,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/ideaya-biosciences-inc-1002272-89541,424B4,5/24/2019,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13452120,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of 5,000,000 shares of our
common stock in this offering will be approximately $43.3 million at the initial
public offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $50.2 million at the
initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, as
follows:

• approximately $27.0 million to $32.0 million to fund the clinical development
  of IDE196 (our protein kinase C, or PKC, inhibitor), including potential
  milestone payments to Novartis, through (i) completion of enrollment and
  interim data of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple solid tumor
  indications based on a tissue-type agnostic basket trial design for patients
  with solid tumors that have mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, or PKC gene fusions,
  as well as (ii) completion of preclinical evaluation for potential therapeutic
  use in NSCLC for patients having tumors with resistance to an EGFR inhibitor
  mediated by PKC, as well as (iii) completion of preclinical evaluation, and
  subject to satisfactory results from such preclinical evaluation, initiation
  of a clinical trial evaluating IDE196 in combination with one or more
  additional anti-cancer agent(s) in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma; 

• approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million to fund the preclinical and
  clinical development of product candidates in our synthetic lethality
  pipeline, including MAT2A through initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial,
  and for one or more of our Pol-theta, PARG and WRN programs, through lead 
  compound designation and IND-enabling studies, and development activities 
  related to diagnostics associated with our product candidates; and

• the balance for early target discovery and validation, including with our
  synthetic lethality target discovery platform, working capital and general
  corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds and our existing cash,
cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities to in-license, acquire or
invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets. However,
we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

Due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory
approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts
of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes.
As such, our management will retain broad discretion over the use of the net
proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors, including: (i) the time and cost necessary to
advance our product candidates through Phase 1 clinical trials and future
clinical trials; (ii) the timing and costs associated with the manufacture and
supply of product candidates for clinical development or commercialization;
(iii) the time and cost associated with our research and development activities
for our synthetic lethality pipeline; and (iv) our ability to obtain regulatory
approval for and subsequently commercialize our product candidates.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable
securities will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least 12
months following the date of this offering. After this offering, we will require
substantial capital in order to advance IDE196 and our other product candidates
and any other future product candidates through clinical trials, regulatory
approval and, if approved, commercialization. We may seek to obtain this
additional capital through public or private equity or debt financings or other
sources, such as strategic collaborations.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities."

the sale of 38,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus after deducting
the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses. Our estimate assumes the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
common units is not exercised. We intend to contribute the net proceeds from
this offering to Rattler LLC in return for a number of Rattler LLC Units equal
to the number of common units issued, representing approximately 25% of Rattler
LLC’s outstanding membership interests after this offering. Our Rattler LLC
Units will entitle us to sole management and control of Rattler LLC. We intend
for Rattler LLC to distribute all of the net proceeds from this offering to
Diamondback, in part to reimburse Diamondback for certain capital expenditures.

If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common
units, we estimate that the additional proceeds to us will be approximately
$94.8 million, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions. If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional common units, we will contribute the net proceeds thereof to
Rattler LLC in return for a number of Rattler LLC Units equal to the number of
common units purchased pursuant to the option. We intend for Rattler LLC to use
the proceeds of any exercise of the underwriters’ option to make an additional
cash distribution to Diamondback.

In connection with the closing of this offering, Diamondback will contribute
$1.0 million in cash to us and our general partner will contribute $1.0 million
in cash to us in respect of its general partner interest. We will retain those
contributions at the partnership, and use them for general partnership purposes."

this offering will be approximately $53.0 million based upon an initial public
offering price of $14.00 per ADS, and after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $61.5 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for the 
ADSs, and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets and 
obtain additional capital. We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with our existing cash, as follows:

• approximately $35.0 million to $40.0 million to complete preparation for Phase
  II and III clinical development of BT1718, including manufacturing activities,
  and to advance BT5528 and BT8009 through Phase I and IIa clinical development;

• approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million to advance our CD137 programs 
  through preclinical development, including IND-enabling studies, and to 
  advance one CD137 multimeric program through Phase I clinical development; and
 
• approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million on continued drug discovery
  efforts and translational research;

• the remainder on further expansion of our infrastructure to support our 
  pipeline as well as to fund working capital and other general corporate
  purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions.
As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical 
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical
studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in 
the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third 
parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, 
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net 
proceeds from this offering and may change the allocation of use of these 
proceeds among the uses described above. An investor will not have the 
opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we
base our decisions on how to use the proceeds.

We may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the acquisition or
licensing, as the case may be, of additional technologies, other assets or 
businesses, or for other strategic investments or opportunities, although we 
have no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so at this time.
Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments, or hold as cash."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    March 31, 2019, we had borrowed $150,000 under the promissory note with our
    sponsor. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of
    the proceeds that have been allocated for the payment of offering expenses
    (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in the 
    trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set 
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.

(2) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial 
    business combination, $8,750,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s 
    deferred commissions will be paid to the underwriter from the funds held in
    the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released by the 
    trustee to pay redeeming shareholders, will be released to us and can be 
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, 
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. If the 
    underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised, $0.55 per over-allotment 
    option unit, or up to $2,062,500 in the aggregate, will be deposited in the
    trust account as deferred underwriting commissions. The underwriter will not
    be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts
    and commissions.

(3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and 
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $250,000,000 (or $287,500,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $8,750,000 (or $10,812,500 if the
underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $3,500,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 1.4% per year; however, we can provide no assurance
regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, the
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will
not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the
completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public
shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering As of March
31, 2019, we had borrowed $150,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor to
be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are 
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30, 2019 or
the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this 
offering out of offering proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination. 

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net
tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon
consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of
underwriter’s fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s
“penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the initial business combination, and instead may search for an alternate 
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."
"FASTLY, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/fastly-inc-948580-89485,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/fastly-inc-948580-89485,424B4,5/17/2019,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13440009,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of shares of our
Class A common stock in this offering will be approximately $150.9 million, or
approximately $174.5 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, based upon an assumed initial public
offering price of $15.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on
the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$15.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of
this prospectus, would increase or decrease the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $10.5 million, assuming that the number of shares
offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the
same, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. We may also increase or decrease the number of
shares we are offering. A 1,000,000 share increase or decrease in the number of
shares offered by us would increase or decrease the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $14.0 million, assuming that the assumed initial
offering price to the public remains the same, and after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We do
not expect that a change in the initial offering price to the public or the
number of shares by these amounts would have a material effect on uses of the
proceeds from this offering, although it may accelerate the time at which we
will need to seek additional capital.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock, and facilitate
our future access to the capital markets. Although we have not yet determined
with certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for working
capital and other general corporate purposes. We may use a portion of the net
proceeds we receive from this offering to repay up to approximately $47.5 
million of indebtedness under our credit facilities, which, to date, has been 
used for general operating expenses, including personnel related costs as we
expanded our employee base, and capital expenditures for our network. We may 
also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for acquisitions or
strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies. We do not
currently have any plans for any such acquisitions or investments. We have not
allocated specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes.

$27.5 million of the outstanding indebtedness that we may repay under our credit
facilities is scheduled to mature in November 2021 and interest on such amount
accrues at a rate of prime plus 1.75%. $20.0 million of the outstanding
indebtedness that we may repay under our credit facilities is scheduled to
mature in December 2021 and interest on such amount accrues at a rate of prime
plus 4.25%.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on
many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of
our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

concurrent private placement to Louis Dreyfus Company B.V. of approximately
US$571.2 million, or approximately US$650.8 million if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement to Louis Dreyfus Company B.V. for general corporate purposes, which
may include store network expansion, customer acquisition, research and
development, sales and marketing, investment in our technology infrastructure,
working capital, and other general and administrative matters. In utilizing the
proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement to Louis
Dreyfus Company B.V., we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide
funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, and
to our consolidated VIE only through loans, and only if we satisfy the
applicable government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to meet these requirements on a timely basis, if at
all. We expect that all the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement to Louis Dreyfus Company B.V. will be used in the PRC in the
form of RMB and mainly by funding our PRC subsidiaries through capital 
contributions. In general, the relevant registration and approval procedures for
capital contributions typically take approximately eight weeks to complete and
there is no statutory limit on the amount of capital contributions under PRC 
laws and regulations. We currently see no material obstacles in completing the
registration and approval procedures with respect to future capital 
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, financial instruments or demand deposits."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and 
    a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    borrowed from AGBA Holding Limited, described below. These funds will be 
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. If we determine
    not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would not be repaid.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to Maxim Group LLC 
    in an amount of up to 4.0% of the total gross proceeds raised in the 
    offering described below.                                  

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $500,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.                                 

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not 
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital. 

Our sponsor has agreed to purchase an aggregate of 210,000 private units at a
price of $10.00 per private unit ($2,100,000 in the aggregate) in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our
sponsor has further agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the
underwriters, it will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per private unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 15,000 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least
$10.00 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless
of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These
additional private units will be purchased in a private placement that will
occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of
the over-allotment option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account described below.

$40,000,000, or $46,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at Morgan Stanley in the United States, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Pursuant to the investment management trust agreement that will govern the
investment of such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will
direct Morgan Stanley to invest the funds as set forth in such written
instructions and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise
instructed in accordance with the investment management trust agreement. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or
other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination to the extent not used to pay converting shareholders. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business.

The payment to AGBA Holding Limited, a company owned by our insiders, of a
monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. However, pursuant to the terms
of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination
by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to
pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business
combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and
payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business
combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by AGBA Holding Limited for our
benefit. We believe that the fee charged by AGBA Holding Limited is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination
or the distribution of the trust account to our public shareholders. Other than
the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s,
consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers,
directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any
services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine
their operations. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto. If the
payment of our liabilities, including the deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions payable to Maxim Group LLC in an amount up to 4.0% of the total
gross proceeds raised in the offering, were to reduce the amount available to us
in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or sell their shares
to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we would not be able
to consummate such transaction. To the extent that our share capital is used in
whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds
held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination, to pay holders who wish to convert their shares into a portion of
the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses relating thereto will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, AGBA Holding Limited, our
sponsor, has agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such
liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than $18,500) and has agreed
not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of December 31, 2018, our sponsor had loaned to us an aggregate of $72,515 to
be used to pay formation and a portion of the expenses of this offering. The
loan is payable without interest on the date on which we consummate our initial
public offering. If we determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts
would not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into private units at a price of
$10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued
units to acquire 55,000 ordinary shares (which includes 5,000 shares issuable
upon conversion of rights) and warrants to purchase 25,000 ordinary shares if
$500,000 of notes were so converted). If we do not complete our initial business
combination, the loans would be repaid out of funds not held in the trust
account, and only to the extent available.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination
within the required time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such
public shares or sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection
with a business combination which we consummate or in connection with an
amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
prior to the consummation of an initial business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

$34.0 million (or approximately $39.6 million if the underwriters exercise in 
full their option to purchase up to 600,000 additional shares of common stock to
cover over-allotments), after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, establish a public market for our common stock and to 
facilitate future access to the public equity markets by us, our employees and
our stockholders, obtain additional capital to support our operations and
increase our visibility in the marketplace.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with 
our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $30 million to fund our pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial for 
  AT-001 for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy;

• approximately $5 million to advance AT-007 for the treatment of galactosemia 
  in adults through our planned Phase 1 clinical trial;

• approximately $4 million to advance AT-003 for the treatment of diabetic 
  retinopathy into our planned Phase 1 clinical trial; and

• the remainder to fund other research and development activities, working
  capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets. 
However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based on our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Further, due
to the uncertainties inherent in the drug development process, it is difficult
to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this
offering that may be used for the above purposes.

Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering, and our investors will be relying on the judgment of our 
management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. The
amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors
including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and
success of preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical
trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions and
the amount of cash obtained through current and any future collaborations.

The expected net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and cash
equivalents, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our product candidates
through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to 
complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We 
expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt
financings and potential collaborations, and license and development agreements.
We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and
we could expend our available capital resources at a rate greater than we
currently expect.

Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering as described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation 
instruments, including short-term, interest-bearing obligations, 
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed 
obligations of the U.S. government."

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. These 
    loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $750,000 of
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering 
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be 
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.
 
(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of 
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the 
    completion of our initial business combination, up to $12,250,000, which 
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $14,087,500 if
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid 
    to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, 
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or 
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a 
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional 
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special 
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government 
    treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account 
    will be approximately $5,250,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5%
    per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.
 
Nasdaq rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering
and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust account.
Of the $358.5 million in gross proceeds we receive from this offering and the
sale of the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or
$412.05 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
$350 million ($10.00 per unit), or $402.5 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited
into a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as
trustee, after deducting $7 million in underwriting discounts and commissions
payable upon the closing of this offering (or $8.05 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) and an aggregate of $1.5 million to
pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and for working
capital following this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $5,250,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year;
however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. We expect that the
interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay income taxes. We
will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the
trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to fund our working capital
requirements (subject to an annual limit of $250,000) and/or to pay our taxes,
until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination,
(ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering,
subject to applicable law, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares
properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance
or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not 
consummated our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing
of this offering or with respect to any other material provisions relating to 
stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial
business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may
enter into following consummation of this offering. However, our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation provides that, following this offering and
prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be
prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders
thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with
our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an
amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (x) extend
the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months from the
closing of this offering or (y) amend the foregoing provisions.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and
administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount
not to exceed $15,000 per month in the event such space and/or services are
utilized and we do not pay a third party directly for such services. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31,
2019 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. Otherwise, such loans would be
repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up
to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post
business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the
lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.
Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to
the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek 
loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we
do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a 
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    received as loans from our insiders described below. These funds will be
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private warrants.

(3) Does not include the deferred underwriting commission payable to the
    underwriters in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised
    in the offering ($3,500,000, or $4,025,000 if the underwriter’s 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full).

(4) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including
    a deferred underwriting commission payable to the underwriters in an amount
    equal to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering described
    below.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our
    intended use of proceeds.

(6) In the event that the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the amount
    available for “working capital, as necessary” and “working capital to cover
    miscellaneous expenses” will be an aggregate of $1,205,000.

Certain of our stockholders have committed that they will purchase the private
warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000) from us on a private
placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.

$100,000,000, or $115,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds
held in the trust account will be invested only in United States government
treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S.
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax
obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption
of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business
combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete our initial business combination to the extent not used to pay
converting stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Health Sciences Holdings, LLC, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. However, pursuant to the terms of such agreement, we may
delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by our audit committee
that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay actual or
anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business combination. Any
such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later
than the date of the consummation of our initial business combination. This
arrangement is being agreed to by Health Sciences Holdings, LLC for our benefit.
We believe that the fee charged by Health Sciences Holdings, LLC is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination
or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than
the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s fees,
consulting fees or other similar compensation) will be paid to our insiders,
members of our management team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations, as well as traveling to
and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target
businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present management
after our initial business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our
initial business combination.

The net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working
capital requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $2,100,000 (or $1,800,000 if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full).

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
deferred underwriting commission payable to the underwriters in an amount equal
to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon consummation of
our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used
in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination,
the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a
business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways, including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

In December 2018, Health Sciences Holdings, LLC loaned us $300,000 to be used to
pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items
above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion
of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting fees and
expenses. The loans are payable without interest upon the consummation of this
offering.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our insiders may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds,
from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in
their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $200,000 of
the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into
additional private warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant. Our stockholders
have approved the issuance of the private warrants upon conversion of such
notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of
the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete a
business combination, any loans and advances from our insiders or their
affiliates, will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust 
account, if any.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any
tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

approximately US$29.8 million, or approximately US$34.9 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses
payable by us. These estimates are based upon an initial offering price of
US$10.50 per ADS. A US$1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public
offering price of US$10.50 per ADS would increase (decrease) the net proceeds of
this offering by US$3.2 million, or approximately US$3.7 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

  investor and borrower base;                                               

• 40% of the proceeds, or US$12.0 million, will be used to conduct strategic

  currently we have not entered into any binding agreement for any acquisition
  nor identified any definite acquisition target; and

  expenditures.                                                     

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our
business, and the present plans and business conditions. Accordingly, our
management will have significant flexibility in applying and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws
and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiary only through loans or
capital contributions, and to our VIE only through loans, and only if we satisfy
the applicable government registration and approval requirements. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements on a timely basis, if
at all.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities."

stock in this offering will be approximately $32.3 million, or approximately
$37.5 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares of common stock in full, based upon the initial public offering price of
$11.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from any sale of shares in this offering by the selling stockholder.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and
thereby enable access to the public equity markets for our employees and
stockholders and increase our visibility in the marketplace. We intend to use
the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, including
working capital, expanded sales and marketing activities, increased research and
development expenditures and funding our growth strategies. We expect to use
some of the net proceeds from this offering to satisfy anticipated tax 
withholding and remittance obligations related to the RSA Settlement in
connection with this offering. Based on approximately 384,000 RSAs that are
expected to be granted and to vest immediately prior to the closing of this
offering, and based on the initial public offering price of $11.00 per share, we
estimate that these tax withholding obligations upon the RSA Settlement would be
approximately $2.1 million in the aggregate. 

We may use a portion of the net proceeds to prepay principal amounts outstanding
and deferred accrued interest under the B. Riley Convertible Note (including a
prepayment penalty of up to 2.0% of the outstanding principal amount prepaid,
which fee is waived if the total outstanding principal amount following
prepayment does not fall below $10.0 million). The B. Riley Convertible Note has
an interest rate of 10.0% per year, matures on September 1, 2022, and had an
outstanding principal balance, including deferred accrued interest, of $13.0 
million as of December 31, 2018. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds 
to acquire or invest in complimentary businesses, although we currently have no
agreements or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions or  
investments. Pending their application, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade investments, certificates of
deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility and to create a public market for our common stock.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for general
corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and capital
expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or make
investments in businesses, products, offerings, and technologies, although we do
not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or investments
at this time.

We expect to use some of the net proceeds from this offering to satisfy a
portion of the anticipated tax withholding and remittance obligations related to
the settlement of our outstanding RSUs that will vest in connection with this
offering. Based on 76.2 million RSUs outstanding for which the service condition
has been met as of May 6, 2019, and based on the initial public offering price
of $45.00 per share, we estimate that these tax withholding obligations on the
initial settlement date would be approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this
offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many
factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our

offering. Accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of ADSs in
this offering. We will bear all costs, fees and expenses in connection with this
offering, which are estimated to be approximately $4.4 million.

In connection with the Acquisition, Highworld Investments Limited entered into a
profit sharing arrangement with an affiliate of Ivan Tavrin, and ELQ Investors
VIII Limited in turn entered into a pro rata arrangement with Highworld
Investments Limited, pursuant to which Mr. Tavrin’s affiliate will receive
approximately 9% of any profit that Highworld Investments Limited and ELQ
Investors VIII Limited realize with regard to their investment in the Company,
including any profit realized upon the sale of its ADSs in this offering.
Pursuant to this arrangement, Mr. Tavrin’s affiliate will receive approximately
$17.8 million from the sale of ADSs by the Selling Shareholders in this offering
(or approximately $20.7 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional ADSs in full). Neither Mr. Tavrin nor his affiliate provided
services in connection with the Acquisition or to the Company. Neither Mr.
Tavrin nor his affiliate is a shareholder of the Company and neither has rights
in the Company or its shares or with regard to its management. Instead, the
profit sharing arrangement with Mr. Tavrin settles the Selling Shareholders’
obligation to Mr. Tavrin arising from his relinquishing a previously existing
position as the preferred purchaser in the Acquisition. Mr. Tavrin is a
well-known Russian telecom, media and technology entrepreneur who was a founder,
shareholder and head of a number of Russian companies. He was CEO of Megafon
from 2012 to 2016. Mr. Tavrin previously held a position on the board of
directors of Mail.Ru (but did not hold such position at the time of the
Acquisition) and affiliates of Highworld Investments Limited have historically

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, establish a public market for our common shares and to
facilitate future access to the public equity markets by us, our employees and
our shareholders, obtain additional capital to support our operations and
increase our visibility in the marketplace.

As of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments of $86.0 million. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from
this offering, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, as follows:

. approximately $85.0 million for our Phase 3 clinical trials of etripamil in
  PSVT;

. approximately $20.0 million for pre-commercialization activities;

. approximately $6.0 million for our Phase 2 clinical trials of etripamil in
  atrial fibrillation and angina; and

. the remainder to fund other research and development activities, working
  capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.
However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based on our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Further, due
to the uncertainties inherent in the drug development process, it is difficult
to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this
offering that may be used for the above purposes.

Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering, and our investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. The
amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors
including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and
success of preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical
trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions and
the amount of cash obtained through current and any future collaborations.

While we anticipate that the amount of funds allocated for the Phase 3 clinical
trials of PSVT will be sufficient to complete the Phase 3 clinical trials as
currently planned, we expect that we will need to raise additional funds to
complete the regulatory approval and commercialization of etripamil for PSVT. We
also anticipate that the amount of funds allocated for the planned Phase 2
clinical trials of etripamil in atrial fibrillation and angina will be
sufficient to complete such trials. However, we expect that we will need to
raise additional capital to continue the clinical development, regulatory
approval and commercialization of etripamil in these or any other indications,
or to pursue the development and commercialization of any other product
candidates. We expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity
offerings, debt financings and potential collaborations, and license and
development agreements. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may
prove to be incorrect, and we could expend our available capital resources at a
rate greater than we currently expect.

Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering as described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation
instruments, including short-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. and Canadian governments."

announcement of the top-line results of our Phase 2/3 GAIN trial. However, the
net proceeds from this offering, together with our current cash, will not be

three months ended March 31, 2019. Based on our current plans, we believe our
cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2019, together with the net proceeds

AXA4010-001; and file an IND for a Phase IIb/III AXA1665 Clinical Trial in HE,
including if it is a registrational study. We have based these estimates on
assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available
capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In any event, we will require
additional funding to be able to complete any Clinical Trial in HE, and we do
not yet have any committed source of funding for this Clinical Trial. We may
satisfy our future cash needs through the sale of equity securities, debt
financings, working capital lines of credit, corporate collaborations or license
agreements, grant funding, interest income earned on invested cash balances, or
a combination of one or more of these sources.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds
to be received upon the completion of this offering. Due to uncertainties 
inherent in the development process, it is difficult to estimate the exact 
amounts of the net proceeds that will be used for any particular purpose. We may
use our existing cash, cash equivalents and the future payments, if any, 
generated from any future collaboration agreements to fund our operations, 
either of which may alter the amount of net proceeds used for a particular

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and thereby
enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. We
intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to fund the IPO Dividend
of $52.1 million, repay the outstanding balance of $150.5 million under our Term
Loan and repay outstanding indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility.

In January 2019, we borrowed $150.0 million under our Term Loan Agreement to
partially finance the OGSystems Acquisition. Our Term Loan is comprised of
Offshore Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Term Loan
Agreement), with an initial aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million. The
Offshore Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR, divided by 1.00
minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, plus 1.25%. The Base Rate Loans bear
interest at a rate per annum of the sum of (a) the highest of (1) the
administrative agent’s reference rate; (2) the rate equal to 1.50% per annum
above the Offshore Rate; and (3) the rate equal to 0.50% per annum above the
latest federal funds rate, plus (b) 0.25%. The Term Loan has a maturity date of
January 3, 2020. We intend to use $150.5 million of our net proceeds from this
offering to repay the outstanding balance under our Term Loan upon the
consummation of this offering.

As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding indebtedness under our Revolving Credit
Facility was $180.0 million, which does not include $110.0 million we borrowed
under our Revolving Credit Facility in January 2019 to partially finance the
OGSystems Acquisition. In May 2018, we borrowed $260.0 million under our
Revolving Credit Facility to partially finance the acquisition of Polaris Alpha.
Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, borrowings under our Revolving Credit
Facility bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate (as defined in
the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin, or LIBOR plus an applicable
margin. The applicable margin for Base Rate loans is a range of 0.125% to 1.00%
and the applicable margin for LIBOR loans is a range of 1.125% to 2.00%, both
based on our leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Credit
Agreement has a maturity date of November 15, 2022.

We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this
offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the
use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to invest the net
proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term and long-term
interest-bearing obligations, including government- and investment-grade debt
securities and money market funds.

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $275,000,000 (or $316,250,000
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full).
 
(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsors of up to an aggregate of $300,000 as described in this 
    prospectus. As of February 28, 2019, we had not borrowed any amounts (of up
    to $300,000 available to us) under the promissory notes with our sponsors to
    be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These amounts will 
    be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the offering proceeds that
    has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than 
    underwriting commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than
    as set forth in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the 
    $1,500,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside
    for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering 
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will
    be used for post-closing working capital expenses.
 
(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial 
    business combination, $9,625,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s 
    deferred commissions (or $11,068,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The 
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and 
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for 
    our expenses.
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.
 
Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $275,000,000 (or $316,250,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $9,625,000 (or $11,068,750 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only
in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $6,215,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 2.26% per year; however, we can provide no assurance
regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, the
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will
not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the
completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public
shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our
third amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance
or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering or to provide for redemption in connection with a business
combination, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our
initial business combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of
a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If
our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or
not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the
consideration in connection with our initial business combination, we may use
the balance of the cash released from the trust account following the closing
for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of
operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest
due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to
fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no
limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked
securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with
our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase
agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of
this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsors, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay FEI a total of 
$10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation,
we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsors have agreed to loan us up to
an aggregate of $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this
offering. As of February 28, 2019, we had not borrowed any amounts under the
promissory notes with our sponsors to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at
the earlier of September 30, 2019 or the closing of this offering. The loan will
be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of offering proceeds not held in
the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsors or an affiliate of one of
our sponsors or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsors or an affiliate
of one of our sponsors as we do not believe third parties will be willing to
loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access
to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsors, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately-negotiated transactions or in the open market, either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There
is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors,
officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions,
subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have
no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and
have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they
engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are
in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller
or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We
do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a
tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination. 

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of deferred underwriters’ commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible 
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our third amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or to provide for
redemption in connection with a business combination and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination
within 24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable
law and as further described herein and any limitations (including, but not
limited to, cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsors, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsors or any of our officers,
directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they
will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business
combination within the prescribed time frame."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $48.7 million, or
$56.3 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 825,000
additional shares in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We also expect to
receive net proceeds of approximately $14.0 million from the sale of shares of
our common stock to New Enterprise Associates, or NEA, in the concurrent private
placement, after deducting placement agent fees payable by us, for aggregate net
proceeds to be raised by us in this offering and the concurrent private
placement of $62.6 million.

As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.2 million. We
currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows: 

• approximately $7.5 million to $13.5 million to fund the development of 
  nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis;

• approximately $5.0 million to $7.5 million to fund the development of 
  nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with chronic liver
  disease; 

• approximately $4.0 million to $8.0 million to fund the development of 
  nalbuphine ER for the treatment of chronic cough in patients with IPF; 

• approximately $5.5 million to $7.5 million to fund the development of
  nalbuphine ER for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson’s disease;
  and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from the concurrent
private placement as follows: 

• approximately $2.5 to $4.0 million to fund the development of nalbuphine ER 
  for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis; 

• approximately $1.0 to $1.5 million to fund the development of nalbuphine ER 
  for the treatment of pruritus associated with chronic liver disease; 

• approximately $1.0 to $2.0 million to fund the development of nalbuphine ER 
  for the treatment of chronic cough in patients with IPF;

• approximately $1.5 to $2.5 million to fund the development of nalbuphine ER 
  for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson’s disease; and 

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and the net proceeds
from the concurrent private placement and our existing cash and cash equivalents
represents our intentions based on our current plans and business conditions,
which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our clinical
development of nalbuphine ER, the status of and results from our clinical
trials, including our ongoing PRISM trial as well as the additional Phase 3
clinical trial we will need to conduct for nalbuphine ER for pruritus associated
with prurigo nodularis, the timing of regulatory submissions and the outcome of
regulatory review, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with
third parties and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, we cannot predict with
certainty the expenditures that may be necessary to complete the clinical
development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER for any indication and our
management will retain broad discretion over the application of the net proceeds
from this offering and the net proceeds from the concurrent private placement.

Based on our current plans, we believe that the anticipated net proceeds from
this offering and the net proceeds from the concurrent private placement,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our
operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the end of 2020.
In particular, we expect that the anticipated net proceeds from this offering
and the net proceeds from the concurrent private placement, together with our
existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to complete our ongoing PRISM
trial, our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with chronic liver
disease, our planned Phase 2 clinical trial for chronic cough in patients with
IPF and our planned Phase 2 clinical trial for LID in patients with Parkinson’s
disease. However, we do not expect these funds will be sufficient to complete
the clinical development of nalbuphine ER for pruritus associated with prurigo
nodularis and other indications, commercialize nalbuphine ER (if we receive
regulatory approval) for pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis and other
indications, and pursue the development and commercialization of any future
product candidate. We do not have any committed external source of funds.
Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or
private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing
arrangements or other sources to complete the clinical development and
commercialization of nalbuphine ER for pruritus associated with prurigo
nodularis or any other indication.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering and the net proceeds from
the concurrent private placement, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a
variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearinginstruments and U.S. government securities."

approximately US$107.7 million, or approximately US$124.6 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering to expand our business operations as
follows:

• approximately 30% to enhance and expand our business operations;

• approximately 35% to enhance our technological capabilities, including our
  technology infrastructure;                                                

• approximately 25% to expand and improve our fulfillment facilities; and

• the balance for general corporate purposes, which may include funding working
  capital needs and potential strategic investments and acquisitions, although 
  we have not identified any specific investments or acquisition opportunities 
  at this time.                                   

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus. 

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our VIEs only
through loans, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and
approval requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, or at all."

deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us
will be approximately $23.0 million, or approximately $26.8 million if the
underwriters elect to exercise in full the overallotment option. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling
shareholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for general corporate
purposes and investment in our bank subsidiary, which may include the support of
our balance sheet growth, repayment of our junior subordinated debentures (the
terms of which are included in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”), the acquisition of
other banks or financial institutions to the extent such opportunities arise,
and the maintenance of our capital and liquidity ratios, and the ratios of our
bank, at acceptable levels.

We have not specifically allocated the amount of net proceeds to us that will be
used for these purposes and our management will have broad discretion over how
these proceeds are used. We are conducting this offering at this time because we
believe that it will allow us to better execute our growth strategy. Although we
may, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, evaluate potential
acquisition opportunities that we believe provide attractive risk-adjusted
returns, we do not have any immediate plans, arrangements, or understandings
relating to any acquisitions, nor are we engaged in negotiations with any
potential acquisition targets."

after deducting the underwriting discount.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to purchase LLC Interests 
from SG Holding I and SciPlay Parent LLC, at a purchase price per interest equal
to the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock less the
underwriting discount, as follows:

• $255.0 million to purchase LLC Interests from SG Holding I, which amount will
  be used by SG Holding I to make the Upfront License Payment required under the
  IP License Agreement;

• $10.0 million to purchase LLC Interests from SciPlay Parent LLC, which amount
  will be used by SciPlay Parent LLC to pay fees and expenses in connection with
  the Transactions, including this offering;

• $20.0 million to purchase LLC Interests from SciPlay Parent LLC, which amount
  will be used by SciPlay Parent LLC for general corporate purposes, including 
  to pay a portion of contingent acquisition consideration that may become 
  payable as a result of this offering; and

• $45.9 million to purchase LLC interests from SG Holding I.

We will not have any ability to control how SG Holding I uses any such amounts
in excess of the amount received to make the Upfront License Payment.

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class
A common stock in full, our additional net proceeds will be approximately 
$49.6 million, after deducting the corresponding underwriting discount. We will
use the additional net proceeds we receive pursuant to any exercise of the 
underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock to 
purchase additional LLC Interests from SG Holding I to maintain the one-to-one 
ratio between the number of shares of Class A common stock issued by us and the
number of LLC Interests owned by us.

that is 5% or more of the net proceeds of this offering due to the repayment of
borrowings thereunder. Additionally, if any of the underwriters or their
affiliates hold notes issued by Scientific Games International, Inc., they may
receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering if any portion of the

The principal purpose of this offering is to provide us with funds to develop
our business. The net proceeds from this offering will be used for working
capital and other general corporate purposes, including marketing, hiring
additional employees, enhancing our information technology systems. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,

of the net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your
investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used
appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not
increase our operating results or the market value of our Ordinary Shares. In

As an offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations

make loans or capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary without first
obtaining regulatory approvals, and if we decide to use the proceeds from this

these regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. However, we do not plan
to use the proceeds from this offering to provide funding to WFOE or to our VIE

generally be accomplished without transferring funds into the PRC, such as (1) 
opening new branch offices and conducting R&D and recruitment in Hong Kong and 
other Asian countries, (2) conducting marketing and promotional activities in 
the aforementioned territories, (3) conducting mergers and acquisitions abroad 
or using offshore investment structures. Moreover, we believe the current cash 
reserves held by WFOE and our VIE, combined with the cash generated from their 
operating activities, will be sufficient for our operating and expansion needs 
within the PRC over the foreseeable future. 

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not

The principal purpose of this offering is to provide us with funds to develop
our business. The net proceeds from this offering will be used for working
capital and other general corporate purposes, including marketing, hiring
additional employees, enhancing our information technology systems. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,
technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business, although we
have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or
investments. Our management will have considerable discretion in the application
of the net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your
investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used
appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not
increase our operating results or the market value of our Ordinary Shares. In
view of the foregoing, in purchasing Ordinary Shares, you will be entrusting
your funds to our management with little specific information as to how the
proceeds will be utilized. Our management, however, will have significant
flexibility and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an
unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds
of this offering differently than as described in this prospectus.

As an offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations
to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries through loans or capital
contributions, subject to applicable regulatory approvals. We currently cannot
make loans or capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary without first
obtaining regulatory approvals, and if we decide to use the proceeds from this
offering within the PRC, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
these regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. However, we do not plan
to use the proceeds from this offering to provide funding to WFOE or to our VIE
through loans or capital contributions, and the uses specified above can 
generally be accomplished without transferring funds into the PRC, such as (1) 
opening new branch offices and conducting R&D and recruitment in Hong Kong and 
other Asian countries, (2) conducting marketing and promotional activities in 
the aforementioned territories, (3) conducting mergers and acquisitions abroad 
or using offshore investment structures. Moreover, we believe the current cash 
reserves held by WFOE and our VIE, combined with the cash generated from their 
operating activities, will be sufficient for our operating and expansion needs 
within the PRC over the foreseeable future. 

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not 
immediately used for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing bank deposits or debt instruments."

  sales and marketing capabilities; and

• Any proceeds not applied to the foregoing will be used for working capital

A portion of our net proceeds may also be used to fund potential acquisitions

approximately US$162.9 million, or approximately US$187.9 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately 30% to invest in technology and research and development;

• approximately 20% for horizontal and vertical business expansions;

• approximately 10% to enhance our content offering; and

the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares
from us in this offering, based on the initial public offering price of $16.00
per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $25.0 million to support commercialization of the OCS Lung and,
  if approved, the OCS Heart in the United States;                     

• approximately $20.0 million to fund research and development to design and
  manufacture the next generation of OCS technology;

• the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

In addition, we believe that opportunities may exist from time to time to expand
our current business through acquisitions of or investments in complementary
products, technologies or businesses. While we have no current agreements,
commitments or understandings for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at
this time, we may use a portion of our net proceeds for these purposes.

Based on our current plans, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our
operating expenses, including completing the clinical trials specifically
identified above, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for
at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may
prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner
than we expect.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
we receive from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of
our management regarding the application of our net proceeds. The timing and
amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash
flows from operations, the occurrence and timing of regulatory approvals and
clinical trials, the anticipated growth of our business and the availability and
terms of alternative financing sources to fund our growth. Pending their use as
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds we receive from this
offering in saving, certificate of deposit and money market accounts as well as
short-term and intermediate investment-grade interest-bearing securities and
obligations, such as money market funds, commercial paper and obligations of the
United States government and its agencies."

836,718 additional shares, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering
will be approximately $93.2 million, after deducting estimated underwriting

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as
follows:

• approximately $55.0 million to fund the completion of our ongoing Phase 2 
  clinical trial and completion of a planned Phase 3 clinical trial for the 
  treatment of psychosis in schizophrenia;                                  

• approximately $24.0 million to fund the completion of our planned Phase 1b

  treatment of psychosis in AD;

• approximately $5.0 million to further develop and expand our pipeline,    
  including other muscarinic candidates, formulations and derivatives; and  

• the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate activities.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering along with our existing
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. For example, we may use a
portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses or technologies to
continue to build our pipeline, our research and development capabilities and
our intellectual property position, although we currently have no agreements,
commitments or understandings with respect to any such transaction. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on
numerous factors, including the progress of our development and
commercialization efforts, the status of and results from clinical trials, any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. Moreover, our estimates of the costs
to fund our trials are based on the current designs of the trials. If we were to
modify the design of any of these trials, for instance, to increase the number
of patients in the trials, our costs to fund the trials could increase. As a
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments, together with the net proceeds from this offering,
will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements for at least the next 18 months. We have based this
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not have any
committed external source of funds.

The expected use of the net proceeds from the offering represents our intentions

current intentions and will depend on a number of factors, including the success
of research and product development efforts, cash generated from future
operations and actual expenses to operate our business. We may use a portion of
the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, businesses that
complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements.

The amounts and timing of our preclinical and clinical expenditures and the
extent of preclinical and clinical development may vary significantly depending
on numerous factors, including the status, results and timing of our current
preclinical studies and the preclinical studies and clinical trials which we may
commence in the future, the product approval process with the FDA and other
regulatory agencies, our current collaborations and any new collaborations we
may enter into with third parties and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, we

net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering.

any of our product candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need to
raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and
commercialization of our product candidates.

offering in short term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as
money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, obtain additional capital to support our operations, create a
public market for our common stock and to facilitate our potential future access
to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering as follows:

our anticipated growth, for working capital and for other general corporate
purposes.

We currently believe the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to
develop clonoSEQ for CLL and NHL through FDA authorization and reimbursement,
immunoSEQ Dx for a selected indication into clinical validation, and one of our
TCR-based cell therapies through IND submission. We believe our cash flows from
operations and our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,
together with the net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund

The estimated use of proceeds is preliminary and subject to change. We cannot
specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be
received upon the closing of this offering. Due to uncertainties inherent in the
development process, it is difficult to estimate the exact amounts of the net

cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and the future payments, if any,
generated from any future collaboration agreements to fund our operations,
either of which may alter the amount of net proceeds used for a particular
purpose. In addition, the amount, allocation and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our
research and development efforts, the timing and success of our Genentech and
Microsoft collaborations and the timing of regulatory submissions. Accordingly,
we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 as described in this
    prospectus. As of June 7, 2019, there was $150,000 outstanding under such
    promissory note. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering
    out of the $1.000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held
    in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as
    set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing
    working capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more
    than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held
    in the trust account.
 
(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $21,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $24,150,000 if the underwriters’ option to
    purchase additional units is exercised in full) will be paid to the
    underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed
    estimates.
 
(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect the trust account
    to generate approximately $9,000,000 of interest annually; however, we can
    provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an 
    interest rate of 1.5% per annum based upon current yields of securities in
    which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance
    transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
    combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and
    directors may, but none of them is obligated to, loan us funds as may be
    required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
    In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may
    use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay
    such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to
    repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible
    into warrants at a price of  $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.
    The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to
    our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and
    no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to
    seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
    or our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties
    will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all
    rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 
 
(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.
 
(7) Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding.

The rules of NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $600,000,000 (or $690,000,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $21,000,000 (or
$24,150,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering,
be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The funds in the
trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds that meet certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that
invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. Based on current interest
rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $9,000,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year.
We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in
the trust account, except with respect to permitted withdrawals. The funds held
in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination; (2) the
redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the
completion window; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion
window, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we expect
that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply
the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of
post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their respective affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation or
other duty to loan funds to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 under an unsecured promissory note to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. As of June 7, 2019, there was $150,000 outstanding
under such promissory note. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and
are due at the earlier of December 31, 2019 and the closing of this offering.
These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the
$1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of
offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
or our officers and directors may, but none of them is obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account
released to us. In the event that our initial business combination does not
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account
would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may
be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of
the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants
issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of
our sponsor or our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and
no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek
loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our
officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their respective affiliates may also purchase shares in privately
negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the
completion of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any
such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions,
they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny
stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require
as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of
cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that
we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business
combination and then, only in connection with those public shares that such
stockholder has properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
in this prospectus; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted
in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial
business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within the completion window; and (3)
the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
initial business combination within the completion window, subject to applicable
law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or
interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to (1) waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination and (2) waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by
them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in
connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination within the
completion window. In addition, our initial stockholders, officers and directors
have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the completion window. However, if our
sponsor or any of our officers or directors acquires public shares in or after
this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the completion window."

Change Healthcare Inc. for all of the expenses payable by it in this offering.
We estimate these offering expenses (excluding underwriting discounts and

We estimate that the net proceeds to Change Healthcare Inc. from the concurrent

Change Healthcare Inc. intends to use all of the net proceeds from this offering
(including from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase

Units from the Joint Venture that is equivalent to the number of shares of
common stock that we offer and sell in this offering. Change Healthcare Inc.
intends to invest an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the Units
in the concurrent offering of the Units (including from any exercise by the
underwriters in the concurrent offering of the Units of their option to purchase
additional Units) in the Joint Venture. The Joint Venture, in turn, will enter
into the Mirror Arrangements with Change Healthcare Inc. on economic terms
designed to materially mirror those of the Units. The Joint Venture, in turn,
expects to use the proceeds from (i) this offering, together with cash on hand,
to repay outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured term loan facility
totaling approximately $529 million in aggregate principal amount (or $609
million in aggregate principal amount if the underwriters exercise in full their
option to purchase additional shares of common stock) at the initial public
offering price of $13.00 per share and (ii) the concurrent offering of the
Units, if completed, together with cash on hand, to repay outstanding
indebtedness under our senior secured term loan facility totaling approximately
$243 million in aggregate principal amount (or $279 million in aggregate
principal amount if the underwriters in the concurrent offering of the Units
exercise in full their option to purchase additional Units), and for offering
expenses. The Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility provided for by
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature on March 1, 2024 and March 1, 2022,
respectively. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear
interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) LIBOR for the relevant
interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements (which may be
subject, solely in the case of the Term Loan Facility, to a floor of 1.00% per
annum and, solely in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, to a floor of
0.00% per annum), plus an applicable margin or (ii) a base rate equal to the
highest of (a) the rate of interest in effect as publicly announced by the
administrative agent as its prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate
plus 0.50% and (c) adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%
(which may be subject, solely in the case of the Term Loan Facility, to a floor
of 2.00% per annum), in each case, plus an applicable margin. The net proceeds
from borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities were used, together
with the net proceeds of the Senior Notes, to refinance certain existing
indebtedness of Legacy CHC and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Transactions."

selling in this offering will be approximately $62.9 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses and assuming no
payment of underwriting discounts and commissions on the sale of all 1,500,000
ordinary shares in this offering that Vector Capital, through affiliated
entities, will purchase, as described elsewhere in this prospectus. If the
underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares in this
offering, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $72.6 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares, facilitate access to the public equity markets, increase our visibility
in the marketplace and obtain additional capital.

We will use $30.7 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay down our
credit facility and $5.6 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay
management fees to VCH, L.P. and its affiliates, based on the amount accrued as
of March 31, 2019. Aside from these payments, we will have no future obligations
to return capital or pay management fees to VCH, L.P., Vector Capital or any of
its affiliated entities after this offering.

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for
working capital and general corporate purposes. In addition, we believe that
opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current business through
acquisitions of or investments in complementary products, technologies or
businesses. While we have no agreements, commitments or understandings for any
specific acquisitions at this time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering for these purposes.

Aside from the uses set forth above, our management will have broad discretion
in the application of the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net
proceeds. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many
factors, including cash flows from operations, the anticipated growth of our
business, and the availability and terms of alternative financing sources to
fund our growth. Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend
to invest the proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government. The goal with respect to the investment of
these net proceeds will be capital preservation and liquidity so that these
funds are readily available to fund our operations."

We will have broad discretion in allocating the net proceeds from this offering.
With respect to the financing of our acquisition strategy, we constantly analyze
market acquisition opportunities as they arise and are currently analyzing such
opportunities in the ordinary course of our business. As of the date of this
prospectus, no such opportunity has progressed to advanced discussions or has 
otherwise reached a level in negotiations such that we would deem the 
acquisition to be probable.

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this 
offering as described above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of
funds is necessary. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will 
depend upon numerous factors. An investor will not have the opportunity to 
evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we base our 
decisions on how to use the proceeds.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, interest-bearing instruments and Brazilian and U.S. government
securities.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $45 million to fund the development of ATRC-101 through the
  dose-escalation portion of our Phase 1b clinical trial and a portion of our

and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2019, as follows:

• approximately $65 million to complete our ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial and
  a subsequent Phase 2b clinical trial of our lead product candidate, AKR-001,
  in patients with NASH;

• approximately $35 million for new AKR-001 drug substance and drug product

in products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our business.
However, we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such
transaction.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds
to be received upon the completion of this offering. Due to uncertainties
inherent in the product development process, it is difficult to estimate the
exact amounts of the net proceeds that will be used for any particular purpose.
We may use our existing cash and cash equivalents and the future payments, if
any, generated from any future collaboration agreements to fund our operations,
either of which may alter the amount of net proceeds used for a particular
purpose. In addition, the amount, allocation and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our
research and development efforts, the timing and success of clinical trials and
the timing of regulatory submissions. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion
in using these proceeds.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million to advance the development of

  treatment of PD-GBA and neuronopathic Gaucher disease;

  treatment of FTD-GRN; and

  treatment of synucleinopathies.                                           

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least
through the first half of 2021, and through initial expected data release from
our Phase 1/2 clinical trials for PR001 for the treatment of PD-GBA and Type 2
Gaucher disease, the initiation of our anticipated Phase 1/2 clinical trials for
PR001 for the treatment of Type 3 Gaucher disease and PR006 for the treatment of
FTD-GRN and the completion of our IND-enabling studies for PR004 for the
treatment of synucleinopathies. We have based this estimate on assumptions that
may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner
than we expect. The expected net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash and cash equivalents, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of
our drug candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise
additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our drug
candidates.

This expected use of existing cash and cash equivalents and our net proceeds
from this offering represent our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. Predicting the costs necessary to develop product candidates
can be difficult and we will need additional funds to complete our clinical
development of any of our product candidates. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of those net proceeds. The timing and
amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash
flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business. Pending these
uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their    
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
    combination.                                                                 

(2) Includes 2,227,500 units that a fund managed by an affiliate of our sponsor  
    has expressed an intent to purchase at the public offering price. The        
    underwriter will not receive any underwriting discount or commissions on     
    units purchased by such fund.                                                

(3) Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 as described in this        
    prospectus. As of April 19, 2019, there were no amounts outstanding under    
    such promissory note. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this     
    offering out of the $900,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated 
    for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions)
    not held in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less
    than as set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for 
    post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the offering 
    expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess
    with funds not held in the trust account. 

(4) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial 
    business combination, $7,095,375, which constitutes the underwriter’s 
    deferred commissions (or up to $8,276,625 if the underwriter’s option to 
    purchase additional units is exercised in full) will be paid to the 
    underwriter from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining 
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, 
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or 
    for working capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. 

(5) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts  
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed 
    estimates.

(6) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in 
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust     
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect the trust account  
    to generate approximately $3,375,000 of interest annually; however, we can   
    provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an        
    interest rate of 1.5% per annum based upon current yields of securities in   
    which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance    
    transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business            
    combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and    
    directors may, but none of them is obligated to, loan us funds as may be     
    required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay    
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. 
    In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use
    a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
    loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay 
    such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into  
    warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The    
    warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our  
    sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no    
    written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek
    loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our
    officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be   
    willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
    seek access to funds in our trust account.                                   

(7) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment    
    fees for financing.                                                          

(8) Does not include the fees to be reimbursed to the Company under the          
    Administrative Services Agreement.                                           

Nasdaq rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering
and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust account.
Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $225,000,000 (or $258,750,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $7,095,375 (or $8,276,625 if the
underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering, be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account at Citibank N.A. with Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The funds in the trust account will
be invested only pursuant to the immediate investment strategy. Based on current
interest rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will
be approximately $3,375,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per
year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held
in the trust account, except with respect to permitted withdrawals. The funds
held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination; (2) the
redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the
completion window; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion
window, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we expect
that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply
the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of
post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on 
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund 
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their respective affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation or
other duty to loan funds to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $25,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 under an unsecured promissory note to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. As of April 19, 2019, there were no amounts
outstanding under such promissory note. These loans are non-interest bearing,
unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2019 and the closing of
this offering. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
of the $900,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of
offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
or our officers and directors may, but none of them is obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account
released to us. In the event that our initial business combination does not
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account
would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may
be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of
the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants
issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of
our sponsor or our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and
no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek
loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our
officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their respective affiliates may also purchase shares in privately
negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the
completion of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any
such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans 
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, 
they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in 
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do 
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a 
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.
                       
We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net 
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny
stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require
as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of
cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that
we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business
combination and then, only in connection with those public shares that such
stockholder has properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
in this prospectus; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted
in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to (i) modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with
an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do
not complete our initial business combination within the completion window or
(ii) with respect to any provisions relating to the rights of holders of our
Class A common stock; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we
are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion
window, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter
agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to (1) waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held
by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination
and (2) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and
public shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an
amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the
substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our
public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem
100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our initial business
combination within the completion window. In addition, our initial stockholders,
officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
completion window. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers or directors
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
completion window."

stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share,
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses, will be approximately $129.6 million. If the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, then the net
proceeds will be approximately $149.5 million.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as
follows:

• approximately $36.0 million to $39.0 million to advance our lead product
  candidate, STK-001, through initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial;

• approximately $34.0 million to $37.0 million to nominate, conduct preclinical
  studies for and demonstrate clinical proof of concept for additional product
  candidates; and

• any remaining amounts to fund working capital and general corporate purposes.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds, we estimate such funds, together
with our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, will be sufficient
for us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
through the end of 2022.

The expected use of the net proceeds from the offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts we actually
expend in these areas, and the timing thereof, may vary significantly from our
current intentions and will depend on a number of factors, including the success
of research and product development efforts, cash generated from future
operations and actual expenses to operate our business. We may use a portion of
the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, businesses that
complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements.

The amounts and timing of our clinical expenditures and the extent of clinical
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
status, results and timing of our current preclinical studies and those clinical
trials which we may commence in the future, the product approval process with
the FDA and other regulatory agencies, our current collaborations and any new
collaborations we may enter into with third parties and any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, we cannot predict with any certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses
set forth above. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this
offering.

The expected net proceeds of this offering will not be sufficient for us to fund
any of our product candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need to
raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and
commercialization of our product candidates.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as
money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."

the particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering.
Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their    
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of a loan  
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. This     
    amount will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in
    the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. If the underwriter’s over-allotment   
    option is exercised, 5.5% of the gross proceeds from the over-allotment      
    ($0.55 per unit or up to $2,887,500 in the aggregate) will be deposited in   
    the trust account as deferred underwriting commissions. Upon completion of   
    our initial business combination, $12,250,000, which constitutes the         
    underwriter’s deferred commissions (or $15,137,500 if the underwriter’s      
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter  
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less      
    amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be       
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price 
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination    
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or  
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business    
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital.
    The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred 
    underwriting discounts and commissions.                                    

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
    financing.

We may increase or decrease the total number of units sold to the public in this
offering. If we decide to proceed with an offering that results in an increase
in the total number of units sold to the public, we would have additional
proceeds from the offering available to pursue an acquisition. If we proceed
with an offering that results in a decrease in the total number of shares sold
to the public, we would have reduced proceeds from the offering available to
pursue an acquisition. Such an increase or decrease may impact the size of the
initial business combination we may pursue. In addition, the proceeds held in
trust would correspondingly increase or decrease such that 100% of the gross
proceeds from this offering will be held in trust. The underwriter’s option to
purchase additional units to cover over-allotments and the amount of private
placement warrants that our sponsor will purchase will correspondingly increase
or decrease. We would issue additional Class B common stock in the event we
increase the total number of units sold in this offering and the holders of our
Class B common stock would forfeit shares of Class B common stock in the event
we decrease the total number of units sold in this offering so that the number
of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of
Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20%
of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon
completion of this offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and
equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business
combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be
issued, to any seller in the business combination).

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $350,000,000 (or $402,500,000 if the underwriter’s
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $12,250,000 (or
$15,137,500 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills 
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain 
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest 
earned on the trust account will be approximately $4,900,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 1.4% per year; however, we can provide no assurance 
regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, the
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will
not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the
completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public
shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering or (ii) with respect to any other provisions relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (c) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay our sponsor a
total of $20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and
administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is
due at the earlier of December 31, 2019 or the closing of this offering. The
loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the offering
proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds (at a nominal interest rate) as may be required. If we complete
our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the
proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be
repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up
to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of
$1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical
to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price,
exercisability and exercise period. Other than as described above, the terms of
such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and
no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion
of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties
other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or
their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with
applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ.

However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going- private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net
tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon
completion of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to
the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination
may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described in this prospectus, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly
submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, and
(iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
business combination within 24 months following the closing of this offering,
subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations
(including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the
proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination and to waive their
redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in
connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering
or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or
pre-initial business combination activity. In addition, our initial stockholders
have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete
our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our
sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares
in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame."

$45.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
to be received by us will be approximately $53.3 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. We
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common
stock by the selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock and improve our
brand awareness. We intend to use $40.8 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to repurchase an aggregate of 2,400,960 shares of Class B common stock
from TSG and Capretto. We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from
this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which we
currently expect will include continued investment to support our growth,
increased investment in owned brands, as well as overall growth in our
international operations. However, we do not currently have specific planned
uses for the proceeds. We may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire
or invest in complementary brands or businesses; however, we currently have no
agreements or commitments to complete any such transactions.

Because we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital
and other general corporate purposes, our management will have broad discretion
over the use of the net proceeds from this offering. As of the date of this
prospectus, we intend to invest the net proceeds that are not used as described
above in capital-preservation investments, including short-term interest-bearing
investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit or U.S. government backed
securities."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised, the underwriting
    discount applicable to each unit sold pursuant to the over-allotment option
    will be approximately $0.20. No discounts or commissions will be paid with
    respect to the purchase of the private units.

(3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth in this prospectus.
    For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our 
    current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which    
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust  
    account.                                                                

(4) The funds from the promissory note issued to our Sponsor for $99,937 as of
    June 5, 2019, will be used to prepay certain expenses related to the  
    offering. Upon receipt of the funds from the offering, we will use funds 
    allocated for these offering expenses to repay the promissory note in full.

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private units be deposited in a trust account. Of
the gross proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, a total
of $150,000,000 (or $172,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), will be placed in a trust account with JP Morgan Chase Bank,
N.A., in the United States in New York, New York, maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in
U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity of 185 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except
for (A) all interest income that may be released to us to pay taxes, and (B) up
to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses, as discussed below, none of the funds
held in the trust account will be released from the trust account until the
earlier of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination within the
required time period; (2) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public
shares if we have not completed an initial business combination in the required
time period; and (3) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within the required time period or (B) with respect to any other
provision relating to our pre-business combination activity and related
stockholders’ rights.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our Sponsor or an affiliate of
our Sponsor or our executive officers and directors, but such members of our
management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in,
us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the NYSE, we have
agreed to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for
office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our Sponsor, executive officers,
directors, or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as
may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we would
repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held outside the
trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into additional units of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units
would be identical to the private units. The terms of such loans by our officers
and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist
with respect to such loans.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be
further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination.
If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of Common Stock that
such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of
this offering, or, if our charter documents are amended to so provide, (iii) the
redemption of our public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to amend
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the
closing of this offering, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, subject to applicable
law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or
interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our Founders and underwriters have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares, insider shares, private shares and shares
underlying any warrants included in the private units, and private underwriter
shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination.
Our Founders have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to
any public shares purchased during or after this offering in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination. In addition, our Founders,
underwriters and Ms. McDonough have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions with respect to their founder shares, insider shares, private
shares and private underwriter shares if we fail to consummate our initial
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering.
However, if our Founders, underwriters or Ms. McDonough acquire public shares in
or after this offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating
distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our
initial business combination within the required time period."
