of common stock in this offering will be approximately $48.3 million, or
approximately $55.9 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, based on the initial public offering price
of $11.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as
follows:

  •   approximately $44.0 million to conduct our planned Phase 3 clinical trials   
      and other development activities for I.V. CR845;                             

  •   approximately $2.1 million to conduct our planned Phase 1 clinical trial for 
      Oral CR845;                                                                  

  •   approximately $2.2 million to conduct our planned Phase 2a clinical trials   
      and other development activities for Oral CR845; and                         

  •   the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

These expected uses represent our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any new
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds from this
offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many
factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our
business. Pending these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United
States. The goal with respect to the investment of these net proceeds is capital
preservation and liquidity so that such funds are readily available to fund our
operations."

million (or approximately $88.7 million if the underwriters fully exercise their
option to purchase additional shares of our common stock from us), after
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by
us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, excluding any net proceeds
received from any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares from us, primarily for the acquisition of land, and for development of 
lots, home construction and other related purposes. We do not intend to use any 
of the net proceeds from this offering to purchase of any real estate 
inventories from any of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or 
more than 5% stockholders.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in a
variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
interest-bearing investment grade securities, money market accounts, 
certificates of deposit and direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government.

Although we will receive the net proceeds from any sale of shares of our common
stock pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from
us, we will use such proceeds to purchase an equivalent number of shares of our
common stock from Watt, one of our non-management institutional investors."

stock in this offering will be approximately $109.5 million at an initial public
offering price of $21.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that
the net proceeds will be approximately $126.4 million after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. As of September 30, 2013, we had cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $63.7 million. We intend
to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with our existing cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, as follows:

.  Approximately $9 million to advance our ongoing clinical program for KRN23, 
   net of cost-share reimbursement from our partner KHK;

.  Approximately $23 million to advance our ongoing clinical program for rhGUS;

.  Approximately $41 million to advance our ongoing clinical program for     
   triheptanoin in both LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS;                                

.  Approximately $15 million to advance our ongoing clinical program for SA-ER;

.  Approximately $4.3 million as a cash dividend to the holders of our preferred
   stock payable upon conversion of the preferred stock to common stock; and

.  Although we have no plans to allocate specific amounts as of the date of  
   this prospectus, the remainder for preclinical research, our ongoing clinical
   programs as described above, working capital, and other general corporate 
   purposes.      

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above.
We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire, or invest
in additional businesses, technologies, products, or assets. Although we have no
specific agreements, commitments, or understandings with respect to any
in-license or acquisition, we evaluate such opportunities and engage in related
discussions with other companies from time to time. Due to the many variables
inherent to the development of our product candidates, we cannot currently
predict the stage of development we expect the net proceeds of this offering to
achieve for our clinical studies and product candidates.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the results of our research and development efforts, the
timing and success of preclinical studies, our ongoing clinical studies or
clinical studies we may commence in the future and the timing of regulatory
submissions. As a result, our management will have broad discretion over the use
of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit, or government securities."

in this offering will be $87.8 million (or $99.5 million if the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A Common
Stock from us and the selling stockholders), after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions of $6.6 million.

We intend to use $69.8 million of the net proceeds from this offering to
purchase newly-issued LLC Units from the LLC, and we will cause the LLC to use
these proceeds (1) to pay down all of the amounts owed on our credit facilities
and term loans in an amount equal to $63.4 million, (2) to pay Malibu Boats
Investor, LLC, an affiliate, a fee of $3.75 million upon the consummation of
this offering in connection with the termination of our management agreement 
and (3) for other general corporate purposes. On July 16, 2013, we entered into 
a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by SunTrust Bank
that includes a revolving credit facility, swingline credit facility, letter of
credit facility and term loans. The proceeds from the credit agreement, in
conjunction with cash on the balance sheet, were used to repay our then-existing
term and revolving loans, pay equity distributions of $53.8 million and deferred
financing and related fees of $1.0 million. As of September 30, 2013, we had an
aggregate total of $64.2 million outstanding under the term loans and the
applicable rate for the term loans was 3.19%. The maturity date of the term
loans is July 16, 2018. SunTrust Bank, an affiliate of one of the underwriters,
will receive more than 5% of the proceeds from this offering. Accordingly, this
offering is being made in compliance with FINRA Rule 5121. 

We intend to use all of the remaining net proceeds from this offering, or $18.1
million (or $29.8 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase additional shares of Class A Common Stock from us and the selling
stockholders), to purchase LLC Units from our existing owners at a purchase
price per unit equal to the initial public offering price per share of Class A
Common Stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions. We will only purchase LLC Units from our employees and members of 
senior management, however, if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option to purchase additional shares of Class A Common Stock. If the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, whether in part or in full, 
we will purchase a number of LLC Units from our employees and members of senior
management so that they will have sold units in the offering on a pro rata 
basis with all other existing owners of LLC Units. We will not retain any of 
the proceeds used to purchase LLC Units from our existing owners.

Management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the
offering. The amount and timing of our actual spending for these purposes may
vary significantly from our plans and will depend on a number of factors,
including our future revenue, cash generated by operations and other factors.
We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds for 
other purposes. 

The selling stockholders may offer up to 399,114 shares of Class A Common Stock
in the offering (or 571,289 shares of Class A Common Stock if the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A Common
Stock from us and the selling stockholders). We will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. We will, however, bear the
costs, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with the
sale of shares by the selling stockholders."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $57.7 million,
or approximately $66.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of September 30, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $48.0 million.
We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $27.0 million to fund the costs of a Phase 2b clinical trial 
  for TRV027; 

• approximately $41.0 million to fund TRV130 through Phase 2 clinical 
  development, including completing additional Phase 1 studies, a Phase 2a/b 
  trial, and additional clinical trials and non-clinical activities to support 
  Phase 3 clinical trials; 

• approximately $7.0 million to fund TRV734 through Phase 1 clinical 
  development; 

• approximately $6.0 million to fund selection of a product candidate from our 
  delta opioid receptor program and IND-enabling studies for such product 
  candidate; 

• approximately $8.0 million to fund research and development to apply our 
  discovery platform to additional GPCRs and to identify biased ligands against 
  those further targets; and 

• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we
believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash
equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through the end of 2015. However, the expected proceeds from this
offering will not be sufficient to complete advanced clinical development of any
of our product candidates, or if applicable, to prepare for commercializing any
product candidate which achieves approval. Accordingly, we will continue to
require substantial additional capital beyond the expected proceeds of this
offering to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization
activities. Because successful development of our product candidates is
uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require to
complete research and development and commercialize our products under
development.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, and could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on
numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the status of and
results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter
into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application

approximately $44.1 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares is exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered
by us in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes:

.  approximately $28.0 million to fund research and development activities,  
   including internal salaries and external costs, related to seeking        
   regulatory approval for MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure, 
   which is comprised of the following:                             

.  approximately $6.0 million to fund the completion of our CUPID 2 clinical 
   trial;                                                       

.  approximately $8.0 million to fund the initiation of our planned AAV1 NAb 
   positive trial;                                                   

.  approximately $1.0 million to fund our viral shedding trial; and

.  approximately $13.0 million to fund the development of manufacturing  
   capabilities for the commercial production of MYDICAR; and            

.  the remainder to fund working capital and general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire,
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets. However
we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash
equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our current operations
through our expected receipt of data from our CUPID 2 trial and preliminary data
from our AAV1 NAb positive trial and viral shedding trial. We also expect that
we will be able to fund commercial scale-up and validation and automation of our
companion diagnostic from our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments.
The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the ongoing status and results of our CUPID 2 clinical trial
of MYDICAR. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will need to secure additional
funding for the further development of MYDICAR, and for the development of any
of our other product candidates.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs
and whether we are able to enter into future licensing arrangements. As a
result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might decide
to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or preclinical activities if the net
proceeds from this offering and the other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

development programs are at an early stage and successful development of product
candidates from these programs is highly uncertain and may not result in
approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly
for each product candidate and are difficult to predict. As a result, we cannot
currently specify in more detail the percentage of the net proceeds that we may
use for each of the listed purposes. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion
in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds

(1)Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their    
   shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
   combination.                                                                 

(2)In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the      
   proceeds of loans and advances from an affiliate of our sponsor (Hennessy    
   Capital LLC) of $250,000 as described in this prospectus. These loans and    
   advances will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $750,000 
   of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering     
   expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering 
   expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be 
   used for post-closing working capital expenses.                                                             

(3)The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.25%
   of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial       
   business combination, up to $3,250,000, which constitutes the underwriters’  
   deferred commissions (or up to $3,737,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
   option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds 
   held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and
   can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
   businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general 
   corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on            
   indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to
   fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The            
   underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred    
   underwriting discounts and commissions.                                      

(4)These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
   these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we  
   may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
   connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon
   the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we        
   identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific    
   regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due      
   diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our      
   staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of           
   consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not      
   anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
   fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
   fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
   category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in 
   the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust     
   account,. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect    
   approximately $20,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds
   held in the trust account over 21 months following the closing of this       
   offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This  
   estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current      
   yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.             

(5)Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
   business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
   financing. 

The rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $100,000,000 (or approximately $115,000,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$3,250,000 (or up to $3,737,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $20,000 per year, assuming an interest rate
of 0.02% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
taxes, if any, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business
combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable
to complete a business combination within 21 months (or 24 months, as
applicable) from the closing of this offering (subject to the requirements of
law). Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that interest earned on
the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we
may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, Hennessy Capital LLC, an affiliate of our
sponsor has loaned and advanced us $250,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. These loans and advances are non-interest bearing,
unsecured and are due at the earlier of March 31, 2014 or the closing of this
offering. These loans and advances will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the
payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $750,000 of such
loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity
at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder. The terms
of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined
and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may 
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain 
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption 
rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any 
net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of 
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an 
alternate business combination. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 21 months following the closing of this
offering (or 24 months from the closing of this offering if we have executed a
letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial
business combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering but have
not completed the initial business combination within such 21-month period),
subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations
(including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the
proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses of $24.7 million payable
by us in connection with the offering, will be approximately $285.3 million, or
approximately $329.4 million if the underwriters exercise in full their right to
purchase additional ordinary shares from us.

We intend to use approximately $134.0 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to redeem 10% of the aggregate principal amount of our senior secured
notes at 103% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
a portion of the net proceeds, together with cash then on hand, to repay
borrowings under our existing senior secured revolving credit facility of $225.0
million and the remaining net proceeds, if any, for general corporate
purposes. The senior secured notes bear interest at an annual rate of 9.25%,
with semi-annual interest payments due on April 15 and October 15, and mature on
October 15, 2020.

As of October 31, 2013, we had $15.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our
existing senior secured revolving credit facility and $53.4 million of letters
of credit were issued and outstanding under such credit facility. Subsequent to
October 31, 2013, the borrowings under our existing senior secured revolving
credit facility increased from $15.0 million by $210.0 million to $225.0 million
as of the date of this prospectus. This indebtedness had a weighted average
interest rate of 7.25% as of October 31, 2013. Our existing senior secured
revolving credit facility matures in 2015. We intend to enter into a new senior
secured revolving credit facility concurrently with the consummation of this
offering. 

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters hold a portion of our indebtedness
being repaid and as a result, may receive a portion of the proceeds from this
offering."

of 3,750,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and structuring fees, but before estimated offering 
expenses. Our estimate assumes the underwriters’ option to purchase additional 
common units from us is not exercised. We expect to distribute all of these 
proceeds to a wholly owned subsidiary of Cypress Holdings as reimbursement for 
certain capital expenditures it incurred with respect to assets contributed to 
us. We intend to pay our estimated offering expenses of approximately $3.0 
million with cash on hand.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the 
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the 
remainder of the 562,500 additional common units, if any, will be issued to a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Cypress Holdings. Any such common units issued to 
Cypress Holdings will be issued for no additional consideration. If the 
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units 
from us, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $80.3 million, 
after deducting underwriting discounts and structuring fees but before 
estimated offering expenses. We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of 
the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units from us to make a 
distribution to a wholly owned subsidiary of Cypress Holdings. Any common units 
not purchased by the underwriters pursuant to their exercise of the option will 
be issued to a wholly owned subsidiary of Cypress Holdings at the expiration of

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $49.6 million, or
approximately $57.4 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares of common stock in full, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as
follows:

. approximately $35.0 million to conduct planned Phase 1 and Phase 1/2       
  clinical trials of GMI-1271; and                                           

. the remainder to fund the research and development of our preclinical      
  pipeline, including drug discovery, and for working capital and other      
  general corporate purposes.                                                

These expected uses represent our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any new
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our drug
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds from this
offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many
factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our
business. Pending these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United
States. The goal with respect to the investment of these net proceeds is capital
preservation and liquidity so that such funds are readily available to fund our
operations."

underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock on a 
national securities exchange and to facilitate our future access to the public 
equity markets. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this 
offering as follows:

We will use the remaining net proceeds, if any, for the further advancement of
our early-stage development programs; for further product development; and for
general corporate purposes, such as general and administrative expenses, working
capital, and prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual property rights.
This offering is also intended to facilitate our future access to public
markets. We reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of
certain contingencies such as competitive developments, the results of our
commercialization efforts, acquisition and investment opportunities and other
factors. We believe that our existing cash and marketable securities as of the
date of this offering, together with the proceeds of this offering, will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for the next 12 months.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to in-license,
acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or 
assets. We may also invest in public equity securities. However we have no 
current plan, commitments or obligations to do so. 

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date 
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts 
and timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous 
factors. As a result, management will have broad discretion in the application 
of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding 
the application of the net proceeds of this offering. Even with the expected 
net proceeds from this offering, we do not expect to have sufficient cash to 
complete the clinical development of any of our product candidates."

by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from us is
exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive additional net proceeds of
approximately $10.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive
any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholder.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
increase our financial flexibility and visibility in the marketplace, to create
a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the
public equity markets. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this
offering for general corporate purposes, including headcount expansion, working
capital, sales and marketing activities, research and product development,
general and administrative matters, and capital expenditures. We may also use a

have no present commitments to complete any such transactions at this time. We
will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds in this offering,
and, as of the date of this prospectus, we have not allocated the net proceeds
to particular uses. Until we use the proceeds we receive from this offering for
the above mentioned purposes, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for our operations and for
other general corporate purposes, including but not limited to working capital

have no understandings, commitments or agreements to consummate any such
acquisition or investment. Our management will have significant flexibility in
applying the net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest
the net proceeds in interest-bearing investment-grade securities or deposits.

Beyond providing us with cash proceeds, the offering will also enable us to
create a public market for our ordinary B shares which, we believe, will further
enhance our prominence in our industry and among our customers. We also believe
that a public market for our ordinary B shares will provide our employees with a
market in which to sell their ordinary B shares (including shares underlying
options) and thereby participate economically in our success, which we believe
will further incentivize employee performance."

approximately $17.3 million if the underwriters exercise their option to

and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock and thereby enable future access to the public equity markets by us
and our stockholders and to obtain additional capital. We currently intend to
use the net proceeds received by us from this offering in the following manner:

.  up to $8.7 million to primarily support debt service under our existing      
   senior secured credit facility with General Electric Capital Corporation, or 
   GE Capital, as agent and lender, and Zions First National Bank, as lender,   
   which we refer to as the GE Secured Lending Facility, as well as to support  
   working capital needs and other general corporate purposes;                  

.  up to $4.0 million to fund research and development and commercialization    
   activities of our product candidates, including the funding of clinical      
   trials we plan to conduct for our product candidates; and                    

.  up to $1.8 million to continue to build sales, marketing and distribution    
   capabilities for our silicon nitride technology platform, including the costs
   of inventory and instruments.                                                

The GE Secured Lending Facility consists of an $18.0 million term loan and up to
a $3.5 million revolving credit facility with General Electric Capital
Corporation, or GE Capital, as agent and lender, and Zions First National Bank,
as lender. As of September 30, 2013, the total outstanding principal and accrued
interest under the GE Secured Lending Facility was $18.0 million although the
financial statements reflect a carrying value of $17.9 million due to the
bifurcated value of warrants issued in connection with the debt. The term loan
due in 2016 consisted of interest only payments until January 1, 2014. Beginning
in January 2014, interest payments as well as monthly principal payments of
approximately $600,000 each are required for a period of 30 months with an
additional $720,000 repayment fee due upon prepayment in full or upon scheduled
maturity and bears an interest rate of 7.5% annually. We amended the terms of
our term loan and credit facility in December 2013 and agreed to pay the lenders
a fee of $860,000 in connection with the execution of this amendment payable no
later than March 1, 2014, provided that the fee is reduced to $645,000 if we
repay all obligations under this facility on or before February 28, 2014. We
further amended the terms of our term loan and credit facility on January 28,
2014 and agreed to pay the lenders a fee of $200,000 on March 31, 2014, if the
facility is not repaid on or before March 31, 2014. This fee is in addition to
the fee required in connection with the prior amendment. The revolving note due
in 2016 bears an interest rate of 5.5% plus the higher of (i) 1.5% and (ii) the
three-month LIBOR, determined as of two London business days divided by a number
equal to 1.0 minus the aggregate of the rates of reserve requirements on the day
that is two London business days prior to the beginning of the interest period
for Eurocurrency funding that are required to be maintained by a member bank of
the Federal Reserve System which resulted in an interest rate of 7.0% at
September 30, 2013. 

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds
to be received upon the completion of the offering. The amount and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon numerous factors,
including the ultimate resolution of our FDA submissions for clearances or
approvals of our product candidates, the specific clinical trial requirements
imposed for market approval of our product candidates, our revenues, operating
costs and capital expenditures. We may find it necessary or advisable to use 
the net proceeds for other purposes, and our management will retain broad 
discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending use of our net proceeds from this offering, we plan to invest the
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments. We cannot predict whether the
net proceeds will yield a favorable return."

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the

    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any 
    such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. 

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $7,350,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or up to $8,452,500 if the underwriters' 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the 
    underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining 
    funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial 
    business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including 
    payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection 
    with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other 
    companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to 
    any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a 
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional 
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special 
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. 

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    business combination to fund a ""no shop"" provision and commitment fees for 
    financing. 
        
Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, approximately $210,000,000 (or approximately $241,500,000 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$7,350,000 (or up to $8,452,500 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S.
government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$21,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.01% per year. Except with
respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us to pay our franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds
from this offering will not be released from the trust account until the earlier
of (a) the completion of our initial business combination or (b) the redemption
of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination
within 21 months from the closing of this offering (or 24 months, as
applicable), subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do
not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes,
will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes for 2013.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the
costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on
the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business
in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth
due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an
affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space,
utilities, secretarial support and administrative services. Upon completion of
our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up
to $200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These
loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 1,
2014 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we
do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant
to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if 
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under 
the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private 
rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time 
of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the 
purchasers will comply with such rules. 

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's ""penny stock"" rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial
business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our
common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the
limitations described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we
are unable to complete our business combination within 21 months following the
closing of this offering (or 24 months from the closing of this offering if we
have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement
for an initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of this
offering but have not completed the initial business combination within such
21-month period), subject to applicable law and as further described herein and
any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us,
pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect
to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of
our initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have
agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account
with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business
combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of
our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$86.7 million.

As of September 30, 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of
$42.6 million. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this

future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents and investments described above, we estimate that such
funds will be sufficient to enable us to conduct our ongoing CTP-354 Phase 1
imaging study and CTP-354 Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial, as
well as two planned Phase 2 clinical trials of CTP-354. We do not expect that
the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents
and investments will be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of
development of any of our product candidates.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government

. approximately $1.5 million to fund the initiation of clinical development
  for an intravenous formulation of Pyridorin for the treatment of AKI in
  which pathogenic oxidative chemistries have been identified as a possible
  contributing factor to the severity of this condition; and

We believe that the remaining clinical development and other studies and work
needed for anticipated FDA and EMA filings for the approval of Pyridorin for the
treatment of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes will require
approximately $45.0 million in addition to the net proceeds from this offering.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents along with the intended

be sufficient to fund the continued development of Pyridorin through the
following events:

. the completion of the first Phase 3 Pyridorin trial;

. the work required for ongoing regulatory obligations (FDA and EMA); and

. preclinical development and initiation of clinical development of an
  intravenous formulation of Pyridorin for AKI.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the status and results of our first Phase 3 Pyridorin trial.

the further development of Pyridorin and for the development of our other
product candidates.

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option, we
estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $45.5
million.

As of September 30, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments of approximately $18.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we
raised an additional $25,992,595 in net proceeds from the sale of shares of
series E preferred stock in October 2013 and November 2013 and received a
payment of $1.0 million and a loan of $9.0 million from Medinet upon our entry
into a license agreement with Medinet in December 2013. We currently estimate
that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments, as follows:

.  approximately $37.0 million to fund the direct costs of our pivotal phase 3 
   clinical trial of AGS-003 for the treatment of metastatic renal cell 
   carcinoma, or mRCC;                                                

.  approximately $2.0 million to fund the direct costs of the planned phase 2 
   clinical trials of AGS-003 in non-clear cell mRCC, early stage RCC prior to 
   and following nephrectomy and other solid tumors;              

.  approximately $1.6 million to fund the manufacturing costs of the planned 
   phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 for HIV eradication and the direct costs 
   of our planned phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 for long-term viral control
   in pediatric patients, assuming we do not obtain NIH funding for the phase 2
   clinical trial in pediatric patients;       

.  approximately $1.0 million to initiate the planned leasing, build-out and 
   equipping of a new commercial manufacturing facility;               

.  $200,000 to pay a success fee to a former lender under a loan agreement that 
   we have previously repaid in full; and 

.  the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments represents our intentions based upon
our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development and commercialization efforts, the status of and
results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter
into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current
agreements, commitments or understandings for any material acquisitions or
licenses of any products, businesses or technologies.

We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and anticipated funding under
our NIH contract, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements into the second half of 2016, including funding our
ongoing pivotal phase 3 clinical trial of AGS-003, our planned phase 2 clinical
trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004 and approximately $1.0 million for the initiation
of the planned leasing, build-out and equipping of a new commercial
manufacturing facility. However, it is possible that we will not achieve the
progress that we expect in our ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of AGS-003 or our
planned additional clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004 because the actual
costs and timing of development, particularly clinical trials, are difficult to
predict and subject to substantial risks and delays including slower than
anticipated patient enrollment.

We do not expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments described above will be sufficient
to enable us to complete our planned leasing, build-out and equipping of a new
North American commercial manufacturing facility, which we expect will require
an additional approximately $35.0 million prior to the commercialization of

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $43.5 million,
based on the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share and after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be 
approximately $50.5 million.

As of September 30, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 million. In 
December 2013, we received $9.0 million in cash proceeds from our series B 
preferred stock financing. We currently estimate that we will use the net 
proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash 
equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $36 million to fund external research and development expenses 
  for our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for EBI-005 in patients with 
  moderate to severe dry eye disease and, if the results from this program are 
  favorable, the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the 
  United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, seeking approval of 
  EBI-005 for the treatment of dry eye disease in the United States;

. approximately $3 million to fund external research and development expenses 
  for our Phase 2 clinical trial of EBI-005 in patients with allergic 
  conjunctivitis; and

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which 
  will include our internal research and development expenses for EBI-005, 
  development of our preclinical product candidates and pursuit of our other 
  research and discovery efforts and could also include the acquisition or 
  in-license of other products, product candidates or technologies.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and 
cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and 
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business 
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary 
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our 
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any 
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product 
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will 
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this 
offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or understandings for any 
material acquisitions or licenses of any products, businesses or technologies.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our 
existing cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds 
will be sufficient to enable us to complete our pivotal Phase 3 clinical 
program for EBI-005 in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease, submit 
a BLA to the FDA seeking approval of EBI-005 for the treatment of dry eye 
disease in the United States in the second half of 2016 and complete our Phase 
2 clinical trial of EBI-005 in patients with allergic conjunctivitis. We do not 
anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and 
cash equivalents will be sufficient to allow us to commercialize EBI-005.

net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-
term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government

sufficient to fund our operations for a period of eighteen months after the
consummation of this offering."

  monthly installments beginning in July 2012.

. Approximately $7 million to make payments under our settlement agreement with

approximately $534.8 million, or approximately $615.0 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, in
each case after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions related to
this offering. Pursuant to the completion of the CBS reorganization
transactions, we will transfer to a wholly owned subsidiary of CBS the
Transferred Offering Proceeds, which is an amount equal to the net proceeds of
this offering less an amount, as determined by CBS, equal to the estimated cash
portion of the Purging Distribution(s). We estimate that the Transferred
Offering Proceeds will be approximately $434.8 million, or approximately
$515.0 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares in full.

In addition, in connection with the Formation Borrowings, we incurred $1.6
billion of indebtedness, from which we received net proceeds of approximately
$1.57 billion after deducting bank fees, discounts and commissions incurred in
connection therewith. Pursuant to the completion of the CBS reorganization
transactions, we transferred to such wholly owned subsidiary of CBS the
Transferred Borrowing Proceeds of approximately $1.52 billion, which is an
amount equal to the net proceeds of the Formation Borrowings less $50 million,
which remained with us to use for corporate purposes and ongoing cash needs, as
described below.

We paid the Transferred Borrowing Proceeds (following the consummation of the
Formation Borrowings) and we will pay the Transferred Offering Proceeds
(following the consummation of this offering) to such wholly owned subsidiary of
CBS (together with shares of CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. common stock) in
consideration for the contribution of the entities comprising CBS’s Outdoor
Americas operating segment to us pursuant to the CBS reorganization
transactions. After making these payments, we expect that we will have retained
approximately $150.0 million, which will include the amounts retained by us from
the proceeds of the Formation Borrowings and this offering, as described above,
which we will use for corporate purposes and ongoing cash needs and which we
believe will provide us with sufficient liquidity to pay the cash portion of any
Purging Distribution(s) if CBS completes the Separation by means of the
split-off and we elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Based on the initial public offering price of $28.00 per share, we
currently estimate that the Purging Distribution(s) will total approximately
$500.0 million, of which approximately 20% will be paid in cash and
approximately 80% will be paid in shares of our common stock. The actual amount
of the Purging Distribution(s) will be calculated as of a future date and could
be materially different from our current estimates based on a number of factors,
including (1) the relative market capitalizations of our company and CBS, (2)
the timing of our REIT election and the split-off (if any), (3) the financial
performance of CBS, our company and our respective subsidiaries through the
closing of the split-off (if any) and (4) for the share portion of our Purging
Distribution(s), the per-share market value of our common stock at the time of
distribution. Accordingly, these estimates should not be relied upon as an
indicator of what the actual cash portion and stock portion of our Purging
Distribution(s) will be. Following the final payment of the Purging
Distribution(s) declared in our first REIT taxable year, if any, we will pay to
CBS, or CBS will pay to us, as applicable, the difference between the actual
cash portion of such Purging Distribution(s) and the estimated cash portion of
such Purging Distribution(s) that was retained by us as described above (which
could differ from the estimates disclosed herein)."

.  create a public market for our common stock;
 
.  facilitate our future access to the public capital markets;

use of proceeds and the alternate purposes for which the proceeds may be used
include:

  advantage of changes in timing of our existing activities;

  one or more existing initiatives due to, among other things, changing market 
  conditions and competitive developments or interim results of research and 
  development efforts;  

. results from our business development and marketing efforts;  

. the effect of federal, state, and local regulation on our business; and  

. the presentation of strategic opportunities of which we are not currently 
  aware (including acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and other similar

receive from this offering. The principal purposes of this offering are to
increase our capital for underwriting activities, to obtain additional capital,
to create a public market for our ordinary shares and to facilitate our future
access to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering to provide additional long-term working capital, in the form of
unrestricted cash, to support the growth of our business by providing us with
financial flexibility. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to pursue acquisitions and expansions of the reinsurance products that
we offer in existing and new markets. We have no commitments with respect to any
such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved in any
negotiations with respect to any such transaction. In the event that we sell
only the minimum number of units offered, and therefore, receive only the
minimum amount of offering proceeds, we would have less working capital with
which to pursue the foregoing. Pending the use by us and by our reinsurance
subsidiary (Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited) of such proceeds, we will invest such
proceeds in interest-bearing securities consistent with our current investment

Except as described above, we have no immediate need for the proceeds we will
receive from this offering. The principal purposes of this offering are to
increase our capital for underwriting activities, to obtain additional capital,
to create a public market for our ordinary shares and to facilitate our future
access to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering to provide additional long-term working capital, in the form of
unrestricted cash, to support the growth of our business by providing us with
financial flexibility. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to pursue acquisitions and expansions of the reinsurance products that
we offer in existing and new markets. We have no commitments with respect to any
such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved in any
negotiations with respect to any such transaction. In the event that we sell
only the minimum number of units offered, and therefore, receive only the
minimum amount of offering proceeds, we would have less working capital with
which to pursue the foregoing. Pending the use by us and by our reinsurance
subsidiary (Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited) of such proceeds, we will invest such
proceeds in interest-bearing securities consistent with our current investment
policies."

receive from this offering. The principal purposes of this offering are to
increase our capital for underwriting activities, to obtain additional capital,
to create a public market for our ordinary shares and to facilitate our future
access to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering to provide additional long-term working capital, in the form of
unrestricted cash, to support the growth of our business by providing us with
financial flexibility. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to pursue acquisitions and expansions of the reinsurance products that
we offer in existing and new markets. We have no commitments with respect to any
such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved in any
negotiations with respect to any such transaction. In the event that we sell
only the minimum number of units offered, and therefore, receive only the
minimum amount of offering proceeds, we would have less working capital with
which to pursue the foregoing. Pending the use by us and by our reinsurance
subsidiary (Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited) of such proceeds, we will invest such
proceeds in interest-bearing securities consistent with our current investment
policies."

Except as described above, we have no immediate need for the proceeds we will
receive from this offering. The principal purposes of this offering are to
increase our capital for underwriting activities, to obtain additional capital,
to create a public market for our ordinary shares and to facilitate our future
access to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering to provide additional long-term working capital, in the form of
unrestricted cash, to support the growth of our business by providing us with
financial flexibility. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to pursue acquisitions and expansions of the reinsurance products that
we offer in existing and new markets. We have no commitments with respect to any
such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved in any
negotiations with respect to any such transaction. In the event that we sell
only the minimum number of units offered, and therefore, receive only the
minimum amount of offering proceeds, we would have less working capital with
which to pursue the foregoing. Pending the use by us and by our reinsurance
subsidiary (Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited) of such proceeds, we will invest such
proceeds in interest-bearing securities consistent with our current investment
policies."

receive from this offering. The principal purposes of this offering are to
increase our capital for underwriting activities, to obtain additional capital,
to create a public market for our ordinary shares and to facilitate our future
access to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering to provide additional long-term working capital, in the form of
unrestricted cash, to support the growth of our business by providing us with
financial flexibility. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to pursue acquisitions and expansions of the reinsurance products that
we offer in existing and new markets. We have no commitments with respect to any
such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved in any
negotiations with respect to any such transaction. In the event that we sell
only the minimum number of units offered, and therefore, receive only the
minimum amount of offering proceeds, we would have less working capital with
which to pursue the foregoing. Pending the use by us and by our reinsurance
subsidiary (Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited) of such proceeds, we will invest such
proceeds in interest-bearing securities consistent with our current investment
policies."

receive from this offering. The principal purposes of this offering are to
increase our capital for underwriting activities, to obtain additional capital,
to create a public market for our ordinary shares and to facilitate our future
access to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering to provide additional long-term working capital, in the form of
unrestricted cash, to support the growth of our business by providing us with
financial flexibility. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to pursue acquisitions and expansions of the reinsurance products that
we offer in existing and new markets. We have no commitments with respect to any
such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved in any
negotiations with respect to any such transaction. In the event that we sell
only the minimum number of units offered, and therefore, receive only the
minimum amount of offering proceeds, we would have less working capital with
which to pursue the foregoing. Pending the use by us and by our reinsurance
subsidiary (Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited) of such proceeds, we will invest such
proceeds in interest-bearing securities consistent with our current investment
policies."

Except as described above, we have no immediate need for the proceeds we will
receive from this offering. The principal purposes of this offering are to
increase our capital for underwriting activities, to obtain additional capital,
to create a public market for our ordinary shares and to facilitate our future
access to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering to provide additional long-term working capital, in the form of
unrestricted cash, to support the growth of our business by providing us with
financial flexibility. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to pursue acquisitions and expansions of the reinsurance products that
we offer in existing and new markets. We have no commitments with respect to any
such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved in any
negotiations with respect to any such transaction. In the event that we sell
only the minimum number of units offered, and therefore, receive only the
minimum amount of offering proceeds, we would have less working capital with
which to pursue the foregoing. Pending the use by us and by our reinsurance
subsidiary (Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited) of such proceeds, we will invest such
proceeds in interest-bearing securities consistent with our current investment
policies."

offered by us in this offering will be $51.4 million, or $59.3 million if the
underwriters elect to exercise in full their purchase option and after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses. Each $1.00 increase or
decrease in the initial public offering price would increase or decrease the net
proceeds to us from this offering by $2.9 million, or $3.4 million if the
underwriters’ purchase option is exercised in full. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the selling shareholders. We
expect to downstream approximately 90% of the net proceeds of the offering to
Square 1 Bank.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us generated by this offering to support
our long-term growth by enhancing our capital ratios in light of the heightened
capital standards under Basel III, and for general working capital and other
corporate purposes. We intend, as a secondary purpose of the offering, to use
the net proceeds to redeem, at the first quarterly redemption date following the
offering, any Series A preferred stock and to retire any indebtedness relating
to Square 1 Financial’s trust preferred securities that remain outstanding
following the completion of this offering. Our trust preferred securities and
Series A preferred stock are currently redeemable by the Company, at its option,
on any quarterly dividend payment date. No premium is attached to such
redemption. Such redemption would require approval of the Federal Reserve, which
approval has not yet been sought. As our preferred stock and our trust preferred
securities are currently convertible, at the option of the holder, into common
stock at a conversion price of $10.00 per share, we expect that a significant
portion of the $7.4 million in outstanding trust preferred securities and the
$5.0 million in outstanding Series A preferred stock will be converted into
common stock prior to the redemption date. Although we may, from time to time in
the ordinary course of business, evaluate potential acquisition and business
line expansion opportunities that we believe are complementary to our business
and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns, we do not have any immediate
plans, arrangements or understandings relating to any material acquisition. Our
management will retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this
offering. The precise amounts and timing of our use of the proceeds will depend
upon market conditions, among other factors.

The selling shareholders will receive the proceeds from sales by the selling
shareholders in this offering, which are estimated to be, before expenses,
approximately $44.7 million in the aggregate, or approximately $51.4 million in
the aggregate if the underwriters elect to exercise in full their purchase
option."

offered by us of approximately $218.4 million, based upon the initial public 
offering price of $16.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders. 

The principal purpose of this offering is to repay approximately $215.0 million
of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, increase our equity 
capitalization and financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the 
marketplace and create a public market for our common stock. 

Our credit facilities consist of (a) a first lien credit facility, which 
provides for a $75.0 million revolving credit facility, a $175.0 million tranche
B-1 term loan and a $455.0 million tranche B-2 term loan, and (b) a second lien 
credit facility, which provides for a $190.0 million term loan. As of December 
31, 2013, we had an aggregate of $818.4 million of indebtedness outstanding 
under our senior secured credit facilities. We intend to repay the entire 
$190.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under our second lien term loan and 
$25.0 million of the indebtedness outstanding under our $175.0 million tranche 
B-1 term loan with the net proceeds of this offering. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the 
particular uses for any remaining net proceeds to us from this offering. 
However, we currently intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering 
primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and 
marketing activities, general and administrative matters and capital 
expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering 
for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses
that complement our business, although we have no present commitments or 
agreements to enter into any such acquisitions or investments. We will have 
broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending 
these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities such as money market 
funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of 
the U.S. government."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $44.9 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$51.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash and
cash equivalents on hand, to continue the clinical trials of our XLRS and ACHM
product candidates beyond the Phase 1/2 stages (which we believe are already
adequately funded), expand preclinical studies of our XLRP product candidate,
and explore potential applications of our gene therapy platform in other
indications in orphan ophthalmology.

Specifically, we intend to apply the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

. approximately $10.6 million to fund a Phase 1/2 clinical trial and, if that 
  is successful, to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 trial of our XLRS product 
  candidate; 

. approximately $17.9 million to fund a Phase 1/2 clinical trial and, if that 
  is successful, to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 trial of our ACHM product 
  candidate;

. approximately $5.0 million to fund additional preclinical studies of our XLRP
  product candidate;

. approximately $2.3 million to explore, through early preclinical studies, 
  potential applications of our gene therapy platform in other indications in 
  orphan ophthalmology; and 

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets, though we have no
present plans to make any such acquisition or investment. Pending the use of the
net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Due to the many
variables inherent in the development of gene therapy products at this time,
such as the timing of patient enrollment, the timing and results of preclinical
animal studies and clinical trials and the timing of regulatory submissions and
evolving regulatory requirements, the amount and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon such variables and we cannot currently predict the
stage of development we expect the net proceeds of this offering to achieve for
our clinical studies and product candidates.

As a result, we will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might decide
to postpone or not pursue certain clinical trials or preclinical activities if
the net proceeds from this offering and the other sources of cash are less than
expected."

. approximately $7 – $8 million to fund our planned Phase 1/2 initial clinical
  trial of RUT58-60, to conduct research and development activities for 
  additional indications, and to establish an independent research facility;

. approximately $1.5 million in milestone payments to Oculus, payable upon   
  completion of last patient enrollment in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial; and

. approximately $6 million for general corporate purposes and working capital.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the status of and results from clinical trials of RUT58-60. As a
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use
the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. Furthermore,
we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding for the further
development of RUT58-60 or commercially launch RUT58-60 in the United States.

As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately

expect because the actual costs and timing of drug development, particularly
clinical studies, are difficult to predict, subject to substantial risks and
delays and often vary depending on the particular indication and development
strategy. We do not expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our

We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as 
follows:

. approximately $25-$30 million to expand our sales and marketing 
  infrastructure;

. approximately $25-$30 million on research and development; 

. approximately $10 million to expand our manufacturing capabilities; and

. the balance, if any, for other general corporate purposes.

Additionally, our management estimates that the majority of the net proceeds 
from this offering allocated to research and development will be spent on the

States and the pediatric trial in the European Union. The balance of such 
research and development funding is expected to be allocated to the continued 
development of EscharEx for debridement of chronic and other hard-to-heal 
wounds and of our proteolytic enzyme technology for the treatment of connective 
tissue disorders. Although the costs associated with such research and 
development plans are uncertain, our management currently believes that the use 
of approximately $25-$30 million on research and development will be sufficient 
to fund our Phase III trial for NexoBrid in the United States and our pediatric 
trial in the European Union until completion.

Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds. 
Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in 
interest-bearing investment-grade securities or deposits."

$76.0 million, based upon the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, the net proceeds to us will be approximately $81.8 million, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
payable by us.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by
the selling stockholders.

The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, increase our visibility in the market place and create a public
market for our common stock.

We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay
amounts outstanding under a note issued by us to Commerce Bank & Trust Company
on March 9, 2011. As of December 31, 2013, we had $1.3 million outstanding under
this note. The note bears interest at 6.50% per annum, payable monthly, and
matures on December 31, 2015. Amounts borrowed under the note were used for
working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Following the completion of this offering, we will have the right to acquire
one of our resellers at any time. If we elect to acquire this reseller in the
future, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to effect
such purchase. However, we do not currently know when we would effect this
acquisition or the purchase price to be paid to acquire the reseller. The
purchase price would be determined at the time of the acquisition as a three
times multiple of the annualized value of the amounts, net of certain
reductions, paid by us to the reseller during the three months preceding such
acquisition. We paid the reseller $1.0 million and $1.4 million during the six
month periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

We do not have current specific plans for the use of a significant portion
of the net proceeds from this offering. We generally intend to use the balance
of the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and other general
corporate purposes, including to finance our growth, enhance and improve our
products and services, fund capital expenditures, or expand our existing
business through investments in or acquisitions of other businesses, solutions,
or technologies. However, we do not have any commitments for any such
investments or acquisitions at this time.

Pending the uses mentioned above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of
this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds to
us from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our

The principal purpose of this offering is to obtain additional capital to

net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to
obtain rights to such complementary technologies. We have no commitments with
respect to any such acquisitions or investments.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the net
proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses
and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. The amount
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors,
including the status of our clinical trials relating to RXDX-101, and other
factors described under “Risk Factors” in this prospectus, as well as the amount
of cash used in our operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the
net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the use of

our operations through the end of 2016. In the event that our plans change, our
assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate, or the net proceeds of this
offering are less than as set forth herein or otherwise prove to be
insufficient, it may be necessary or advisable to reallocate proceeds or curtail
expansion activities, or we may be required to seek additional financing or

the sale of 2,837,400 Shares offered by us in this offering (or approximately
$39,728,733 if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full),
based on the public offering price of $13.50 per Share, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for clinical
trials and product development, working capital and general corporate purposes
of the Company. In particular, we expect to use the net proceeds as follows: (i)
approximately $10.0 million for the initiation and completion of the Phase IIb
clinical trial of aramchol for the treatment of NASH in patients who also suffer
from obesity and insulin resistance; (ii) in connection with such clinical
trial, approximately $5.0 million for establishing and building a research and
development infrastructure in the United States, including for the engagement of
a new vice president for North America, Phase III clinical trials,
pre-commercialization activities, raising disease awareness for NASH,
communications with the scientific and medical communities, physicians,
third-party payors, future partners and collaborators and investor relations,
which we believe may increase our operations and presence within the United
States; (iii) approximately $5.0 million for the performance of other studies in
connection with our product candidate, including, but not limited to, PK studies
and food effect studies, each prior to the consummation of our proposed Phase
IIb clinical trial, proof of concept studies with respect to the use of aramchol
for the treatment of cholesterol gallstones, the development of salt
formulations of aramchol, as opposed to the free acid form, and bioequivalence
studies with existing formulations of aramchol; and (iv) for working capital and
general corporate purposes of the Company. Pending such usage, we expect to
invest the proceeds in short term interest-bearing instruments.

We will require significant additional funds to initiate and complete the
approval process of the FDA, EMA or any other applicable regulatory authority.
However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly
faster than we currently anticipate. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from our
clinical trials, whether or not we enter into strategic collaborations or
partnerships, and our operating costs and expenditures.

We have no current understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any
material acquisition of or investment in any technologies, products or

full amount of funding from our BARDA contract, including under the unexercised
option, we expect such funds, together with the proceeds from this offering,
will be sufficient to fund our development of plazomicin through receipt of
top-line data from our Phase 3 trial. We anticipate that we will need to raise
substantial additional financing in the future to fund our operations, including
for obtaining marketing approval for plazomicin. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the timing and speed of enrollment of our pivotal Phase 3 superiority
trial of plazomicin, the status of our research and development programs, the
continued receipt of funding under our contract with BARDA, and whether

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses

their option to purchase additional ordinary shares in full.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as
follows:

. approximately $30.0 million to more than double the size of our direct sales 
  force in the United States by the end of 2014; 
 
. approximately $15.0 million to develop a Thoracic stent-graft system; and 

. the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may 
  include acquisitions or investments in other businesses, technologies or 
  product candidates. 
 
This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products,
businesses or technologies.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

Pending use of the proceeds of this offering, we will invest the net proceeds of
this offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing instruments. We
intend to use $12,500,000 of net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion
of the debt currently outstanding under the DB Lines. The proceeds for the
portion of the credit line being repaid were used primarily for working capital
and general corporate purposes during the preceding 12 months. Repayment of the
DB Lines is guaranteed by Mr. Sillerman. Pursuant to the terms of the guarantee,
Mr. Sillerman unconditionally guaranteed to Deutsche Bank the payment in full
when due of all amounts outstanding under the DB Line, including costs and
expenses of collection, if any. Accordingly, repayment of $12,500,000 of net
proceeds to pay down a portion of the debt currently outstanding under the DB
Line will reduce Mr. Sillerman's current obligation to guarantee the DB Lines by
$12,500,000.  We intend to use the remaining net proceeds received from this
offering for marketing and sales, working capital and general corporate
purposes. We currently anticipate that, after giving effect to the application
of proceeds described above, the balance of the net proceeds of this offering,
together with our available funds, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least 12 months
following the closing of this offering. We anticipate that after 12 months from
the closing of this offering, additional financing may be needed. No assurance
can be given that such additional financing will be available on terms
acceptable to us, if at all.

The allocation of the net proceeds of this offering set forth above represents
our best estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding
industry and general economic conditions and our future revenues and
expenditures. If any of these factors change, it may be necessary or advisable
for us to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-described categories
or to use portions for other purposes. Investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding application of the net proceeds of this offering."

stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share,
after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by us, will be approximately $45.2 million, or $52.8 million if
the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital for the
development and possible approval of the ELAD System, create a public market for
our common stock, and facilitate our future access to the public equity markets.
We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund the clinical
development of the ELAD System, and any remainder for working capital and other
corporate purposes.

We currently estimate allocating approximately $19 million, $22 million and
$3 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund certain costs expected
to be incurred in connection with our VTI-208 Phase 3 clinical trial, VTI-210
Phase 3 clinical trial and VTI-212 Phase 2 clinical trial, respectively, over
the next 21 months. These costs include clinical site costs, clinical operations
costs, clinical manufacturing costs, and costs associated with clinical shipping
and testing. This allocation among the clinical trials is based on the expected
relative number of patients to be enrolled in each trial. To the extent our
actual net proceeds from this offering are insufficient to fund this allocation,
we expect to use some of our existing cash and cash equivalents to fund any
difference.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations over the next
21 months. In particular, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering
and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund
development through the completion of enrollment and receipt of topline data
from our VTI-208 Phase 3 clinical trial and the completion of enrollment of our
VTI-210 Phase 3 clinical trial. We may need to raise additional funds prior to
completion of enrollment of our VTI-212 Phase 2 clinical trial.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and total funds
available to us following the completion of this offering described above
represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions.
As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors,
including the rate of subject enrollment in our clinical trials, filing
requirements with various regulatory agencies, clinical trial results, and any
unforeseen cash needs. Our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds
in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of
our stock. Pending use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest
the proceeds in a variety of short-term investment-grade and interest-bearing
instruments, direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government, or
certificates of deposits."

stock offered by us will be approximately $588 million or approximately $677 
million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares 
in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay an aggregate of 
approximately $206 million of our outstanding indebtedness under the Term C 
Facility portion of our senior secured credit facilities. The Term C Facility 
matures in December 2017 and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR (subject to a 
1.00% floor) plus 3.00%. We also intend to redeem $320 million aggregate 
principal amount of the 8.5% senior secured notes due May 2019 at a redemption 
price of 108.5% of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes redeemed, plus 
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. We also 
intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering to pay a $21 
million fee, in the aggregate, to TPG and Silver Lake pursuant to the MSA, 
which will thereafter be terminated.

If the underwriters exercise their option to acquire additional shares of 
common stock, we intend to use any net proceeds we receive to repay additional 
outstanding indebtedness under the Term C Facility.

By establishing a public market for our common stock, this offering is also 
intended to facilitate our future access to public markets.

Prior to the closing of this offering, we will exercise our right to redeem all 
of our Series A Preferred Stock. The redemption price will be paid with shares 
of our common stock, which we will deliver pro rata to the holders thereof 
concurrently with the closing of this offering. Upon the closing of this 
offering, we will deliver 40,203,879 shares of our common stock in payment of 
the related Redemption Payment as of March 31, 2014. Accordingly, such amounts 
do not take into account shares of our common stock to be issued in 
satisfaction of dividends that accrue on or after April 1, 2014 and to, but 
excluding, the closing date of this offering. Each share of Series A Preferred 
Stock accumulates dividends at a rate of 6% per annum. Such dividends will 
accrue at a rate of approximately $107,000 per day in the aggregate. The common 
stock delivered in the Redemption will be valued at the initial public offering 
price and will also reflect shares of common stock to be issued in satisfaction 
of dividends that accrue on or after April 1, 2014 and to, but excluding, the 
closing date of this offering.

Certain affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC, an underwriter in this offering, 
will own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock following 
this offering."

approximately $70.3 million, based upon the initial public offering price of
$9.50 per share and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and our estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters exercise their option
to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate additional net proceeds of
approximately $4.1 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares of our common stock by the selling stockholder, including any shares sold
by the selling stockholder in connection with the exercise of the underwriters’
option to purchase additional shares.

We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this offering to repay amounts
outstanding under our term loans on a pro rata basis between the two tranches
(described below). If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares, we intend to use the additional net proceeds for general
corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of additional amounts
outstanding under our term loans. Pending any specific application, we intend to
invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade,
interest-bearing securities such as money market funds, commercial paper or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

Our $235.0 million term loan facility consists of a $185.0 million tranche and a
$50.0 million tranche, each with a scheduled maturity date of August 20, 2019.
As of February 1, 2014, there was $233.8 million outstanding under the term
loans. The term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the one-, two-,
three-, or six-month LIBOR (or, if available to all relevant lenders, the nine-
or 12-month LIBOR), as defined in the term loan agreement, at our election,
which cannot be less than 1.25%, plus an applicable margin of 6.00% and 10.75%
for the $185.0 million tranche and $50.0 million tranche, respectively. Since
LIBOR has been less than 1.25% since the inception of the term loans through
February 1, 2014, the interest rates have been fixed at 7.25% and 12.0% on the
$185.0 million tranche and $50.0 million tranche, respectively.

Our revolving credit facility requires us to use the proceeds from this offering
to repay all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We have
received a waiver from Wells Fargo, the lender under our revolving credit
facility, of this requirement."

providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

. approximately $40.0 million to enhance our technology infrastructure and

  China; and 

. the balance for general corporate purposes, including funding potential 
  acquisitions of complementary businesses and strategic investments, although

Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or

proceeds that we will receive from this offering will be approximately $62.0
million, or approximately $72.1 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full. We will contribute the net proceeds of this
offering to our operating partnership in exchange for common units, and we
expect that our operating partnership will use the proceeds as described below:

.  approximately $19.4 million to acquire interests in our initial properties, 
   including the payment of transaction expenses in connection with the

redeem from the Second City Group, for cash, a portion of the common stock and
common units issued to them in the formation transactions at a redemption price

Pending application of the net proceeds, our Advisor will invest the net
proceeds from this offering for our benefit in interest-bearing accounts and
short-term,interest-bearing securities in a manner that is consistent with our
intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT. These investments are expected to
provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from our investment in

    property, which bears interest at 6.00% and matures in June 2014, a $10
    million mortgage loan secured by the Central Fairwinds property, which bears
    interest at 6.25% and matures in October 2015, and a $19.5 million mortgage

estimated underwriting discounts of approximately $8.4 million and offering
expenses of approximately $2.4 million (after giving effect to the reimbursement
of certain expenses by the underwriters) payable by us, will be approximately
$114.2 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock by us in
this offering, together with the proceeds from our New Credit Facilities, to
repay certain of our outstanding indebtedness, to pay related fees and expenses
and for general corporate purposes. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the sale of shares by Mayflower, the selling stockholder in this offering. 

Concurrently with and conditioned upon this offering, we expect to enter into
$390 million in New Credit Facilities. The 2014 Revolving Credit Facility is
expected to have an interest rate of 2.75% plus LIBOR. The 2014 Senior Secured
Term Loan Facility is expected to have an interest rate of 3.00% plus LIBOR,
with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%. A portion of the proceeds from the New Credit
Facilities, together with the net proceeds of this offering, will be used to
repay in full our 9.25% senior notes due July 1, 2018, the amounts currently
outstanding under the term loan payable to Mayflower, the term loan payable to
BFI and the Domestic Senior Credit Facility and pay fees and expenses. Upon
completion of this offering, we expect no additional amounts to be available
under the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and $100.0 million to be
available under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility (not giving effect to
approximately $17.3 million of existing letters of credit that are expected to
remain outstanding under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, and which will
reduce such availability). The Domestic Senior Credit Facility will be
terminated following such repayment. The resulting estimated annual interest
savings are expected to be $20.8 million. We will record a loss on
extinguishment of debt of approximately $24.1 million upon repayment of our
existing debt. Our Principal Stockholders are the lenders under our existing
term loans. 

An affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated is the
Administrative Agent with respect to our Domestic Senior Credit Facility. In
addition, an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated is
a lender under our Domestic Senior Credit Facility and will receive its
respective share of any repayment by us of amounts outstanding under our
Domestic Senior Credit Facility with the net proceeds of this offering. 

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of proceeds in
connection with the sale of Class A common stock and entry into the New Credit
Facilities by us, assuming this offering had occurred on December 31, 2013.

exercised in full.

We intend to contribute the net proceeds from this offering to our operating
partnership in exchange for OP units, and our operating partnership intends to
use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $12.0 million to repay outstanding indebtedness, of
  which $766,000 was advanced by Pittman Hough Farms and will be

  from this offering;

• approximately $55,000 (exclusive of the $766,000 to be reimbursed for

(1) Amounts based on outstanding balances as of December 31, 2013.

(2) Effective annual interest rate as of December 31, 2013.

(3) The multi-property loan, or the Multi-Property Loan, which had an
    outstanding balance of $34.5 million as of December 31, 2013, is
    ollateralized by 27 farms and two grain storage facilities that are being
    acquired by us in connection with the formation transactions, as well as
    certain properties that are not being acquired by us in connection with the
    formation transactions because we do not believe that those properties are
    consistent with our investment criteria and business and growth strategies.
    We intend to repay $4.5 million of the outstanding balance of the
    Multi-Property Loan with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
    in order to release the collateral that is not being acquired by us in
    connection with the formation transactions, of which $766,000 was advanced
    by Pittman Hough Farms and will be reimbursed to Pittman Hough Farms
    with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. 

(4)  The Zeagers loan, which had an outstanding balance of $1.8 million as of
     December 31, 2013, is collateralized by the Zeagers farm, which is being
     acquired by us in connection with the formation transactions, as well as
     one property that is not being acquired by us in connection with the
     formation transactions because we do not believe that such property is
     consistent with our investment criteria and business and growth strategies.
     We intend to repay $1.0 million of the outstanding balance of the Zeagers
     loan with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering in order to
     release the collateral that is not being acquired by us in connection with
     the formation transactions. The remaining $0.8 million principal balance of
     the loan will be assumed by us and remain outstanding following completion
     of the formation transactions and this offering.

(5)  Merrill loan is collateralized by a property not being acquired by us
     in the formation transactions and is cross-collateralized by the John's
     Shop farm, which is being acquired by us in the formation transactions. We
     do not believe that the property serving as the primary collateral for the
     Merrill Loan is consistent with our investment criteria and our business
     and growth strategies. Therefore, we intend to repay the Merrill Loan with
     a portion of the net proceeds from this offering in order to acquire the
     John's Shop farm free and clear of any encumbrances.

(6)  The Trone loan is collateralized by a property not being acquired by us in
     the formation transactions because we do not believe that such property is
     consistent with our investment criteria and our business and growth
     strategies. We intend to repay the Trone loan with a portion of the net
     proceeds from this offering because proceeds from the Trone loan were used
     by our Predecessor (i) to acquire properties that are being acquired by us
     in connection with the formation transactions, including the Zeagers farm
     and the Symond farm, and (ii) for working capital in the business of our
     Predecessor, including interest payments on debt secured by properties
     being acquired by us in connection with the formation transactions.

Pending application of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing accounts, money market accounts and
interest-bearing securities in a manner that is consistent with our intention to
qualify for taxation as a REIT. Such investments may include, for example,
government and government agency certificates, government bonds, certificates of
deposit, interest-bearing bank deposits, money market accounts and mortgage loan
participations. We expect that these initial investments will provide a lower
net return than we expect to receive from the investments described above."

fee and offering expenses. We intend to use: 

. approximately $453 million of the net proceeds of this offering for general 
  partnership purposes, including the funding of expansion capital expenditures; 
  and 

. approximately $13 million of the net proceeds of this offering to pre-fund 
  demand fees expected to be incurred over the next three years relating to 
  certain expiring transportation and storage contracts. 
 
Pending application of the net proceeds as described in the bullets above, we
may temporarily pay down debt outstanding under our commercial paper program and
revolving credit facility. We utilize our revolving credit facility and
commercial paper program to manage the timing of cash flows and fund short-term
working capital deficits. As of February 28, 2014, $430 million was outstanding
under our commercial paper program, with a weighted average interest rate of
0.90%, and there were no other outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit
facility. Our revolving credit facility matures in May 2018.

ArcLight, the selling unitholder, has granted the underwriters a 30-day option
to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,750,000 additional common units to the
extent the underwriters sell more than 25,000,000 common units in this offering.
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common units by the selling
unitholder pursuant to any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional common units. The selling unitholder may be deemed under federal
securities laws to be an underwriter with respect to the common units it may
sell in connection with this offering. If the underwriters exercise in full
their option to purchase additional common units, the ownership interest of the
public unitholders will increase to 28,750,000 common units, representing an
aggregate 6.9% limited partner interest in us.

The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform
services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business.
Affiliates of each of the underwriters are lenders under our revolving credit
facility and will, in that respect, receive a portion of the proceeds from this
offering through any repayment of borrowings outstanding under our revolving
credit facility pending the application of the net proceeds as described above."

underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $61.5 million.

As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
$5.5 million. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with $8.5 million from the sale of our 2014 notes in the
first quarter of 2014 and our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

  •   approximately $26.0 million to fund clinical development of CRLX101;

from clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our planned randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of
CRLX101 in combination with Avastin in relapsed renal cell carcinoma, to support
the ongoing CRLX101 investigator-sponsored trials, to fund our planned Phase 1
clinical trial of CRLX301 and to fund our operating expenses, debt service and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 18 months. We do not
expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash
equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of clinical
development of any of our product candidates.

interest-bearing, investment-grade securities and U.S. government securities."

As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
$85.6 million. We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this offering along
with our other capital resources, to fund ongoing development of our product
candidates, including ADS-5102, for commercialization activities related to any
wholly owned approved product, including developing a specialized CNS sales
force, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We
currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

.  approximately $30 million to fund our Phase 3 registration trial of ADS-5102
   in LID and related activities;

.  approximately $30 million to fund a Phase 2/3 study of ADS-5102 in a second 
   CNS indication and related activities;

.  approximately $30 million to fund additional product development, including 
   clinical trials; and

.  the remainder for working capital, capital expenditures and other general 
   corporate purposes, which may include acquiring or licensing products, 
   businesses or technologies, although we have no present commitments for any 
   such acquisitions or licenses.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash 
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans

net proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest
the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our 
existing cash and cash equivalents described above, we expect that such funds
will be sufficient to enable us to fund the development of ADS-5102 through
commercialization in its first indication. However, it is possible that we will
not achieve the progress that we expect because the actual costs and timing of
drug development, particularly clinical studies, are difficult to predict,
subject to substantial risks and delays and often vary depending on the
particular indication and development strategy. We do not expect that the net
proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to enable us to fund substantial development of our other product
candidates."

We intend to use such net proceeds for the following purposes:

. Approximately $10.5 million to acquire AirPatrol Corporation, a developer of
  mobile device identification and locating systems, including approximately
  $500,000 allocated for fees and expenses incurred and to be incurred in
  connection with said acquisition. The Company has entered into an Agreement

  Corporation in the mobile cyber-security and location-based services (LBS)
  space with leading-edge solutions and proprietary intellectual property.

  technologies for mobile devices operating on WiFi, cellular and wideband RF

. Approximately $2.0 million to hire sales and marketing personnel for our 
  Sysorex and Lilien subsidiaries and to expand our Washington, D.C. office for
  Sysorex Government Services.

. Approximately $4.0 million to fund in whole or in part, strategic acquisitions
  for which we currently do not have any agreements or understandings.

. The remaining net proceeds will be used for working capital and general
  corporate purposes.

The allocation of net proceeds to the Company from this Offering set forth above
represents the Company’s current intentions. This allocation is based upon our
present plans, and certain assumptions regarding current economic and industry
conditions and the Company’s future prospects. In the event the acquisition of
AirPatrol Corporation cannot be completed, the Company will seek out other
potential acquisitions consistent with its business strategy. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including
market conditions, results from our research and development efforts, business
developments and opportunities and related rate of growth, sales and marketing
activities and competition. Accordingly, our management will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying
on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds from
this Offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the
proceeds from this Offering for other purposes. From time to time, we evaluate
these purposes and other factors and we anticipate continuing to make such
evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of resources, including the

approximately US$95.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. In addition, we
expect to receive net proceeds of approximately US$37.2 million from the
concurrent private placement of Class A common shares to Best Investment
Corporation. If the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option to
purchase additional ADSs, we will receive approximately US$116.4 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering primarily for
the following purposes:

.  70%, or approximately US$66.6 million to finance potential strategic      
   acquisitions and construction of new medical centers in China;            

.  15%, or approximately US$14.3 million to finance potential strategic      
   acquisitions and construction of dental clinics in China;                 

.  5%, or approximately US$4.7 million to upgrade our information technology 
   systems; and

   other general corporate purposes.                                     

In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, under
PRC laws and regulations, we are permitted to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, we
may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiaries or make additional
capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures
or working capital. We intend to invest the proceeds of this offering into our
PRC subsidiaries and thereafter convert such proceeds into Renminbi promptly
upon completion of relevant PRC government registration or receipt of the
relevant approval. If we provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries through capital
contributions or loans, we will need to increase our PRC subsidiaries’ approved
registered capital and total investment amount, which requires approval from the
MOFCOM or its local branches. This approval process typically takes 30 to 90
days, and sometimes longer, from the time the MOFCOM or its local branches
receive all the required application documents. If we provide funding to a PRC
subsidiary through loans, we will also need to register such loans with SAFE or
its local branches, which usually requires no more than 20 working days from the
date of receipt of all the required application documents by SAFE or its local
branches. We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete these government
registrations or obtain the relevant approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments or bank deposits.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and
allocation of the net proceeds to us from this offering based upon our present
plans and business conditions, but our management will have significant
flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The
occurrence of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in
application of our proceeds from this offering in a manner other than as
described in this prospectus.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders."

We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering to fund
the redemption of the 12.5% Senior Notes and Senior PIK Notes. We will also use
the U.S. dollar equivalent of $500.0 million of borrowings under the New Term
Loans, $148 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
approximately $400 million of cash on our balance sheet to (i) fund the
redemption of the 12.5% Senior Notes and Senior PIK Notes and pay related fees

holders of outstanding Phantom SARs, (iii) pay a one-time fee to terminate our
management services agreement with the Sponsors of $72 million and (iv) pay fees

Healthcare Technology Intermediate, Inc. is required to pay interest entirely in
cash at a rate of 7.375% per annum on the Senior PIK Notes, unless certain
conditions are satisfied, in which case it is entitled to pay interest on the
Senior PIK Notes by increasing the principal amount of such notes or by issuing
new notes (the issuance or interest, referred to herein as the “PIK Interest”).
PIK Interest on the Senior PIK Notes accrues at a rate of 8.125% per annum

Notes mature on September 1, 2018. The Senior PIK Notes were issued on August 6,

fees and expenses.

The 12.5% Senior Notes accrue cash interest at the rate of 12.5% per year and
IMS Health is required to pay interest entirely in cash. The 12.5% Senior Notes
mature on March 1, 2018.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders, including if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares. After deducting the underwriting discounts, the selling
stockholders will receive approximately $248 million of proceeds from this
offering.

Dividends declared in the year preceding an initial public offering are deemed
to be in contemplation of the offering with the intention of repayment out of
the offering proceeds to the extent that dividends exceeded earnings during such
period. We have provided pro forma earnings per share information for 2013 that
gives pro forma effect to the assumed issuance of a number of shares whose
proceeds are deemed to be necessary to pay previous year’s dividends in excess
of 2013 earnings ($671 million), as well as adjustments to give pro forma effect
to the Refinancing and settlement of Phantom SARs.

Certain affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co., an underwriter of this offering,
hold a portion of our 12.5% Senior Notes, and it is expected that as a result of
the Refinancing, they will receive more than 5% of the net proceeds of the
offering. In addition, affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC, an underwriter of this
offering, own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock.

As a result of the foregoing relationships, each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and TPG
Capital BD, LLC is deemed to have a “conflict of interest” within the meaning of
FINRA Rule 5121, and this offering will be conducted in accordance with such
rule. FINRA Rule 5121 requires that neither Goldman, Sachs & Co. nor TPG Capital
BD, LLC make sales to discretionary accounts without the prior written approval
of the account holder and that a qualified independent underwriter (“QIU”), as
defined in FINRA Rule 5121, participate in the preparation of the registration
statement of which this prospectus forms a part and exercise its usual standards
of due diligence with respect thereto. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has agreed to
act as QIU for this offering. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC will not receive any
additional fees for serving as QIU in connection with this offering. We have
agreed to indemnify J.P. Morgan Securities LLC against certain liabilities
incurred in connection with acting as QIU, including liabilities under the
Securities Act or contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required
to make in that respect."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters' overallotment option is exercised in full, we
estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $56.8 million.

We intend to use approximately $31 million of the proceeds from this offering 
to fund an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Twirla, our lead product 
candidate.

We intend to use the remainder of the proceeds as follows:

.  approximately $2 to $4 million for the completion of the equipment
   qualification and validation related to the expansion of Corium's
   manufacturing capabilities;

.  approximately $2 to $4 million for the development of our product candidate 
   pipeline, including Twirla line extensions; and

.  the remainder of the net proceeds for making scheduled principal and interest
   payments beginning in February 2015 on our outstanding term loan with Oxford 
   Finance, LLC and for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of
the particular uses of the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of
this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on
numerous factors, including the implementation of our manufacturing strategy,
the status of our product candidate development efforts, our sales and marketing
activities, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, and
competition. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of
our management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering.

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above purposes, we intend
to invest the funds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
securities. We cannot predict whether these investments will yield a favorable
return."

the sale of 7,200,000 ordinary shares to Samsung Fine Chemicals in connection
with the Samsung Private Placements, after deducting commissions.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes
and in the following amounts:

• approximately $0.1 million will be used to provide a portion of the cash 
  necessary to repay in full the intercompany notes issued to SunEdison in 
  connection with the asset transfers contemplated as part of the Formation

deducting issuance costs from borrowings under our new senior secured term loan

(1) In connection with the Financing Transactions, we will enter into new senior 
    secured credit facilities that will include a senior secured revolving credit
    facility for borrowings of up to $50.0 million. We do not expect to have any 
    outstanding borrowings under this senior secured revolving credit facility   
    upon completion of this offering. We currently do not have commitments from  
    any prospective lenders with respect to the new senior secured credit        
    facilities but will obtain such commitments prior to the completion of this  
    offering.

    the Samsung Private Placements.                                              

(3) We will use approximately $0.6 million of the net proceeds from this         
    offering, together with $202.1 million of net proceeds after deducting       
    issuance costs from borrowings under our new senior secured term loan and    
    $87.3 million of net proceeds after deducting private placement commissions  
    from the cash investment by Samsung Fine Chemicals in connection with the    
    Samsung Private Placements, to fund the cash payment to SunEdison to repay in
    full the intercompany notes. The cash repayment of the notes and the 23.6    
    million ordinary shares to be issued to SunEdison, together with the         
    assumption by SSL of $336.0 million of liabilities reflected on our balance  
    sheet as of March 31, 2014 (to the extent not subsequently discharged) plus  
    all other liabilities related to the semiconductor materials business,       
    represent the consideration paid to SunEdison in exchange for the assets of  
    its semiconductor materials business contributed to SSL.                     

(4) Consists of long-term notes bearing a fixed interest rate of 2.2% owed to the
    Development Bank of Japan Inc. by our Japanese subsidiary, MEMC Japan Ltd.   
    The notes mature at various times between 2014 and 2017, and the aggregate   
    outstanding principal amount of the notes was $10.6 million as of March 31,  
    2014. We expect this amount as of the anticipated closing date of this       
    offering will be approximately $11.1 million due to accrued interest,        
    prepayments and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.                  

(5) We may use such net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate 
    purposes. The actual amount of cash that will be retained by us will vary    
    from what is set forth in the table above based on changes in the actual     
    amount of the intercompany notes as of the closing date of this offering.    

(6) The estimated fees and expenses include underwriting discounts and           
    commissions, the unamortized original issuance discount on our new senior    
    secured term loan and our estimated legal, accounting and other expenses     
    associated with the Transactions."

from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated 
offering expenses payable by us and net proceeds of approximately US$1,309 
million from the concurrent private placement to Huang River Investment Limited,
after deducting the placement fee payable by us. If the underwriters exercise 
their over-allotment option in full and Huang River Investment Limited exercises
its option to further subscribe to Class A ordinary shares to maintain the 5% 
proportionate size of the concurrent private placement, these numbers would 
increase to US$1,504 million and US$1,323 million, respectively.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital.

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private 
placement as follows:

.  approximately US$1.0 billion to US$1.2 billion over the next three years to 
   expand our fulfillment infrastructure by acquiring land use rights, building 
   new warehouses and purchasing vehicles for shipping and delivery; and

.  the balance for general corporate purposes, including funding potential 
   investments and acquisitions of complementary businesses, assets and 
   technologies.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. 
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus. 

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and 
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiaries in China only through loans or capital contributions
and to other subsidiaries in China and our consolidated variable interest
entities only through loans, subject to the approval of government authorities
and limit on the amount of capital contributions and loans. Subject to
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, we
may extend inter-company loans to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China
or make additional capital contributions to these subsidiaries to fund their
capital expenditures or working capital. For an increase of registered capital
of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries, we need to obtain approval from the
Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts, which will decide within 90 days
after receiving the application. If we provide funding to any of our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiaries through loans, the total amount of such loans may not
exceed the difference between the entity's total investment as approved by the
foreign investment authorities and its registered capital. Such loans must be
registered with SAFE or its local branches, which usually takes up to 20 working
days to complete. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling 
shareholders."

estimated placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering to:

• Expand our turnkey design and installation contracting services business in our
  core markets in the Northeast United States and California. Proceeds will be   
  used for additional sales and technical staff to support the business and for  
  working capital to complete these projects. We anticipate expanding our service
  and turnkey operations to new territories, which will likewise require startup 
  capital.                                                                       

• Further expand our business into foreign markets.

• Expand our low-emissions technology business to other markets, including       
  applying our emissions technology to non-Tecogen engines in a wider range of   
  industrial markets.

The remainder of the net proceeds from this offering may be used for working
capital and general corporate purposes.

If we receive substantially less than the maximum proceeds from this offering,
we believe that we will have access to other funding sources that, together with
the proceeds we do receive, will be sufficient to meet our working capital
requirements for at least the next twelve months.

The actual amount we spend for such purposes will depend on then-existing
conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, business
prospects, and other factors that we may deem relevant. Accordingly, our
management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we 
intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation 
investments, including short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
instruments, and U.S. government securities.

We have no current understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to
any material acquisition of or investment in any technologies, products, or

flexibility, improve brand awareness, create a public market for our common
stock and facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We
currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily for
general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and
capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire

of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the cash
used in or generated by our operations, the pace of our expansion plans, and our
investments and acquisitions.

from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these 
proceeds. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from the offering for general corporate

providing equity capital to the Bank to fund balance sheet growth or working 
capital needs, our working capital needs, and funding acquisitions of branches,

upon the initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions of $7.0 million and estimated offering
expenses of $3.5 million payable by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares from us is exercised in full, we estimate that our net
proceeds would be approximately $103.4 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and facilitate our
future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use the net proceeds

corporate purposes, including the expansion of our sales organization,
international expansion, further development of our customer service platform

a portion of the net proceeds to:

• satisfy the anticipated tax withholding and remittance obligations related
  to the initial settlement of our outstanding restricted stock units, which
  we expect to be approximately $0.5 million, based on the number of        
  restricted stock units for which service conditions have been satisfied as
  of March 31, 2014 and the initial public offering price of $9.00 per      
  share;                                                                    

• satisfy all or a portion of anticipated tax withholding and remittance

  stock at the time of settlement;                                          

• repay all or some of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the
  equipment line of credit or the revolving line of credit under our        
  existing credit facility with our lender; and                             

• acquire complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies.

We also expect to contribute up to 1% of the net proceeds of this offering to
the financial support of our global corporate responsibilities objectives. Among
other matters, this may include the establishment and funding of a foundation to
manage these efforts. We expect that we will continue to use a portion of our
available capital to support these efforts on an ongoing basis.

As of March 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on our equipment line of credit
was $7.7 million and such amount bore interest at a rate of 2.5% per annum. The
outstanding balance under our equipment line of credit as of September 14, 2014
is payable in equal monthly installments for 30 months thereafter, with the last
payment due on March 14, 2017. As of March 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on
our revolving line of credit was $20.0 million and such amount bore interest at
the prime rate plus 2.0% per annum. If the net cash proceeds from this offering
are at least $100.0 million, the interest rate will be reduced to the prime rate
upon the consummation of this offering. The outstanding balance under our
revolving line of credit is due on January 1, 2016.

The amount and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds that we will receive
from this offering will depend on numerous factors, including the cash used in
or generated by our operations, the activities of our sales organization, the
level of our international expansion efforts, the results of our product
development efforts, and our technology acquisitions. Our management has
discretion over many of these factors. Therefore, except as specified above, we
are unable estimate the amount of the net proceeds from this offering that will
be used for any of the purposes described above. Accordingly, we will have broad
discretion in using these proceeds. Pending the use of proceeds from this
offering as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive
in this offering in short-term and intermediate-term interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade investments, certificates of deposit, or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

over-allotment option to purchase additional shares, we estimate that our net
proceeds will be approximately $83.1 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $23.2 million. We
currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $37.0 million for our planned Phase 2b dose-ranging trial of 
  our monoclonal antibody, ALD403, targeting CGRP for prevention of migraine; 

. approximately $5.5 million for preclinical product development activities; 
  and 

. the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which 
  may include the acquisition or licensing of other products, businesses or 
  technologies. 

The expected uses of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
and cash equivalents represent our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts and the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering. We have no current understandings, agreements or
commitments for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products,
businesses or technologies.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents described above, we expect that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to complete a Phase 2b dose-ranging trial of ALD403.
However, we may not achieve the progress that we expect because the actual costs
and timing of drug development, particularly clinical trials, are difficult to
predict, subject to substantial risks and delays and often vary depending on the
particular disease and development strategy.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds with a view toward liquidity and capital preservation."

plus a margin and the applicable tranche matures in May 2019. At December 31,
2013, the three-month LIBOR plus applicable spread on the senior secured loan
facility was 2.50%. GAS-five Ltd. and GAS-six Ltd. (a subsidiary of GasLog but
an entity which will not be contributed to the Partnership), jointly and
severally entered into the $277 million senior secured credit facility to fund
the installment payments on the construction of the GasLog Sydney and the GasLog
Skagen (the vessel owned by GAS-six Ltd.), which we refer to as the GasLog
Sydney facility. We have entered into amended facility agreements dividing the
GasLog Sydney facility into two separate facilities on substantially the same
terms as the current facility, with one facility executed by GAS-five Ltd. for
the portion allocated to the GasLog Sydney and one facility executed by GAS-six
Ltd. for the portion allocated to the GasLog Skagen. Borrowings under these
facilities were used to finance the construction of the vessels in our initial
fleet.

An affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is a lender under the senior
secured loan facility related to the GasLog Sydney and will receive a portion of
the proceeds of this offering. Accordingly, this offering is being made in
compliance with Rule 5121 of FINRA. 

We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,260,000
additional common units. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, we will use the net proceeds (approximately $24.67
million, if exercised in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions) to make a payment to GasLog. If the underwriters do not exercise
their option to purchase additional common units, we will issue common units to
GasLog at the expiration of the option period. If and to the extent the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units, the
number of units purchased by the underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be
issued to the public and the remainder, if any, will be issued to GasLog.
Accordingly, the exercise of the underwriters’ option will not affect the total
number of units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum
quarterly distribution on all units."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $55.1 million, or
approximately $63.8 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, based on the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
$1.4 million. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with our cash and cash equivalents as follows:

.  approximately $30.0 million for clinical and preclinical costs associated  
   with the completion of Phase 2 and the initiation of Phase 3 trials for our
   lead product candidate SCY-078;                                            

.  $15.0 million to pay down our $15.0 million credit facility with HSBC; and

.  the balance to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general
   corporate purposes.                                                        

Our $15.0 million credit facility agreement with HSBC becomes due on
December 31, 2014, and bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.95% per annum.
This credit facility is guaranteed by Sanofi, a related party. Sanofi expressed
an interest in investing $15.0 million in this offering, which amount will be
used concurrently with the completion of this offering to pay down the credit
facility in full. 

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts and the status of and results from
clinical studies, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with
third parties and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $56.4 million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses
payable by us in connection with this offering. The underwriters may also
purchase up to a maximum of 874,999 additional shares of common stock from the
selling stockholders named in this prospectus to cover over-allotments. If the
underwriters exercise their right to purchase such additional shares of common
stock from the selling stockholders, which include entities affiliated with
members of our Board and certain of our executive officers, we will not receive
any proceeds from such sale.

We intend to use net proceeds from this offering to repay $54.9 million in
aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our new senior secured credit
facilities and to pay a $1.5 million termination fee associated with our
advisory services and monitoring agreement with Lee Equity. Our new senior
secured credit facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate of LIBOR
plus 5.75%, as calculated pursuant to the agreement governing our new senior
secured credit facilities, and mature on October 25, 2018. We entered into the 
new senior secured credit facilities in October 2013 and used the proceeds to 
repay our then existing credit facilities, to make a $31.5 million payment to 
holders of our Preferred Shares and to fund investments."

price of $8.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’
option to purchase additional shares in this offering is exercised in full, we
estimate our net proceeds will be approximately $11.5 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, create a public market for our common stock, facilitate
our future access to the public equity markets and increase our visibility in
our markets. We intend to use approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds of
this offering for research and development activities for NS2, including our
currently planned clinical trials of NS2 and development of other molecules that
may relate to our aldehyde trapping platform, and the remainder for working
capital and other general corporate purposes. We believe that our anticipated
research and development expenditures will be sufficient to complete the two
clinical trials described in this prospectus, and we believe that each clinical
trial will require between $1.0 million to $2.0 million to complete. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in
complementary businesses or products; however, we have no current commitments or
obligations to do so. Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities or certificates of deposit.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through at least the next two years, although we cannot assure you
that this will occur.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and other development
efforts for NS2 and related drug candidates, as well as the amount of cash used
in our operations. We therefore cannot estimate the actual amount of net
proceeds to be used for the purposes described above. We may find it necessary
or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying
on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds
from this offering."

(1)    A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
       FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
       portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we        
       received from Brasilinvest International LLC described below. These funds    
       will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.         

(2)    No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the 
       private units.                                                               

(3)    The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $475,000    
       even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income earned 
       on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such
       interest income) of up to $500,000 will be available to us to pay for our    
       working capital requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust   
       account will be approximately $125,000 over a 24-month period assuming an    
       interest rate of approximately 0.05% per year.                               

(4)    These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these   
       items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may    
       incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in    
       connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
       based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not   
       anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
       fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
       fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
       category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     

An affiliate of Mario Garnero and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) have
committed to purchase an aggregate of 563,750 private units at a price of $10.00
per unit ($5,637,500 in the aggregate) in a private placement that will occur
simultaneously with the closing of this offering. This affiliate and
EarlyBirdCapital have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised
by the underwriters, they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 70,313 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least
$10.05 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless
of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. All of the
proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account
described below.

$125,625,000, or $144,468,750 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at Barclays in the United States, maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held
in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury bills, bonds
or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States government
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other
tax obligations and (ii) up to $500,000 of any remaining interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working
capital requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Brasilinvest Group, an affiliate of Mario Garnero, our Chief
Executive Officer, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. This
arrangement is being agreed to by Brasilinvest Group for our benefit and is not
intended to provide Mr. Garnero compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in Sao Paulo, Brazil, that the fee
charged by Brasilinvest Group is at least as favorable as we could have obtained
from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of
a business combination or our liquidation.

Other than the $10,000 monthly administrative fee, no compensation of any kind
(including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of
our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the
consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$475,000. In addition, up to $500,000 of interest earned on the funds held in
the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for a
business combination. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance 
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, 
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business 
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and 
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We 
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust 
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. We intend 
to use the after-tax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying
fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for
director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held
in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses 
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, 
as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our 
initial shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities 
on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to
EarlyBirdCapital of $4,600,000 (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which
might become payable) upon consummation of our initial business combination for
assisting us in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent
that our share capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect 
a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not 
used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined 
company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as 
working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working
capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or 
expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for 
marketing, research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Mario Garnero has agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of February 18, 2014, Brasilinvest International LLC loaned to us an
aggregate of $125,000 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA
filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion
of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan is payable without interest
on the earlier of (i) February 18, 2015, (ii) the date on which we consummate
our initial public offering or (iii) the date on which we determine to not
proceed with our initial public offering. The loan will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our initial shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but
are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon 
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at 
a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders 
being issued 55,000 ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted 
since the 50,000 rights included in the private units would result in
the issuance of 5,000 shares upon the closing of our business combination, as
well as 50,000 warrants to purchase 25,000 shares). Our shareholders have
approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities upon conversion of
such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of
the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete our
initial business combination, the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such shares in
connection with a business combination which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

the 8,900,000 shares of Class A common stock that we are selling in this
offering, based on the initial public offering price of $24.00 per share and
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. We will also receive proceeds of $1.7 million
from the exercise of stock options by certain selling stockholders in connection
with this offering. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of
our Class A common stock by the selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to repay our term loan under our
credit facility, for general corporate purposes including working capital, to
create a public market for our Class A common stock and to facilitate our future
access to the public equity markets. At March 31, 2014, the outstanding balance
of the term loan was $111.0 million and bore interest at the rate of 2.75% per
annum. The term loan has scheduled quarterly principal repayments with the
remaining balance due on December 21, 2015. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary businesses, technologies or assets. However, we have no present
commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or make any
investments.

Following the repayment of our term loan, our management will have significant
flexibility in applying the remaining net proceeds from this offering, and
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of these net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. The goal with respect to the
investment of these net proceeds will be capital preservation and liquidity so
that these funds are readily available to fund our operations."

price per share of $22.00, after deducting underwriting discounts and

approximately $7.3 million, including approximately $2.3 million in initial
public offering bonuses to certain members of management.

We intend to use all $93.0 million of these proceeds to purchase newly-issued 
LLC Units from Adeptus Health LLC.

Prior to the offering, we will draw on the Senior Secured Credit Facility to
fund a dividend of $60.0 million to the Existing Owners to be paid in connection
with the consummation of this offering. We intend to cause Adeptus Health LLC to
use the net proceeds to us from this offering to repay some or all of the then
outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facility (with such
facility remaining outstanding after such repayment and amounts repaid available
for re-borrowing to fund the construction of new facilities, purchase new
medical equipment and for general corporate purposes). Any remaining proceeds
will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital to
support our facility expansion efforts. The amounts currently outstanding under
the Senior Secured Credit Facility were utilized to repay preexisting
indebtedness, construct new facilities and support our working capital needs in
relation to our growth efforts. As of March 31, 2014, we had approximately
$82.0 million outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, excluding
letters of credit and guarantees, with a weighted average interest rate of 8.5%.
The Senior Secured Credit Facility matures on October 31, 2018.

termination of the Advisory Services Agreement. Pursuant to the Advisory
Services Agreement, which we entered into with SFM on September 30, 2011, SFM
has provided management, consulting and financial services to us and our
subsidiaries. The Advisory Services Agreement has a five-year term and is
automatically renewable for successive one-year periods, until such time that
our Sponsor or any of its affiliates, in the aggregate, no longer beneficially
own greater than 10% of the then-outstanding voting securities of First Choice
ER, LLC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the consummation of
this offering, the Advisory Services Agreement will be terminated.

purchase, for cash, an aggregate of 421,414 outstanding LLC Units from certain
of the Existing Owners at a purchase price per unit equal to the initial public
offering price per share of Class A common stock in this offering net of
underwriting discounts and commissions. The remaining 313,586 shares of Class A

allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds. As of the date of this prospectus, we
cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to
be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will
actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual
use of proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors, including the factors.
For example, management may determine that market conditions warrant slowing 
or accelerating the expansion of our 3D printing service center capacity 
and/or the increase or decrease of our sales and marketing efforts in certain 
regions or segments. Management may also discontinue certain research and 
development activities in the event where management were to conclude that 
such activities are unlikely to reach the desired results within the foreseen 
budgets or timing. Also, the occurrence of unforeseen events or business 
opportunities could result in our management deciding not to allocate the 
funds entirely as currently anticipated. In the event where funds would not 
be fully allocated to certain of the currently foreseen purposes, then we 
currently expect that these funds will be used for general corporate purposes.
Pending our use of the net proceeds as described above, we may invest the net 
proceeds in short-term bank deposits or invest them in interest-bearing,

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and
the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will
have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an
unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds
of this offering differently than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws
and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries and variable interest
entities only through loans or capital contributions, and only if we satisfy the
applicable government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to meet these requirements on a timely basis, if at
all. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities."

(1)  Includes $40.0 million that was drawn under our revolving credit facility
     subsequent to March 31, 2014 to finance our capital expenditure plan.

As of March 31, 2014, we had $20.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our
revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility matures on January 15,
2018, and interest on outstanding borrowings accrue based on, at our option,
LIBOR or the alternate base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin that
is determined based on our utilization of commitments under our revolving credit
facility. The interest rate with respect to outstanding borrowings under our
revolving credit facility was 1.99% as of March 31, 2014. The borrowings to be
repaid were incurred primarily for our drilling and development program and for
general corporate purposes. As of May 1, 2014, our borrowing base was increased
to $100.0 million, of which $60.0 million was drawn. While we currently do not
have plans to immediately borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit
facility following the closing of this offering, we may at any time re-borrow
amounts repaid under our revolving credit facility, and we expect to do so to
fund our capital program.

The selling stockholders have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to
purchase up to an aggregate of 4,545,000 additional shares of our common stock
to the extent the underwriters sell more than 30,300,000 shares of common stock
in this offering. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by
the selling stockholders pursuant to any exercise by the underwriters of their
option to purchase additional shares of our common stock from the selling
stockholders. We will pay all expenses of the selling stockholders related to
this offering, other than underwriting discounts and commissions related to the
shares sold by the selling stockholders.

Certain affiliates of the EnCap Funds and certain of our executive officers may
indirectly receive proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders
as a result of a distribution of proceeds by the selling stockholders to their
respective limited partners, as applicable. 

Affiliates of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley

(or approximately $134.3 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common
stock offered by us in this offering, based on the initial public offering price
of $17.00 per share, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes:

. $16.0 million to fund the planned Phase 1-2 single-arm multicenter        
  clinical trial of KTE-C19 in patients with DLBCL who have failed two or   
  more lines of therapy;

. $30.0 million to fund additional trials for other indications for KTE-C19;

. $20.0 million to fund the advancement of any additional product candidates
  that we select;

. $15.0 million to expand our internal research and development capabilities
  to explore the next generation of eACT technology and new product candidates; 
  and

. the balance to fund working capital, including general operating expenses.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire,
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.
However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the ongoing status and results of NCI’s Phase 1-2a clinical
trial for anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy and of NCI’s other clinical trials of
CAR- and TCR-based therapies. Although it is difficult to predict future
liquidity requirements, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering and
our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be
sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 36 months, which we
expect will be through the completion of our planned Phase 1-2 single-arm
multicenter clinical trial of KTE-C19 and our randomized clinical trial of
KTE-C19. We anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding for the
development of any additional product candidates we choose to develop.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to access to additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs
and whether we are able to enter into future licensing arrangements. As a
result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might decide
to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or preclinical activities if the net
proceeds from this offering and any other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that net proceeds will be
approximately $60.8 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million to fund continued discovery and 
  development efforts for our preclinical product candidates; 
 
. if we exercise our right to co-fund the first Phase 3 clinical development 
  program for tenapanor, we may invest a portion of the net proceeds of this

  respectively, in the royalties payable to us by AstraZeneca on net sales of 
  tenapanor; 
 
. approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million to advance and expand the 
  development of APECCS, which amount is expected to fund our planned 
  development activities for at least two years including acquiring equipment 
  to monitor, miniaturize and automate the APECCS cell culture and screening 
  processes, and enhancing the capabilities to develop intestinal cells in the 
  APECCS format, APECCS cultures from intestinal tissues and assays with the 
  APECCS system; and 
 
. the remainder for working capital and other corporate purposes, which will 
  include facilities expansion and the pursuit of other research and discovery 
  efforts and could include the acquisition or in-license of other products, 
  product candidates or technologies.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and
regulatory approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the
exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the
above purposes. As such, our management will retain discretion over the use of
the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures
will depend upon numerous factors, including, among others:

. the timing of the results of our ongoing Phase 2a and 2b clinical trials for 
  tenapanor;

. the receipt, if any, of milestone payments from one or more of our 
  collaboration partners;

. whether we exercise our right to co-fund the Phase 3 clinical development 
  program for tenapanor and at what financial level; 

. whether we exercise our right to co-promote tenapanor and/or a NaP2b 
  inhibitor under our agreements with our collaboration partners; 
 
. the size, scope and timing of any nonclinical or clinical trials that we may 
  decide to pursue; and 
 
. the number and scope of any discovery programs and research and development

. approximately $30 million of the net proceeds we receive from this offering 
  to fund the additional expenditures necessary for the design, development 
  and construction of our third production line in East Providence; 

. approximately $1.0 million of the net proceeds to repay any amounts 
  outstanding under our revolving line of credit, which matures on July 27, 
  2014 and bears interest at the greater of the prime rate or 4% (which at 
  March 31, 2014 was 4% per annum and which is also the weighted average rate), 
  plus 1.0% per annum, and approximately $19.0 million of the net proceeds to 
  repay our subordinated notes due September 2014, which bear interest at a 
  rate of 20% per annum; and 

. the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which will 
  include funding a portion of the design, development and construction of 
  our planned second production plant in Europe or Asia after completion of 
  our third production line. 

We anticipate initial operation of a first production line at this second
production plant during 2017. Based on our preliminary plans for this plant, our
projected cost to construct an initial production line and plant infrastructure
is $80 million to $100 million, of which we expect approximately $20 million to
$25 million to be funded by the net proceeds of this offering. We expect that
the remaining $55 million to $80 million required to construct an initial
production line and plant infrastructure will be funded by anticipated cash
flows from operations, local government grants, debt financings and potentially
equity financings."

offering expenses to repay all amounts outstanding under its senior secured
credit facility, to fund a debt service reserve account for the payment of
interest on the PIK notes, to pay a distribution to the Funds and for general
company purposes. In connection with the closing of this offering, we will enter
into a new revolving credit facility and use a portion of the borrowings under
that agreement to repay outstanding borrowings under WildHorse Resources’ credit
agreements, which will be terminated upon repayment. Borrowings under WildHorse

      and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, which we expect will
      be 30 days after the closing of this offering. Until such redemption date or
      any earlier discharge date, we will use the amount to be paid to the holders
      of the PIK notes to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under our new    
      revolving credit facility.                                                  

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by
MRD Holdco, including pursuant to any exercise by the underwriters of their
option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. MRD Holdco is deemed
under federal securities laws to be an underwriter with respect to the common
stock it may sell in connection with this offering.

The PIK notes bear interest at the rate of 10.00% per annum if paid in cash and
10.75% per annum if paid as PIK interest and mature on December 15, 2018. MRD
LLC used the net proceeds from the offering of the PIK notes after paying
offering expenses to repay all amounts outstanding under its senior secured
credit facility, to fund a debt service reserve account for the payment of
interest on the PIK notes, to pay a distribution to the Funds and for general
company purposes. In connection with the closing of this offering, we will enter
into a new revolving credit facility and use a portion of the borrowings under
that agreement to repay outstanding borrowings under WildHorse Resources’ credit
agreements, which will be terminated upon repayment. Borrowings under WildHorse
Resources’ credit agreements were used to acquire assets, to make capital
expenditures and for other general corporate purposes."

approximately $89.2 million, based on the initial public offering price of $9.00
per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock and thereby enable access to the public equity markets by our
employees and stockholders, obtain additional capital and increase our
visibility in the marketplace. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from
this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working
capital and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds
for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses
that complement our business, although we have no present commitments or
agreements to enter into any acquisitions or investments. Pending these uses, we
plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing obligations,
investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the United States. The goal with respect to the investment of
these net proceeds is capital preservation and liquidity so that such funds are
readily available to fund our operations.

We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to redeem $132.5 million in
aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our 8.750% Senior Secured Notes
due 2019 at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date. The remaining proceeds
will be used to pay fees and expenses associated with this offering and for

We intend to use approximately $81.2 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering towards the purchase of our Newbuilding PSVs. We may use the balance 
of the net proceeds for the construction of the LOI PSVs and for other 
acquisitions and general corporate purposes including working capital.

We expect that the purchase price of the LOI PSVs will be approximately $43.6 
million each. Other than the potential use of the balance of the net proceeds 
of $5.8 million from this offering, and a portion of operating cash flow, we
plan to finance the acquisition of the LOI PSVs with borrowings under our 
Credit Facility, an increase in the capacity of our Credit Facility and 
possibly through equity offerings or other transactions in the capital markets.

We have agreed to pay NAT a success fee in the amount of $1.5 million, for 
distribution to its management team and other employees contingent on the 
listing of our shares on the NYSE."

approximately US$66.7 million, or approximately US$77.2 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us and (ii) net proceeds of approximately US$14.1 million from the
Concurrent Private Placement after deducting estimated fees and expenses payable
by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives in a listed company and obtain additional
capital. We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent
Private Placement for our geographic expansion, product development, upgrade of
our information technology system and website, and working capital and general
corporate purposes, including strategic investments and potential acquisition
opportunities. We may also use the net proceeds from this offering and the
Concurrent Private Placement to repay part or all of our existing bank loans
incurred for the repurchase of Series E preferred shares from Macquarie Zhaopin
Holdings Limited with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately
RMB420 million (US$67.6 million) as of the date of this prospectus, although we
have not determined the exact amount of the proceeds that will be used for loan
repayment. The interest rates of these loans range from 1% above one month LIBOR
per annum to 2.95% above three-month LIBOR per annum and the maturity dates of
these facilities range from April 2015 to April 2016.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering.
However, we will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply the net
proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions
change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as described
in this prospectus. To the extent that a certain portion or all of the net
proceeds we receive from this offering are not immediately applied for the above
purposes, we plan to invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing debt
instruments or bank deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement, as
an offshore holding company, we are permitted under the PRC laws and regulations
to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital
contributions and to our PRC affiliated entities only through loans, subject to
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements.
There are no costs associated with registering loans or capital contributions
with relevant PRC authorities, other than nominal processing charges. Under PRC
laws and regulations, the PRC governmental authorities are required to grant
approvals and complete registrations or deny our application within 90 days for
capital contributions, although the actual time taken may be longer due to
administrative delay. PRC laws and regulations do not provide an explicit
timeline for approvals or registrations of loans to PRC subsidiaries or
affiliated entities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We are
prohibited from converting registered capital in foreign exchange into Renminbi
for the purpose of domestic equity investment, granting certain entrusted loans,
repayment of inter-company loans, and repayment of bank loans which have been
transferred to a third party. Our ability to transfer capital to our
consolidated affiliated entities through our PRC subsidiaries, including our
joint venture, may be significantly restricted, which may adversely affect the
ability of our consolidated affiliated entities to expand their business
operations.

Our PRC subsidiaries can utilize the proceeds of this offering through
shareholder loans or capital contributions after obtaining approval from, and
completing registration with, the applicable PRC governmental authorities for
approved purposes specified in the business licenses of our PRC subsidiaries.
Therefore, our PRC subsidiaries can utilize the proceeds of this offering to
conduct product development, upgrade information technology system and provide 
services to our PRC affiliated entities, and our joint venture can utilize the 
proceeds of this offering to carry out geographic expansion by establishing 
new branch offices, which are permitted under their respective business 
licenses. However, our PRC subsidiaries’ licenses do not specifically authorize 
equity investments. As a result, none of our PRC subsidiaries is allowed to use 
such funds to make any equity investment in the PRC by means of establishing 
new subsidiaries or acquiring an equity interest in other entities in China. 
This limitation could adversely affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to 
expand their business operations and may impact our planned use of proceeds. 
For example, we may not be able to use our proceeds for strategic investment 
or acquisition in China through our PRC subsidiaries."

    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination   
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business   
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working        
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on   
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.                        

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect    
    approximately $80,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the     
    funds held in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This 
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current     
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In         
    addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an       
    intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our   
    sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated 
    to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business   
    combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the  
    trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out
    of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial      
    business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working    
    capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no  
    proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. 
    Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post 
    business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of
    the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement        
    warrants issued to the initial stockholder. The terms of such loans by our  
    sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors,
    if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with       
    respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other    
    than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third  
    parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any 
    and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.                

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $435,000,000 (or approximately $500,250,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$15,921,000 (or up to $18,309,150 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $80,000 per year, assuming an interest rate
of 0.02% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
taxes, if any, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business
combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable
to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering (subject to the requirements of law). Based on current interest rates,
we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to
pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, WL Ross Sponsor LLC, our sponsor, has
loaned us $350,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of
March 31, 2015 or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon
the closing of this offering out of the $900,000 of offering proceeds that has
been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the
trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of
funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the initial
stockholder. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have
not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an
affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to
loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access
to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

We have granted our sponsor the option to purchase, simultaneously with the
consummation of an initial business combination, up to an additional 10,000,000
shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share. The proceeds of the sale
of such shares will not be deposited into the trust account, the shares will not
be eligible for redemption from the trust account nor will they be eligible to
vote upon the initial business combination. Our sponsor may assign this option
to one or more of its affiliated investment funds to satisfy their co-investment
rights in our initial business combination. The definitive agreement relating to
the private placement will be entered into concurrently with the definitive
agreement for our initial business combination, and the closing of the private
placement purchase will occur immediately prior to the consummation of our
initial business combination. No commissions, fees or other compensation will be
payable in connection with the private placement.

Our initial stockholder has entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to
which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder
shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial
business combination. In addition, our initial stockholder has agreed to waive
its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
its founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, to create a public market for our stock and thereby
enable access to the public equity markets by our employees and stockholders, to

approximately $23.6 million of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to
prepay the principal and accrued interest of the Singtel Innov8 Pte. Ltd
subordinated convertible promissory note, and the remaining net proceeds for
general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing
activities, product development, general and administrative matters and capital
expenditures, although we do not currently have any specific or preliminary
plans with respect to the use of proceeds for such purposes. We also may use a
portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products,
services or technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for
any specific acquisitions at this time. We will have broad discretion over the
uses of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to
invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade
interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of
deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government as
