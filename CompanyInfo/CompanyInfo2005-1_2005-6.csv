     a February 2, 2005 redemption date.

sale of common shares by selling shareholders in this offering. If the
underwriters exercise their overallotment option, we will not receive any
additional proceeds.

      We intend to use the net proceeds from our sale of common shares in this
offering:

stock, facilitate our future access to public equity markets, enhance our
ability to incentivize our employees with equity-linked compensation programs
and provide increased visibility in a marketplace in which a number of our
current and potential competitors are or may become publicly-held companies. A
public market for our common stock will also facilitate our use of our common
stock as an acquisition currency, although currently we have no plans for
specific acquisitions.

     We currently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds from
this offering and anticipate that we will use such proceeds for general
corporate purposes. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from
this offering for acquisitions of complementary businesses, products and
technologies. Our management will have broad discretion over how we use the net
proceeds from this offering. Pending application of the use of the net proceeds

proceeds from the offering of our Series A common stock and the offering of our
preferred stock will be used to pay a portion of the $803 million (or
$917 million, if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full)
special Series B common stock dividends, in each case based on an initial public
offering price of $16.00 per share of Series A common stock. In addition,
$586 million of the proceeds from additional borrowings under the new senior
credit facilities will be used to fund the remaining portion of the special
Series B common stock dividends such that approximately $803 million, or 40%
($917 million, or 44%, if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option

Financings will be paid to the Original Stockholders.

using the net proceeds from the Concurrent Financings, as well as the use of
proceeds from such indebtedness, are described below:

the form of an increase in their accreted value. Cash interest payments will be
due and payable beginning on April 1, 2010.

    Senior Subordinated Notes.  In June and July 2004, BCP Caylux issued
$1,225 million aggregate principal amount of 95/8% U.S. Dollar-denominated
senior subordinated notes and 200 million principal amount of 103/8%
Euro-denominated senior subordinated notes. The senior subordinated notes mature
on June 15, 2014.

    Senior Credit Facilities.  In April 2004, BCP Caylux entered into senior
credit facilities with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led
by Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc., as global coordinator, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as joint lead arrangers, ABN AMRO Bank
N.V., Bank of America, N.A. and General Electric Capital Corporation, as
documentation agents, and Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG, Mizuho Corporate
Bank, Ltd., The Bank of Nova Scotia, KfW and Commerzbank AG, New York and Cayman
Branches, as senior managing agents. The senior credit facilities provide
financing of approximately $1.2 billion. The senior credit facilities consist of
(1) a term loan facility in the aggregate amount of $456 million and 125 million
with a maturity of seven years; (2) a $228 million credit-linked revolving
facility with a maturity of five years; and (3) a $380 million revolving credit
facility with a maturity of five years.

    We expect to increase the commitments under the revolving credit facilities
to $828 million under our new senior credit facilities. In addition, upon the
occurrence of certain events, BCP Crystal may request, prior to April 6, 2005,
an increase to the existing term loan facility in an amount not to exceed
$175 million in the aggregate, subject to receipt of commitments by existing
term loan lenders or other financial institutions reasonably acceptable to the
administrative agent.

    The borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear interest at a rate
equal to an applicable margin plus, at BCP Crystal's option, either (a) a base
rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the prime rate of Deutsche
Bank AG New York Branch and (2) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) a
LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the
currency of such borrowing for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for
certain additional costs. The applicable margin for borrowings under the
credit-linked revolving facility and the revolving credit facility is 1.50% with
respect to base rate borrowings and 2.50% with respect to LIBOR borrowings (in
each case subject to a step-down based on a performance test). The applicable
margin for borrowings under the term loan facility is 1.50% with respect to base
rate borrowings and 2.50% with respect to LIBOR borrowings (in each case subject
to a step-down based on a performance test). In addition to paying interest, BCP
Crystal is required to pay certain fees.

    Floating Rate Term Loan.  In June 2004, BCP Caylux entered into a
$350 million floating rate term loan with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as
administrative agent, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as global
coordinator, and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc., as joint lead arrangers. BCP Crystal is the borrower under the
floating rate term loan. The floating rate term loan has a maturity of seven and
one-half years and provides for no amortization of principal. The borrowings
under the floating rate term loan bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable
margin plus, at BCP Crystal's option, either (a) a base rate determined by
reference to the higher of (1) the prime rate of Deutsche Bank AG New York
Branch and (2) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) a LIBOR rate
determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of
such borrowing for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for
certain additional costs. The applicable margin for borrowings is (a) prior to
completion of the Recent Restructuring, 3.25% with respect to base rate
borrowings and 4.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings and (b) after completion
of the Recent Restructuring, 2.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and
3.50% with respect to LIBOR borrowings.

    Use of Proceeds From Indebtedness Being Discharged.  The Purchaser used the
borrowings under the existing senior credit facilities, together with the
borrowings under the senior subordinated bridge loan facilities, and the cash
equity investment by the Original Shareholders (which included the proceeds from
the issuance of the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares) to acquire Celanese
Shares in connection with the Tender Offer, to refinance certain existing debt
of Celanese, pre-fund certain pension obligations of Celanese, pre-fund certain
contingencies and certain obligations linked to the value of the Celanese
Shares, such as the payment of fair cash compensation under the Domination
Agreement for the remaining Celanese Shares, and payment obligations related to
outstanding stock appreciation rights, stock options and interest payments,
provide additional funds for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, and pay related fees and expenses.

    BCP Caylux used the proceeds from the offering of the senior subordinated
notes, together with available cash and borrowings under the floating rate term
loan to repay its two senior subordinated bridge loan facilities, plus accrued
interest, to redeem the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares and to pay
related fees and expenses. The issuers of the senior discount notes used the net
proceeds from the offering to make a return of capital distribution to the
Issuer, which in turn made a distribution to the Original Stockholders, and to
pay fees and expenses."

stock, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses,
will be approximately $757 million. We estimate that the net proceeds from the

    We intend to contribute $773 million of the net proceeds from the offering
of our Series A common stock and the offering of our preferred stock to our
subsidiary, Crystal LLC, which will use approximately $207 million of such net
proceeds to redeem a portion of its senior discount notes. Crystal LLC will
contribute the remaining proceeds to its subsidiary, Celanese Holdings, which in
turn will contribute it to its subsidiary, BCP Crystal. BCP Crystal will use
such proceeds to redeem a portion of its senior subordinated notes. BCP Crystal
will use borrowings of approximately $945 million under the new senior credit
facilities that it expects to enter into prior to the consummation of the
Series A common stock offering to repay the amounts outstanding under the
floating rate term loan and to pay a $586 million dividend to Celanese Holdings,
which in turn will distribute this amount to Crystal LLC. Crystal LLC will
distribute this amount up to us and we will use it, together with the remaining
net proceeds from the offering of our Series A common stock and the net proceeds
from the offering of our preferred stock, to pay a dividend of $803 million to
the holders of our Series B common stock. The loans under our existing senior
credit facilities will remain outstanding under the new senior credit
facilities. The Original Stockholders will be the only holders of our Series B
common stock immediately prior to the consummation of this offering. The
expected sources and uses of funds used in connection with the Concurrent
Financings (assuming a January 2005 closing unless otherwise specified) are set
forth in the table below. The actual amounts may vary depending on the time of

   º Sources shown exclude the $442 million Acquisition Facility that we expect
     to borrow to fund the Acetex and Vinamul Polymers acquisitions, and which
     will include a delayed draw portion of up to $242 million. Prior to the
     consummation of the Series A common stock offering, we expect to amend and
     restate our existing senior credit facilities. We expect the terms of the
     new senior credit facilities to be substantially similar to the terms of
     our existing senior credit facilities described below under ""Description of

    We intend to use the net proceeds from any shares of our Series A common

additional cash dividend to the holders of our Series B common stock.

    Approximately $217 million, or 22% ($331 million, or 30%, if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), of the combined net
proceeds from the offering of our Series A common stock and the offering of our

$917 million, if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full)
special Series B common stock dividends, in each case based on an initial public
offering price of $16.00 per share of Series A common stock. In addition,
$586 million of the proceeds from additional borrowings under the new senior
credit facilities will be used to fund the remaining portion of the special
Series B common stock dividends such that approximately $803 million, or 40%
($917 million, or 44%, if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full) of the combined proceeds from this offering and the other Concurrent
Financings will be paid to the Original Stockholders.

    The interest rate and maturity of indebtedness that we intend to discharge
using the net proceeds from the Concurrent Financings, as well as the use of
proceeds from such indebtedness, are described below:

    Senior Discount Notes.  In September 2004, our subsidiaries Crystal US 3
Holdings L.L.C. and Crystal US Sub 3 Corp., issued $853 million aggregate
principal amount at maturity ($513 million in gross proceeds) of their Senior
Discount Notes due 2014 consisting of $163 million aggregate principal amount at
maturity of its 10% Series A Senior Discount Notes and $690 million aggregate
principal amount at maturity of their 101/2% Series B Senior Discount Notes.
Prior to October 1, 2009, interest will accrue on the senior discount notes in
the form of an increase in their accreted value. Cash interest payments will be
due and payable beginning on April 1, 2010.

    Senior Subordinated Notes.  In June and July 2004, BCP Caylux issued
$1,225 million aggregate principal amount of 95/8% U.S. Dollar-denominated
senior subordinated notes and 200 million principal amount of 103/8%
Euro-denominated senior subordinated notes. The senior subordinated notes mature
on June 15, 2014.

    Senior Credit Facilities.  In April 2004, BCP Caylux entered into senior
credit facilities with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led
by Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc., as global coordinator, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and

Bank, Ltd., The Bank of Nova Scotia, KfW and Commerzbank AG, New York and Cayman
Branches, as senior managing agents. The senior credit facilities provide
financing of approximately $1.2 billion. The senior credit facilities consist of
(1) a term loan facility in the aggregate amount of $456 million and 125 million
with a maturity of seven years; (2) a $228 million credit-linked revolving
facility with a maturity of five years; and (3) a $380 million revolving credit
facility with a maturity of five years.

    We expect to increase the commitments under the revolving credit facilities
to $828 million under our new senior credit facilities. In addition, upon the
occurrence of certain events, BCP Crystal may request, prior to April 6, 2005,
an increase to the existing term loan facility in an amount not to exceed
$175 million in the aggregate, subject to receipt of commitments by existing

    The above-referenced promissory note matures on September 30, 2007, but
under its terms we must repay the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid
interest concurrently with closing this offering. The full $14.0 million of

2003, the note has accrued interest at a rate of 8% per annum. The note is held
by several of our stockholders, which are funds affiliated with MPM Asset
Management LLC, two affiliates of which are members of our board of directors.

    Other than the immediate prepayment of the note, we are not obligated to use
the net proceeds from this offering for any particular purpose and the amounts
and timing of our actual use of proceeds will depend upon numerous factors,
including cash flows from operations, the growth of our business and other
factors described under “Risk Factors.” Also, although we periodically evaluate
acquisition and licensing opportunities, we currently have no commitments or
agreements with respect to any specific acquisition or license. As a result, we
cannot specify with certainty the amounts that we may allocate to the particular
uses of the net proceeds of this offering. Our management will have significant
flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering.

    (1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we        
          received from Mr. Gordon described below. These funds will be repaid out  
          of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon           
          consummation of this offering.                                            



$31,200,000, or $36,222,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to American Fund Advisors, an affiliate of Barry J. Gordon, Marc H.
Klee and Alan J. Loewenstein, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by American Fund Advisors for our
benefit and is not intended to provide any of our officers or directors
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the Garden City, New York area, that the fee charged by
American Fund Advisors is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination or our
liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $590,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $60,000) with
the balance of $530,000, being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.


Barry J. Gordon, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, has
advanced to us a total of $77,500 which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loans
will be payable without interest on the earlier of September 30, 2005 or the
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay American Fund Advisors the
fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business
combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

    (1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we        
          received from Mr. Gordon described below. These funds will be repaid out  
          of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon           
          consummation of this offering.                                            



$31,200,000, or $36,222,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to American Fund Advisors, an affiliate of Barry J. Gordon, Marc H.
Klee and Alan J. Loewenstein, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by American Fund Advisors for our
benefit and is not intended to provide any of our officers or directors
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the Garden City, New York area, that the fee charged by
American Fund Advisors is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination or our
liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $590,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $60,000) with
the balance of $530,000, being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.


Barry J. Gordon, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, has
advanced to us a total of $77,500 which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loans
will be payable without interest on the earlier of September 30, 2005 or the
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay American Fund Advisors the
fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business
combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

support our  anticipated  future  growth.  The net  proceeds  will depend on the
expenses  incurred by us in connection with the offering and the total number of
shares of stock  issued in the  offering,  which will depend on the  independent
valuation and market  considerations.  Although the actual net proceeds from the
sale of the common stock cannot be  determined  until the offering is completed,
we  estimate  that net  proceeds  from the sale of common  stock will be between
$137.7  million at the minimum and $186.7 million at the maximum of the offering
range (and  $214.9  million at the  maximum,  as  adjusted,  if the  independent
valuation is increased by 15%).

         Kearny  Financial  Corp.  intends  to use the  net  proceeds  from  the

         We will use 50% of the net proceeds from the offering to make a capital
contribution  to Kearny  Federal  Savings  Bank.  We will  also lend the  Kearny
Federal  Savings Bank's employee stock ownership plan cash to enable the plan to
buy up to 8% of the shares sold in the offering. If the employee stock ownership
plan does not purchase  common stock in the offering,  it may purchase shares of
common stock in the open market after the stock offering.  If the purchase price
of the  common  stock is higher  than $10 per  share,  the  amount  of  proceeds
required for the purchase by the employee stock ownership plan will increase and
the  resulting  stockholders'  equity  will  decrease.  The  balance  of the net
proceeds  will be  retained  by  Kearny  Financial  Corp.  and used for  general
business  purposes,  which may include  investment in  securities,  repurchasing
shares of our common stock,  paying cash  dividends or supporting  acquisitions.
However,  under current regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision,  we may
not  repurchase  shares of our common stock during the first year  following the
offering,  except  where  extraordinary   circumstances  exist  and  with  prior
regulatory  approval.  We will  initially  invest  these  proceeds  in  short to
intermediate term investment securities.

         The funds  received  by Kearny  Federal  Savings  Bank will be used for
general  business   purposes,   including   originating   loans  and  purchasing
securities.  In addition to building our core banking  business through internal
growth  and  de  novo  branching,  we  will  also  actively  consider  expansion
opportunities  such  as the  acquisition  of  branches  and of  other  financial
institutions. We do not, however, have any current understandings, agreements or
arrangements for expansion by the acquisition of any branches or other financial
institutions.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  successful  in
implementing this growth strategy. We may have difficulty finding suitable sites
for de novo branches and  identifying  and  successfully  acquiring  branches or
other  financial  institutions.  We may also pursue other  business  activities,
including  possibly  offering  asset  management  services,  acquiring  a  title
insurance company and/or acquiring
a mortgage banking  operation.  There are, however,  no current  understandings,
arrangements or agreements for these activities and we cannot assure you that we
will commence such activities.

         The net proceeds may vary  significantly  because total expenses of the
stock offering may be significantly  more or less than those estimated.  The net
proceeds  will  also  vary if the  number  of  shares  to be issued in the stock
offering is adjusted to reflect a change in the estimated pro forma market value
of Kearny  Financial  Corp.  Payments for shares made through  withdrawals  from
existing  deposit accounts at Kearny Federal Savings Bank will not result in the
receipt of new funds for  investment  but will result in a  reduction  of Kearny
Federal  Savings Bank's  deposits and interest  expense as funds are transferred
from interest-bearing certificates or other deposit accounts."

                  funds we received from Messrs. Leight and Weiss described      
                  below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this  
                  offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this   
                  offering.                                                      


$42,640,000, or $49,336,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Terrapin Partners LLC, an affiliate of Nathan Leight, our
chairman of the board, Jason Weiss, our chief executive officer, Lyla Oyakawa,
our vice president of business development, and Robert Plotkin, our chief
technology officer, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for certain administrative,
technology and secretarial services, as well as the use of certain limited
office space, including a conference room, in New York City. This arrangement is
being agreed to by Terrapin Partners for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Messrs. Leight, Weiss and Plotkin or Ms. Oyakawa compensation in lieu of
a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the New 
York City metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Terrapin Partners
LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated
person. Upon completion of a business combination or our liquidation, we will no
longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $580,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $95,000), with
the balance of $485,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

Nathan Leight, our chairman of the board, and Jason Weiss, our chief executive
officer, have advanced to us a total of $70,000 which was used to pay a portion
of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loans
will be payable without interest on the earlier of December 10, 2005 or the
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Terrapin Partners the fee
described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, our officers or directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, they will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

from our sale of the 10,500,000 shares of Class A common stock offered by us in
this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds of
approximately $242.2 million. We will not receive any of the net proceeds from
the sale of the shares by the selling stockholders.


The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
Class A common stock, to facilitate our future access to the public equity
markets and to obtain additional capital. We currently have no specific plans
for the use of the net proceeds of this offering. We anticipate that we will use
the net proceeds received by us from this offering, including any net proceeds
we receive from the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, for
general corporate purposes, including working capital. We intend to use a
portion of our working capital, including cash we receive from the proceeds of
this offering, as well as the cash generated from our operations, to fund the
costs of operating as a public company, including the anticipated increase in
legal and administrative costs. In addition, we may use a portion of the
proceeds of this offering for acquisitions of complementary businesses,
technologies or other assets. We have no current agreements or commitments with
respect to any material acquisitions. Pending such uses, we plan to invest the
net proceeds in highly liquid, investment grade securities."

    $24,768,000, or $28,483,200 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business or
to effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of directors at that
time.

    The payment to Coastal Acquisition, LLC, an affiliate of Mr. Grossman and
Mr. Brunson, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities, and secretarial support. Although
the monthly rents and fee were arbitrarily arrived at, we believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the Houston, Texas area, that the fees
charged by Coastal Acquisition, LLC are at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person.

    We intend to use the excess working capital shown above for director and
officer liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve in
the event that due diligence, legal, accounting, and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

    Coastal Acquisition, LLC, an affiliate of Mr. Grossman and Mr. Brunson, has
entered into a non-interest bearing revolving credit agreement with us in the
amount of $75,000. Advances under the credit facility will be used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line item above for
SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The
loan will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering. As of the date of
this prospectus, $75,000 has been advanced under the revolving credit agreement.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested in
general debt obligations of the United States Government or other high-quality,
short-term interest-bearing investments so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation
of the acquisition of a target business, we will pay Coastal Acquisition, LLC
the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind, including finder's and consulting fees, will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business
combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, attending management or
board meetings, and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.

    Since the role of present directors and management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund,
including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund, only in
the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert their shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust fund."

offered by Cendant. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares in full, the net proceeds to us from the additional shares of
common stock will be $102.6 million. We expect to use any net proceeds from the
exercise of the underwriters’ option for general corporate purposes, which may
include repayment of borrowings under our new five-year revolving credit
facility, which will bear interest at floating rates tied to either the Prime
Rate or LIBOR, and share repurchases. We expect to borrow approximately $50.0
million under our new revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the special
dividend we intend to pay to Cendant in connection with this offering. All or a
portion of this amount could be repaid if the underwriters’ option is exercised.
Pending the use of such proceeds, we intend to invest the proceeds in short-term
interest-bearing instruments or money-market accounts."

this offering will be $23.4 million. “Net proceeds” is what we expect to receive
after paying the underwriters’ discounts and commissions and other expenses of
the offering.

We intend to use $9.3 million of the net proceeds from this offering to repay
all of our existing indebtedness and the remainder for general corporate
purposes, including acquisition of inventory, upgrades of our websites and
marketing activities.

The other principal purposes of this offering are to increase our equity
capital, to create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate future
access by us to public equity markets, to provide liquidity to existing
stockholders, to provide increased visibility and credibility in a marketplace
where several of our current and potential competitors are or will be publicly
held companies, and to enhance our ability to use our common stock as
consideration for acquisitions and as a means of attracting and retaining key
employees.

As of February 14, 2005, we had $9.3 million of indebtedness outstanding under
our new bank credit facility, approximately $5.5 million of which was used for
the repayment of indebtedness and approximately $3.8 million of which was used
to purchase inventory. The outstanding indebtedness under our new bank credit
facility accrues interest at a variable rate equal to the greater of 4.0% or
0.5% above the current prime rate. The current interest under this credit
facility is 5.75% per annum. This variable interest rate adjusts when the prime
rate changes. We are obligated to pay the lender interest only on a monthly
basis. The principal amount and any accrued and unpaid interest is due in August
2006.

The amounts actually expended for each of the purposes listed above (other than
the repayment of indebtedness) and the timing of our actual expenditures will
depend on numerous factors, including growth in our net sales, sales and
marketing activities, technological advances, amount of cash generated or used
by our operations and the other factors described in “Risk Factors.” We have not
determined the amount or timing of expenditures for the corporate purposes
listed above and will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of the
net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

estimated offering expenses from the offering are estimated at $13.35 million
based on an assumed initial public offering price of $6.00 per share. If the
underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised in full, we estimate our net
proceeds will be approximately $15.44 million.

 

The principal purposes of this offering are to raise funds, create a public
market for our common stock, facilitate our future access to the public capital
markets and increase our visibility. Upon the closing of this offering, the
balance under our current credit facility will be transferred to our new credit
facility, under which we may make borrowings and repayments for two years
following the closing of this offering, and our current credit facility will be
terminated. Our new credit facility requires that we use the net proceeds of
this offering to reduce the outstanding balance under that facility. The balance
under our current credit facility was approximately $8.8 million as of September
30, 2004. We reduced the outstanding balance under our current credit facility
to approximately $6.8 million as of November 24, 2004 using cash flow from our
operations. Our current credit facility is a demand note with no maturity date;
bore interest at an effective rate of 4.1% for the nine months ended September
30, 2004; and has been utilized for our general corporate purposes, including
working capital.

 

We will repay the outstanding balance under our new credit facility with the
proceeds of this offering, which will increase our borrowing capacity to $8
million. We will use the borrowing capacity under our new credit facility as
needed together with the remaining net proceeds from this offering to implement
our intended business plan, including:

 

  •   approximately $1.0 to expand our sales and marketing capabilities;


 

  •   approximately $6.6 to expand our manufacturing capacity; and


 

  •   approximately $3.6 to expand our capacity to provide testing services.


 

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering and cash flow from our
operations, together with additional availability under our credit facility,
will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through the end
of 2006.

 

The amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of
factors, including the amount of cash generated or used by our operations,
competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of
our business. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire
additional businesses, services, products or technologies or invest in
additional businesses that we believe will complement our current or future
business. We have no specific plans, agreements or commitments to do so,
however, and are not currently engaged in any negotiations for any acquisition
or investment. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of
the net proceeds of this offering. After reducing the balance of our credit
facility and pending the uses described above, we will invest the remaining net
proceeds of this offering in cash, cash-equivalents, money market funds or
short-term interest-bearing, investment-grade securities to the extent

private placement will be approximately $351.5 million, based on (1) the sale of
shares of our common stock at an initial public offering price of $6.75 per
share, after deducting the underwriters’ discount, financial advisory fee and
estimated offering and merger expenses payable by us and (2) the concurrent
private placement of $25 million of our common stock to an affiliate of
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc. at a per share price of $6.345, which is
equal to the initial public offering price less the underwriting discount. We
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling
stockholders.

 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement, which are estimated to be approximately $351.5 million, for general
working capital purposes, substantially all of which will be used to build a
portfolio of mortgage loans and, if necessary to maintain our REIT status, to
purchase mortgage-backed securities, primarily those issued by Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, which we have not yet specifically identified.

 

The table below summarizes certain information relating to the uses of proceeds
that we expect in connection with this offering and the concurrent private
placement, assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters’
over-allotment option. We estimate that substantially all of the net proceeds of
this offering and the concurrent private placement received by us will be
available for the purchase of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities.
While the estimated use of proceeds set forth in the table below is believed to
be reasonable, this table should be viewed only as an estimate of the use of
proceeds that may be achieved.

approximately $97.0 million, or $111.8 million if the underwriters exercise
their over-allotment option in full. We intend to use (1) $50.0 million of our
net proceeds from this offering to pay a special dividend to CenTra, our sole
shareholder on the record date for such dividend, that was declared by our board
of directors on December 28, 2004, (2) $32.5 million of our net proceeds of this
offering to repay outstanding debt under our secured lines of credit, including
accrued interest thereon, and (3) the balance of our net proceeds from this
offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including
expansion of our network of agents and owner-operators. In addition, although we
currently have no specific acquisition plans, we may use a portion of our net
proceeds, as well as borrowings under our secured line of credit, to acquire
businesses that complement our primarily non-asset based business model, as well
as businesses that derive a portion of their revenue from asset-based
operations.

    The amount of indebtedness we expect to repay consists of $30.3 million
outstanding at October 2, 2004 and an additional $2.2 million incurred after
October 2, 2004, as shown in the pro forma adjustments described in the
unaudited pro forma balance sheet included under the heading “Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Information.” Our outstanding debt that we intend to repay
consists of our borrowings under our $40.0 million secured line of credit, a
portion of the proceeds of which were used to pay for our acquisitions of AFA
and NYP, and borrowings of Great American Lines, Inc. under its secured line of
credit. Amounts borrowed under our secured line of credit bear interest at a
rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.80% per annum (for an effective rate of 3.79% per
annum at October 2, 2004) and are collateralized by our accounts receivable
generated by each of our operating subsidiaries other than AFA. The secured line
of credit agreement matures on August 31, 2005. Amounts borrowed under the
secured line of credit of Great American Lines bear interest at a rate equal to
either the bank’s prime rate or LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum (for an effective
rate of 3.74% per annum at October 2, 2004). Great American Line’s secured line
of credit matures on June 30, 2005. At October 2, 2004, the aggregate balance
outstanding under these secured lines of credit totaled $30.3 million.

    We will have significant discretion in the use of the portion of the net
proceeds we receive from this offering that will not be used to pay the dividend
in favor of CenTra or repay outstanding debt. Investors will be relying on the
judgment of our management regarding the application of these net proceeds. In
addition, any investments, capital expenditures, cash acquisitions or other
application of these proceeds may not produce the anticipated results. Pending
use of these proceeds as discussed above, we intend to invest these funds in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade obligations."

sale of 2,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions but before estimated offering expenses.
Our estimate assumes no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. We
anticipate using a portion of the aggregate net proceeds of this offering:

        º to repay approximately $22.9 million of outstanding indebtedness, the
          terms of which are described below (which includes $14.0 million under
          Continental Gas' term loan and $8.9 million under Hiland Partners,
          LLC's term loan);

        º to pay the remaining $1.0 million of expenses associated with the
          offering and related formation transactions;

        º to make a distribution of approximately $4.5 million to the owners of
          Hiland Partners, LLC in reimbursement of certain capitalized
          expenditures related to the assets of Hiland Partners, LLC that we
          will own after the offering; and

        º to make a distribution of approximately $2.8 million to the owners of
          Continental Gas, Inc. in reimbursement of certain capitalized
          expenditures related to the assets of Continental Gas, Inc. that we
          will own after the offering.

    The remaining proceeds of approximately $10.7 million will be used to
replenish working capital that was not contributed to us in the formation
transactions. Substantially all of these proceeds will be used to pay current
liabilities (approximately $9.3 million as of September 30, 2004) when they
become due.

    In connection with the formation transactions, we are assuming approximately
$14.0 million of indebtedness under Continental Gas' term loan. This term loan
matures on September 30, 2006 and, as of December 31, 2004, bore interest at
4.9%. Substantially all of the outstanding indebtedness under this term loan was
incurred to fund the acquisition of the Carmen gathering system.

    In addition, we are assuming approximately $8.9 million of indebtedness
under Hiland Partners, LLC's term loan. This facility matures on May 24, 2005
and, as of December 31, 2004, bore interest at 4.9%. Substantially all of this
outstanding indebtedness was incurred to fund the acquisition of our compression
facilities.

    In connection with our formation in consummation of this offering, we are
required to make a distribution to the owners of Hiland Partners, LLC and
Continental Gas, Inc. as reimbursement of certain capitalized expenditures to
the extent the net proceeds from the offering after the repayment of expenses of
the offering and outstanding indebtedness exceeds the working capital assets of
Hiland Partners, LLC and Continental Gas, Inc. that are not contributed to us.

    The proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option
will be used to redeem a number of common units, on a pro rata basis, from the
Hamm Parties equal to the number of common units issued upon exercise of the
over-allotment option."

common stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering costs of approximately $4.0 million payable
by us, will be approximately $416.0 million. We intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering plus $5.0 million from our revolving credit facility and $6.8
million of cash on hand to repay $100.0 million of our existing senior
indebtedness (plus a repayment premium of $3.0 million and accrued interest of
$1.3 million as of December 31, 2004), to redeem $84.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of our existing 91/4% senior subordinated notes (plus a
redemption premium of $7.8 million and accrued interest of $1.7 million as of
December 31, 2004), to contribute $197.8 million to Prestige International
Holdings, LLC, which will then use such proceeds to redeem all of its
outstanding senior preferred units and class B preferred units and to repurchase
an aggregate of 4,397,950 shares of our common stock held by the GTCR funds and
the TCW/Crescent funds for $32.2 million. Prestige International Holdings, LLC
is repurchasing the senior preferred units and class B preferred units to
eliminate them from our post-offering capital structure and to provide liquidity
to their holders. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of
shares by the selling stockholders if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised.

    As of December 31, 2004, the existing indebtedness to be repaid from a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering and the senior preferred units
and class B preferred units to be redeemed from a portion of the net proceeds
consisted of the following:

          with a repayment premium of approximately $3.0 million and accrued
          interest of $1.3 million as of December 31, 2004), which bears
          interest at a variable rate (7.8% weighted average interest rate at
          December 31, 2004) and has a final maturity of October 2011;

        
        º approximately $84.0 million of our senior subordinated notes, which
          bear interest at a rate of 91/4% per annum and mature in April 2012
          (together with a redemption premium of approximately $7.8 million and
          accrued interest of $1.7 million as of December 31, 2004);

        
        º approximately $23.7 million in aggregate liquidation value, including
          accrued but unpaid yield which accrues at a rate of 8% per annum,
          subject to adjustment, on the sum of the liquidation value plus all
          accumulated and unpaid yield, of senior preferred units; and

       
        º approximately $174.1 million in aggregate liquidation value, including
          accrued but unpaid yield which accrues at a rate of 8% per annum on
          the sum of the liquidation value plus all accumulated and unpaid
          yield, of class B preferred units.

    As of December 31, 2004, the number, aggregate liquidation value, including
accrued but unpaid yield, and holders of our senior preferred units and class B
preferred units outstanding that we will redeem with a portion of the net
proceeds of this offering were as follows:


        º 22,500 senior preferred units outstanding with an aggregate
          liquidation value, including accrued but unpaid yield, of
          $23.7 million held by TSG3 L.P. and related individuals;

        º 9,017.250 class B preferred units outstanding with an aggregate
          liquidation value, including accrued but unpaid yield, of $9.7 million

after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated
offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use our net proceeds from this
offering, together with $240.0 million of borrowings under our new senior credit
facility, which we intend to enter into in connection with this offering, and
our existing cash and cash equivalents, which we refer to collectively as the
“aggregate cash sources” as follows based on December 31, 2004 balances:

    •   $176.5 million to redeem approximately 126,437 shares of our class A       
        cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock, most of which is held by
        funds controlled by GTCR and some of which is indirectly held by current   
        and former employees of Lehman Brothers Inc.;                              

    •   $220.1 million to repay all borrowings outstanding under our existing      
        senior credit facility;                                                    

    •   $98.7 million to tender for $85.8 million in aggregate outstanding         
        principal amount of our 12 3/4% senior subordinated notes;                 

  •   $1.6 million to pay financing costs for the new senior credit facility; and

  •   $2.4 million to pay accrued interest on our existing senior credit facility.

Based on account balances reflected on our December 31, 2004 balance sheet, we
expect that such remaining aggregate cash sources would have been approximately
$2.6 million.

If the underwriters exercise their option, a portion of the shares purchased by
the underwriters will be issued by us and a portion of the shares will be sold
by the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders include members of our
senior management team. If the underwriters exercise their option in full, we
estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the underwriters’ exercise of
their option of approximately $29.3 million after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions. We intend to use any net proceeds we receive from the
underwriters’ exercise of their option to redeem additional shares of our class
A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares, if any, by the selling stockholders.

As of December 31, 2004, our existing indebtedness that we will repay with a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering and the preferred stock that we
will redeem with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering consisted of
the following:

    •   approximately $176.5 million in aggregate liquidation value of our class A 
        cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock, which currently accrues 
        dividends at a rate of 10% per annum on the sum of the liquidation value   
        plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends;                                 

    •   approximately $85.8 million of our senior subordinated notes, which bear   
        interest at a rate of 12 3/4% per annum and have a final maturity on       
        February 1, 2009; and                                                      

    •   approximately $220.1 million under the term loan B portion of our existing 
        senior credit facility, which bears interest at variable rates (4.8%       
        weighted average interest rate at September 30, 2004) and has a final      
        maturity of September 30, 2010.                                            

In the aggregate, we expect that GTCR and its affiliates, through their
ownership of preferred and common units of Syniverse Holdings, LLC, will receive
approximately $154.5 million of the net proceeds from this offering. See
“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” In addition, certain
current and former employees of Lehman Brothers Inc. who indirectly own shares
of our class A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock will receive a
portion of the net proceeds of this offering upon our redemption of those
shares, which proceeds will not exceed $250,000 in the aggregate. Each share of
our outstanding class A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock that
we do not redeem with the net proceeds of this offering will be converted,
within 45 days after the completion of this offering, into a number of shares of
our common stock determined by dividing the liquidation value of $1,000 per
share of our class A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock plus all
accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon through the closing date of this
offering by the initial public offering price of our common stock in this
offering."

(1) This amount reflects repayment of $392.1 million of term loans under our    
    existing credit facility, less $25.0 million of subordinated capital        
    certificates previously issued to us by the Rural Telephone Finance         
    Cooperative, or RTFC, which will be redeemed by RTFC upon such repayment.   
   
(2) Does not include accrued interest, which will be paid out of cash on hand.  
   
(3) Includes estimated prepayment fees of $21.0 million associated with the     
    repayment of the second lien loan, senior subordinated loan and a portion of
    our term loans, and includes an estimated $6.8 million in fees and expenses 
    related to the syndication of our new credit facility.                      


If the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, the
underwriters will purchase an aggregate of 4,406,250 shares of common stock from
our existing equity holders. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the
sale of common stock by our existing equity holders.

Our existing credit facility consists of a $900.0 million term loan B, a
$270.0 million term loan C and a $30.0 million term loan D. Each of these term
loans matures on November 10, 2011. As of November 30, 2004, amounts outstanding
under the term loan B bore interest at a weighted average annual rate of 5.68%,
our term loan C bore interest at a weighted average annual rate of 6.94% and our
term loan D bore interest at a weighted average annual rate of 6.38%. We used
some of the proceeds from our term loan B to refinance our previous credit
facilities. The second lien loan will mature on November 10, 2011, and the
senior subordinated loan will mature on May 10, 2012. As of November 30, 2004,
amounts outstanding under the second lien loan bore interest at a weighted
average annual rate of 9.93%. Amounts outstanding under the senior subordinated
loan bore interest at an annual rate of 12.88%. The proceeds from the second
lien loan and the senior subordinated loan, together with the proceeds from our
revolving facility and term loans, were used to refinance our then existing
credit facilities."

are offering at an initial offering price of $6.00 per unit will be
approximately $9.5 million, or $10.5 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and after deducting estimated offering expenses. The primary
purposes of this offering are to obtain additional equity capital, create a
public market for our common stock and facilitate future access to public
capital markets.

    We will use approximately $7.8 million of the net proceeds of this offering
to repay substantially all of the Paragon Notes in an aggregate principal amount
of $7.3 million and pay all dividends due on our outstanding Series C Redeemable
Preferred Stock. All of the Paragon Notes carry an annual interest rate of 7%.
Of the portion of the Paragon Notes which we will repay with the net proceeds of
this offering, an aggregate principal amount of $6.2 million matures on the
earlier of February 15, 2005 or the date on which we receive the proceeds of
this offering and an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 million matures on
February 28, 2005. We are obligated to pay dividends on our outstanding shares
of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock equal to 5% of the redemption value per
annum (or $300,000 per year on 100 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred
Stock). See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.""

    We intend to use the remaining net proceeds we receive from this offering
for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital
and possible strategic acquisitions that we may determine to pursue in the
future. See ""Business—Our Strategy—Acquisitions."" We frequently evaluate
acquisition opportunities and, at any given time, may be in various stages of
due diligence or preliminary discussions with respect to a number of potential
transactions. From time to time, we may enter into non-binding letters of
intent, but we are not currently subject to any definitive agreement with
respect to any transaction material to our operations or otherwise so far
advanced in any discussions as to make a transaction material to our operations
reasonably certain. Pending final use, we may invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities or
guaranteed obligations of the United States or its agencies.

Stock, at prices of 114% and 112% of the applicable liquidation preference,

liquidation preference, respectively, at December 31, 2004, plus accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon to the anticipated purchase dates of such preferred

aggregate consideration of $30 million) and the balance of such shares and all
of our 12% Junior Redeemable Exchangeable Cumulative Preferred Stock on or about

the date of redemption.

     Redemption of FTD's 7.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 requires not
less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders thereof. Pending
such redemption, any net proceeds from the over-allotment option will be

    We intend to use $4.0 million of our net proceeds to repay borrowings
outstanding under our subordinated notes issued to Advantage Capital Alabama
Partners I, L.P., Enhanced Alabama Issuer, LLC and Whitecap Alabama Growth

be approximately US$88 million, assuming an initial public offering price of
US$14.50 per ADS, the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page
of this prospectus, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full, the net proceeds to us would be approximately
US$106 million. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the
ADSs by the selling shareholders.

    The principal reason for this offering is to establish a public market for
our common shares, facilitate our future access to public capital markets and
obtain additional working capital to continue to grow our business. As of the
date of this prospectus, we have not identified specific allocations for the net
proceeds from this offering other than as discussed below. We anticipate using
the net proceeds of this offering to be received by us as follows:

   • approximately W30 billion (US$26 million) for on-going and future game      
     development;                                                                
  
   • approximately W30 billion (US$26 million) for acquiring licensing and       
     publishing games developed by third party game developers;                  
  
   • approximately W25 billion (US$22 million) for investing in enhancing our    
     technological, marketing, distribution and service capabilities; and

    The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on several
factors, including the amount of cash generated or used by our ongoing
operations. We have neither determined the timing of the expenditures nor the
actual amounts to be expended in any specific area. Pending their use, we intend
to invest the net proceeds in low-yielding bank deposits or other short-term
securities which are not considered to be investment securities."

public offering price of $7.00 per share, and after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs payable by
us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we estimate that
we will receive additional net proceeds of approximately $5.2 million. We expect
to use the net proceeds toward funding:

 

    •    approximately $45.0 million for the clinical development of glufosfamide, 
         TH-070 and 2DG, including trials for additional indications;              


 

    •    approximately $8.0 million for research and development of additional     
         product candidates;

         infrastructure; and                                                       


 

    •    the remainder, if any, for working capital, capital expenditures and other
         general corporate purposes, including potential strategic acquisitions.   


 

We will use our cash on hand to fund the shortfall between the proceeds of this
offering and the uses described above. We expect our net proceeds from this
offering, together with our cash on hand, will be sufficient to advance our
clinical development programs to complete our Phase 3 clinical trial of
glufosfamide for second-line treatment of pancreatic cancer, and to advance our
TH-070 and 2DG clinical programs and our clinical program for glufosfamide for
the first-line treatment of pancreatic cancer into Phase 3 trials.

 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the timing and success of preclinical testing, the timing and
success of our ongoing clinical trials and any clinical trials we may commence
in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions, our commercialization
strategy for TH-070, status of our research and development programs, the amount
of proceeds actually raised in this offering and the amount of cash generated by
our operations, if any. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the
acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets
that complement our business. However, we have no present understandings,
commitments or agreements to enter into any potential acquisitions or
investments. Our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net
proceeds from this offering.

 

Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of the offering in United States government and short-term investment
grade securities."

offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised
in full, the net proceeds we will receive will be approximately $67.5 million.
We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the ADSs by the selling
shareholders.

 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows, though the
allocation of the use of proceeds may change along with evolving business
conditions and other management considerations:

 

    •   up to 50% for potential acquisitions in businesses that we believe are     
        complementary to our existing business, although no acquisitions are       
        pending;                                                                   


 

    •   up to 5% for repayment of our outstanding short-term loans;


 

    •   up to 10% for our capital expenditures for acquisition or licensing of key 
        Internet and wireless data application technologies and adding supporting  
        server software and hardware systems;                                      


 

    •   up to 10% for product development; and


 

    •   any remaining balance for general corporate purposes.


 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a passive
foreign investment company for United States federal income taxpayers, which
could result in negative tax consequences for you."

deducting the underwriting discount and the estimated expenses related to this 
offering. We intend to use $111.5 million of the net proceeds of this offering, 
together with indebtedness of approximately $145.0 million, 1,277,778 shares of 
our common stock and up to an additional $30.0 million under another new credit 
facility that we may procure, to acquire the Identified Vessels. The balance, 
in the approximate amount of $94.2 million, will be used for working capital 
and other corporate purposes, including future vessel acquisitions. We will 
have $7.0 million in cash immediately prior to the closing of this offering. 

We will pay $322.3 million to acquire the 11 Identified Vessels, which includes 
the purchase price of the vessels as well as pre-delivery, financing, drydocking 
and special survey expenses that were incurred by the sellers prior to the 
vessels' delivery to us and that we will reimburse to the sellers. The $322.3 
million consists of a cash payment of $299.3 million to acquire 10 of the 11 
Identified Vessels and the cash equivalent of $23.0 million of our common 
shares (1,277,778 shares of our common stock) for the eleventh Identified 
Vessel. We will acquire the Capesize drybulk carrier Netadola and five Panamax 
drybulk carriers Paragon, Samsara, Waikiki, Toro, and Iguana from companies 
beneficially owned by Mr. Economou's sister for a total purchase price of 
$197.8 million. The acquisition of the Capesize drybulk carrier Netadola and 
four Panamax drybulk carriers, Paragon, Samsara, Waikiki and Toro, will be at 
the same purchase prices as those companies paid when they acquired the vessels 
from unaffiliated third parties ($164.3 million). We will purchase the Panamax 
drybulk carrier Iguana at its fair market value ($33.5 million) because of the 
time that elapsed from the time the seller contracted to purchase the vessel 
from its previous owner in August 2004, and the date that we agreed to purchase 
it in October 2004. The deliveries of these six Identified Vessels will occur 
between the closing of this offering and April 29, 2005. We will acquire the 
remaining five Identified Vessels directly from unaffiliated third parties at 
the aggregate purchase price of $119.0 million. 

If we do not purchase the Identified Vessels, we may use the proceeds of this 
offering to purchase other vessels or for general corporate purposes. In 
particular, certain events may arise which could result in us not taking 
delivery of a vessel, such as a total loss of a vessel, a constructive total 
loss of a vessel, or substantial damage to a vessel prior to its delivery. 

The net proceeds of this offering together with the borrowings under the new 
credit facility will be sufficient to allow us to acquire the 11 Identified 
Vessels."

$38.0 million, based upon an initial public offering price of $7.00 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, we estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be
approximately $43.8 million.

We estimate that it will cost approximately $71.0 million to complete the
development and file for regulatory approval of FavId. Based on this estimate,
we intend to use approximately $26.0 million of the net proceeds from this
offering and approximately $26.0 million from our existing cash and cash
equivalents for this purpose. We expect that we will need to raise an additional
estimated $19.0 million to complete the development and file for regulatory
approval of FavId after this offering. We may seek to raise the additional
capital through the public or private equity markets, arrangements with
collaborative partners or other alternatives. However, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, or at
all. In addition, we intend to use approximately $3.1 million for principal and
interest payments on the existing $6.3 million in debt as of September 30, 2004
under the terms of our equipment and leasehold debt financing arrangements. The
remaining debt repayment will be made from our current cash. These obligations
are secured by certain of the purchased equipment and leasehold improvements and
are due in monthly installments through July 2007. They bear interest at
effective rates ranging from approximately 9.34% to 14.66% and include terminal
payments at the end of the loans ranging from 5.75% to 12.75%.

We intend to allocate the remaining net proceeds from this offering as follows:
21% for the development of our other product candidates; 69% for general and
administrative expenses and 10% for working capital, including the purchase of
equipment for the expansion of our current manufacturing capabilities to support
production of clinical trial material and prepare for commercial launch of our
lead product candidate.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with interest
thereon and our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to meet
our projected operating costs for at least the next 24 months.

The amount and timing of our use of the net proceeds from this offering will
depend on a number of factors, including the status of our development and
commercialization efforts, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this
offering and the amount of proceeds generated, if any, by entering into future
partnerships or collaborations with third-parties. We may also use a portion of
the proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies
or products that complement our technology or business. However, we have no
present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any potential
acquisitions or investments at this time. We will have broad discretion to
determine the ultimate use of the net proceeds from this offering, which may
differ substantially from the estimated uses outlined above.

We intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering, pending their use, in
short-term and medium-term interest-bearing, investment grade instruments, money
market funds, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
United States government. Our goal with respect to the investment of the net
proceeds of this offering is capital preservation and liquidity so that such
funds are readily available to fund our research and development operations and
other working capital needs."

PRUDENTIAL BANCORP INC OF PENNSYLVANIA,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/prudential-bancorp-inc-of-pennsylvania-649825-41336,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/prudential-bancorp-inc-of-pennsylvania-649825-41336,424B3,2/4/2005,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3440573,"Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of our common stock cannot
be determined until the reorganization is completed, it is presently anticipated
that the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock will be between $35.0
million at the minimum of the offering range and $47.7 million at
the maximum of the offering range. The net proceeds may increase up to $55.0
million assuming an increase in the offering range by approximately 15%. 

      We will use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:

-----------------
(1)   If the employee stock ownership plan buys shares in the open market after
      the reorganization, the purchase price of those shares may be more or less
      than the $10.00 per share offering price, which will change the amount of
      net proceeds used for this purpose.

      The loan to our employee stock ownership plan will be approximately $2.9
million and $3.9 million at the minimum and maximum of the offering range,
assuming that it is able to purchase shares in the offering at the purchase
price of $10.00 per share. Our employee stock ownership plan will allocate the
shares it purchases to employees as the loan is repaid. Purchases by our
employee stock ownership plan would amount to 393,300 shares at the maximum of
the range or $3.9 million based on a per share price of $10.00. Depending on
market conditions, shares purchased for the stock recognition and retention plan
may not be purchased at $10.00 per share. In the event that the price of our
common stock has increased, the cost of the shares purchased for the stock
recognition and retention plan will be greater. In addition, if our stock
recognition and retention plan is adopted by the board of directors and approved
by shareholders, we intend to contribute sufficient funds to the stock
recognition and retention plan so that we can purchase a number of shares equal
to an aggregate of 4.00% of the shares sold in the offering (excluding shares
issued to Prudential Mutual Holding Company). 

      The net proceeds received from the sale of shares of our common stock in
the offering will increase the capital of both Prudential Bancorp and Prudential
Savings Bank. Half of the net proceeds from the offering will be used by
Prudential Bancorp to buy the common stock of Prudential Savings Bank. While we
have not identified specific uses for the portion of the net proceeds to be
invested in Prudential Savings Bank, we anticipate that Prudential Savings Bank
will use the portion of the cash proceeds it receives for general corporate
purposes. On a short-term basis, Prudential Savings Bank may purchase investment
and mortgage-backed securities. The net proceeds received by Prudential Savings
Bank will further increase its capital position, which already exceeds all
regulatory requirements. As discussed below, due to Prudential Savings Bank's
existing capital position, increasing its capital position was not the primary
reason for undertaking the reorganization. At September 30, 2004, Prudential
Savings Bank's Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 9.39%. After the
reorganization, Prudential Savings Bank's Tier 1 leverage capital ratio will be
13.07%, based upon the maximum of the offering range. As a result, Prudential
Savings Bank will continue to be a well-capitalized institution and will have
additional flexibility to grow and diversify. The proceeds invested in
Prudential Savings Bank, in addition to
funding new loans and investing in investment and mortgage-backed securities,
may also be used to finance the further expansion of our banking operations. In
addition, the net proceeds may ultimately be used in the future to support
further expansion of Prudential Savings Bank's operations through acquisitions
of other financial institutions or branch offices, although no such transactions
are specifically being considered at this time.

      A portion of the net proceeds from the offering retained by Prudential
Bancorp will be used to make a loan to our employee stock ownership plan in an
amount sufficient to permit it to buy an amount equal to 8.0% of the shares of
our common stock sold in the offering (excluding shares issued to Prudential
Mutual Holding Company). The remaining portion of the net proceeds after the
loan to the employee stock ownership plan and its purchase of Prudential Savings
Bank's common stock will be retained by Prudential Bancorp and will be available
for general corporate purposes. We may initially use the remaining net proceeds
to invest in deposits at Prudential Savings Bank, U.S. Government and federal
agency securities of various maturities, federal funds, mortgage-backed
securities, or a combination thereof. In addition, assuming shareholder approval
of our proposed stock recognition and retention plan in the year after the
reorganization is completed, we intend to contribute sufficient funds to the
trust so that it can purchase a number of shares equal to an aggregate of 4.00%
of the common stock sold in the offering. The net proceeds retained by
Prudential Bancorp may ultimately be used to:

      -     support the operations of Prudential Savings Bank after its
            reorganization;

      -     support possible additional future expansion of operations of
            Prudential Savings Bank through establishment of additional branch
            offices or other customer facilities, acquisition of other financial
            institutions or branch offices, expansion into other lending markets
            or diversification into other banking-related businesses, although
            no such transactions are specifically being considered at this time;

      -     invest in deposits at Prudential Savings Bank or securities; or

      -     fund repurchases of our common stock or serve as a source of
            possible payments of cash dividends to shareholders.

      Applicable regulations require us to sell common stock in the offering in
an amount equal to our estimated pro forma market value, as determined by an
independent appraisal. To the extent we have excess capital upon completion of
the reorganization, we intend to consider stock repurchases and dividends.
However, without non-objection from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
we cannot conduct any stock repurchases during the first year after we complete
the reorganization.

      As reflected in the table above, other than the proposed loan to fund our
employee stock ownership plan and the proposed purchase of shares for our
recognition and retention plan, we have not specifically identified how we will
use the bulk of the net proceeds from the offering. In addition, given that
Prudential Savings Bank is already considered well capitalized for regulatory
purposes, the bank does not necessarily need its portion of the net proceeds at
this time in order to continue its operations as currently conducted. We
determined to undertake the reorganization and offering at this time primarily
because of the advantages provided by the mutual holding company form of
organization rather than any specific need for additional capital. We believe
that the reorganization will facilitate our ability to
consider mergers and acquisitions with other institutions and companies,
although there are no current arrangements, understandings or agreements
regarding any such opportunities. Given the continuing consolidation in the
banking industry, we believe that it is important for us to maximize our ability
to consider opportunities to expand and diversify our operations, and the
reorganization will facilitate this by enhancing our capital base and providing
us with stock as a potential form of currency. In addition, the reorganization
will provide us with additional flexibility to undertake additional activities
through existing or newly formed subsidiaries and permit us greater access to
the capital markets in the future. In addition, the offering will permit us to
offer stock-based benefit plans as part of our compensation package. Finally,
the additional capital from the offering will permit us to make larger loans and
facilitate our ability to make additional investments in securities.

      Our net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the reorganization may
be more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds also will vary if the
number of shares to be issued in the offering is adjusted to reflect a change in
our estimated pro forma market value. Payments for shares purchased in the
subscription offering made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at
Prudential Savings Bank will not result in the receipt of new funds for
investment but will result in a reduction of Prudential Bancorp interest expense
and liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or
other deposit accounts."

common stock being offered hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts,
estimated offering expenses and the $10.0 million fee paid to the Sponsors for
terminating the management services agreements, will be approximately
$850.0 million based upon the $18 per share offering price. We intend to use:

        º approximately $265.0 million of the net proceeds to repay a portion of
          the outstanding borrowings under PanAmSat's Term Loan A Facility;

        º approximately $385.3 million of the net proceeds to voluntarily redeem
          $353.5 million, or 35%, of PanAmSat's $1,010 million aggregate
          principal amount of 9% senior notes and pay a related redemption
          premium thereon; and

        º $200.0 million of the net proceeds to pay a dividend that will be
          declared prior to the consummation of this offering and is payable
          promptly following the consummation of this offering to our existing
          stockholders. Our board of directors, which will declare this
          dividend, includes representatives of our existing stockholders who
          will receive the dividend. Investors in this offering will not receive
          any portion of the dividend.

    In addition, concurrently with this offering we intend to pay accrued
interest of approximately $12.0 million from cash on hand. We intend to use the
net proceeds from any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters' option to
purchase additional shares, less the underwriting discounts and commissions, to
repay additional borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility of up to
$103.5 million. Investors purchasing shares of our common stock in this offering
will not receive any dividends from the net proceeds from this offering.

    The borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility mature on August 20, 2009. The
borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility accrue interest, at PanAmSat's option,
at either adjusted LIBOR plus 2.50% each year or the alternate base rate plus
1.50% each year, with such applicable margins subject to reduction if PanAmSat
attains certain leverage ratios. As of December 31, 2004, the Term Loan A
Facility accrued interest at the rate of approximately 4.91% per year.

    PanAmSat's 9% senior notes accrue interest at 9% per year and mature on
August 15, 2014. None of the 9% senior notes to be redeemed with the proceeds of
this offering are held by any Sponsor, director or member of the Issuer's
management.

    The borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility and the proceeds received by
PanAmSat from the offering of the 9% senior notes were incurred in August 2004
and used, together with the proceeds from the Term Loan B facility, draws on the
Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand, as follows:

600,000 common shares by the selling shareholders or from the sale of 600,000
additional shares by the selling shareholders if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full.

    We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

        º approximately $8.0 million to build new production facilities in
          Shamir, Israel, which will focus mainly on the production of
          sophisticated plastic lenses using high index materials;

        º approximately $4.0 to $5.0 million to expand our marketing and
          distribution network in the United States;

        º approximately $2.0 to $3.0 million to expand our research and
          development team and facilities to enable us to develop new and
          advanced products, technologies and materials;

        º to pay a dividend payable of $5.2 million;

        º to repay outstanding indebtedness of $3.4 million;

        º to pursue possible acquisitions or strategic investments in
          laboratories in Europe and other complementary businesses,
          technologies or products;

        º to expand our marketing and distribution network in China and other
          parts of the world; and

        º to fund working capital requirements and other general corporate
          purposes.

    As part of our growth strategy, we seek to acquire independent laboratories
in Europe in order to strengthen our distribution network and to gain market
share. We may also acquire or invest in other businesses to support our
marketing and distribution efforts. We may pursue similar acquisitions or
investments in China. We continuously seek to identify companies as potential
objects of an acquisition, and we are currently investigating the possibility of
acquiring one of several potential candidates for an acquisition, but we have
not yet entered into any formal negotiations with any company regarding a
potential acquisition.

    As of September 30, 2004, we had $3.4 million in short- and long-term debt
at the parent-company level, consisting of twelve bank loans with interest rates
ranging from LIBOR plus 0.6% to LIBOR plus 1.5% and maturity dates ranging from
January 1, 2005 to September 1, 2008. Of this amount, $1.3 million relates to
debt that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of Cambridge Optical
Group Limited in September 2004. We expect to repay our corporate debt using the
proceeds from this offering.

    In August 2004 we declared a dividend to our shareholders in a total amount
of $9.2 million in order to take advantage of certain tax benefits for our
shareholders. We paid $4.0 million of this dividend to our shareholders on
December 1, 2004. The remaining $5.2 million was recorded on the liabilities
side of our balance sheet following this payment as a dividend payable. This
dividend payable bears no interest and will be distributed to our shareholders
in equal monthly installments until December 31, 2005 using the proceeds from
this offering. This distribution will be made to our existing shareholders in
proportion to their current shareholdings in our company.

    The amount and timing of the expenditures listed above may vary depending
upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the amount of cash we
generate from our operations. Our plans for each of the potential uses of the
proceeds from this offering are currently at an early stage. We have not yet
defined the precise actions, projects or procedures that will be necessary for
each potential use of these proceeds. Certain of these uses (such as for
acquisitions) will involve negotiations with
third parties that will determine the amounts allocated to that use, and the
final amounts could vary widely, depending on the results of the negotiations.
As a result, we cannot currently determine with certainty the amounts of
proceeds that will be allocated for each of the purposes stated above. While we
have estimated the amounts we expect to use for those purposes that we believe
are capable of estimation, approximately $17.5 million of the net proceeds is
not yet allocated to a specific purpose. Our management will have significant
discretion in the use of the net proceeds, particularly the unallocated funds,
and you may disagree with the way these funds are utilized. We may find it
necessary or advisable to use portions of the net proceeds for other purposes,
and we may apply the balance of the net proceeds in other ways than the ones
listed above. Until we use the proceeds of this offering for the above
purposes, we intend to invest the funds in short-term and medium-term
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

overallotment option is exercised in full, we estimate the net proceeds will be
approximately $81.7 million.

      We anticipate using the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

     •     approximately $14.0 million to commence our planned Phase III        
           clinical trial for the use of CellCept in the induction and          
           maintenance treatment of lupus nephritis;                            
    
     •     approximately $6.0 million to continue our Phase III clinical trial  
           for the use of CellCept to treat myasthenia gravis;                  
    
     •     approximately $5.0 million to continue our Phase III clinical trial  
           for the use of CellCept to treat pemphigus vulgaris; and             
    
     •     approximately $15.0 million to fund market research, continuing      
           medical education, medical liaisons and product launch preparation   
           for CellCept.                                                        


      We expect to use the balance of the net proceeds, together with our
available cash resources and revenues, if any, from our agreement with Roche, to
fund potential new formulations and additional potential indications of CellCept
and for working capital and general corporate purposes, including capital
expenditures.

      We may also use a portion of our available cash resources to acquire
rights to additional drugs and drug candidates through collaborations and for
the acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies or assets that
complement our technology or business strategy. However, we have no present
understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any potential
acquisitions, investments or collaborations at this time. We expect that the net
proceeds of this offering, together with our available cash resources, will be
sufficient to support our operations for at least the next twelve months.

      The amount and timing of our use of cash will depend on a number of
factors, including the status of our development and commercialization efforts,
the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering and the amount of
proceeds generated, if any, by entering into future collaborations. The ultimate
use of our cash may differ substantially from the estimated uses outlined above.
Pending the application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to
invest our available cash in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade
securities until it is used."

reorganization offering. The actual net proceeds will depend on the number of
shares of common stock sold in the reorganization offering, the actual expenses
of the reorganization offering and the merger and the number of Frankfort First
shareholders who elect to receive shares of Kentucky First common stock in the
merger. Payments for shares made through withdrawals from deposit accounts will
reduce our deposits and will not result in the receipt of new funds for
investment. See “Pro Forma Data” for the assumptions used to arrive at these
amounts.

(1)    Assumes that 49% of the shares issued are issued in the merger at the       
       minimum of the offering range and that 45% of the shares are issued in the  
       merger at the midpoint, maximum and maximum, as adjusted, of the offering   
       range.                                                                      
   
(2)    Based on 1,266,613 shares and options to acquire 147,230 shares of Frankfort
       First common stock outstanding on September 30, 2004. Subsequent to         
       September 30, 2004, an individual advised Frankfort First of such person’s  
       intent to exercise 12,368 options by tendering 5,000 shares of Frankfort    
       First common stock plus cash for the balance of the exercise price. This    
       transaction will nominally reduce the cash needed to complete the merger.   


   The cash proceeds we receive in the reorganization will not be sufficient to
pay the cash portion of the consideration in the merger. As a result, to pay the
merger consideration we expect to rely on a capital distribution from First
Federal of Hazard. We intend to make a capital distribution from First Federal
of Hazard to Kentucky First of between $4.1 million, assuming completion of the
offering at the maximum, as adjusted, of the offering range, and $14.9 million,
assuming completion of the offering at the minimum of the offering range. We
will use the net proceeds of the offering retained by Kentucky First plus the
proceeds of the capital distribution from First Federal of Hazard to Kentucy
First to acquire Frankfort First, fund our employee stock ownership plan and
capitalize First Federal MHC. Any remaining funds will be used to, among other
things, invest in securities, pay cash dividends or buy back shares of common
stock, subject to regulatory restrictions. We may also use funds at Kentucky
First to diversify our business and acquire other companies, although we have no
specific plans, other than the Frankfort First acquisition, to do so at this
time. For a further discussion on the relationship between our use of proceeds
and the offering range, see the table under “The Reorganization and Stock
Offering—How We Determined the Offering Range and the $10.00 Purchase Price.”

   Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the reorganization,
except to fund stock-based benefit plans or, with prior regulatory approval,
when extraordinary circumstances exist.

   We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed
above. We currently have no specific plans or agreements, other than the
Frankfort First acquisition, regarding any expansion activities or acquisitions.

   We do not have any other specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of
this reorganization offering."

approximately $72.0 million. The second lien loan has an interest rate that
adjusts according to changes in three-month LIBOR, a benchmark interest rate. As
of January 31, 2005, the interest rate for the second lien loan was 8.73% per

systems, construction of new gathering systems, acquisitions, and working
capital and general corporate purposes. We currently have no commitments or
specific plans for expansion of existing gathering systems, constructing new
gathering systems or making any new acquisition at this time, and have no

--------------------
(1)   This amount reflects $7.5 million held in a restricted cash account as      
      additional collateral for our existing revolving credit facility, which we  
      expect to be released to us after we enter into the new revolving credit    
      facility upon the completion of this offering. We do not expect the new     
      revolving credit facility to require any amounts to be held as cash         
      collateral. Additionally, such amount reflects $1.2 million in escrow,      
      representing security for workers’ compensation insurance, which will be    
      replaced by a letter of credit under the new revolving credit facility. 

(2)   Includes accrued and unpaid interest through the expected date of repurchase
      of the senior notes. At the closing of this offering, the amount due under  
      the senior notes will be placed in a restricted account held with the       
      administrative agent under the new revolving credit facility and paid upon  
      the expiration of the 15-day notice period beginning at the closing of this 
      offering. The senior notes bear interest at 15% per year and are due on June
      30, 2008. The aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that we will   
      repay as part of the Transactions includes all outstanding senior notes     
      issued as payment-in-kind for interest on the notes.                       

(3)   Represents the amount payable at the closing of this offering pursuant to   
      the rights to additional acquisition consideration, which includes a base   
      amount of additional consideration equal to $20.0 million plus an accreted  
      value that compounds at a rate of 10% annually.           

(4)   Includes 1,014 shares of our former parent company’s Series A voting        
      preferred stock that were issued upon full exercise of the 2004 Options     
      prior to the date of this prospectus. These shares were exchanged in the    
      merger with shares of our Series A voting preferred stock having identical  
      terms (except we changed the par value of our Series A voting preferred     
      stock and Series B non-voting preferred stock from $500 per share to $0.01  
      per share and we changed the liquidation preference of our Series A voting  
      preferred stock and Series B non-voting preferred stock to include the value
      of the accrued liquidation preference of our former parent company’s shares 
      of Series A voting preferred stock and Series B non-voting preferred stock).
      We intend to redeem all of the outstanding shares of our Series A voting    
      preferred stock and Series B non-voting preferred stock immediately         
      following the completion of this offering. Giving effect to the full        
      exercise of the 2004 Options and the subsequent exchange in the merger, as  
      of the closing of this offering, there will be 9,674 shares of our Series A 
      voting preferred stock and 3,840 shares of our Series B non-voting preferred
      stock outstanding. Each share of Series A voting preferred stock and Series 
      B non-voting preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $500 plus      
      accumulated and unpaid dividends. Holders of Series A voting preferred stock
      and Series B non-voting preferred stock are entitled to an annual cumulative
      dividend at a rate of 17% per share. As of the closing of this offering,    
      there will be $6.2 million of accumulated but unpaid dividends on our Series
      A voting preferred stock and Series B non-voting preferred stock, which     
      remained unpaid and are included in the liquidation preference of our Series
      A voting preferred stock and Series B non-voting preferred stock following  
      the exchange in the merger. We will pay this amount, plus additional        
      accumulated dividends since such date, when we redeem the Series A voting   
      preferred stock and Series B non-voting preferred stock. See “Description of
      capital stock—Preferred stock.” Approximately 97% of the Series A voting    
      preferred stock, representing an aggregate liquidation value, including     
      accumulated and unpaid dividends, of $8.9 million, and approximately 82% of 
      the Series B non-voting preferred stock, representing an aggregate          
      liquidation value, including accumulated and unpaid dividends, of $3.1      
      million, are held by our affiliates.                    

(5)   Includes a prepayment fee of $105,000 equal to 2% of the amount outstanding 
      under the term loan. Our subsidiary, JAC Operations, Inc., entered into this
      term loan in October 2003, with an original principal amount of $9.0        
      million, due on March 31, 2008, which we refer to as the term loan.         
      Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate based on    
      LIBOR, with a weighted average interest rate, as of December 31, 2004, of   
      6.78% per year. 

(6)   Includes accrued and unpaid interest through the expected date of repurchase
      of the industrial revenue bonds. At the closing of this offering, the amount
      that will be due under the industrial revenue bonds will be placed in a     
      restricted account with the administrative agent under the new revolving    
      credit facility and paid upon the expiration of the notice period of up to  
      90 days beginning at the closing of this offering. The variable rate demand 
      industrial development revenue bonds due 2010 with an original principal    
      amount of $5.3 million, which we refer to as the industrial revenue bonds,  
      were issued by our subsidiary Freight Car Services, Inc. The industrial     
      revenue bonds bear interest at a weekly variable rate, which was 2.15% as of
      December 31, 2004 and are subject to a weekly “put” provision by the holders
      of the bonds. 

(7)   This amount reflects the payments in connection with the termination of     
      certain management services and other agreements with certain of our        
      stockholders. 

(8)   This amount reflects the underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and
      expenses related to the offering, net of $2.0 million in fees and expenses  
      related to the offering which we have paid prior to December 31, 2004."

repurchasing shares of our common stock. Brooklyn Federal Savings Bank may use

$55.8 million, or $64.4 million if the offering range is increased by 15.0%. 
We intend to use the net proceeds for the cash merger consideration portion of 
the acquisition of Chart Bank, approximately $21,469,000 assuming that the 
Chart Bank options are cashed out at the closing rather than being exercised by 
optionees prior to the closing and netting out the tax benefit of such option 
cash out. We also intend to use the net proceeds for a loan to the employee 
stock ownership plan to fund its purchase of shares of common stock, between 
$3.7 million and $4.9 million, or $5.6 million if the offering is increased by 
15.0%. Of the net proceeds remaining, we intend to retain at the parent-company 
level between $10.9 million and $20.8 million of the net proceeds, or $26.6 
million if the offering range is increased by 15.0%, and to invest in Benjamin 
Franklin Bank approximately $4.9 million to $8.6 million of the net proceeds, 
or $10.7 million if the offering range is increased by 15.0%. Benjamin Franklin 
Bancorp may use the funds to pay cash dividends, repurchase shares of common 
stock and for general corporate purposes. Funds invested in Benjamin Franklin 
Bank will be used to support increased lending and new products and services. 
We may also use the net proceeds for future business expansion by establishing 
new branches or by acquiring branches or other whole banks. Initially, a 
substantial portion of the net proceeds could be used to pay down certain 
Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston borrowings, as well as invested in short-term 
investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities."

of the shares of common stock offered by us in this offering, after deducting
the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised
in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $72,284,421. We
will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by
the selling stockholders.

    The principal purposes for this offering are to increase our working
capital, create a public market for our common stock, facilitate our future
access to the public capital markets and increase our visibility in our markets.
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital,
expansion of our operations, investment in new product development and strategic
initiatives, including spending an estimated $2.5 to $3 million in capital
expenditures in 2005. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to partially fund
the anticipated increase in our sales and marketing, technology and general and
administrative operating expenses, including an estimated $2 million in expenses
in 2005 related to public company costs. We may also use a portion of the net
proceeds to pursue acquisition candidates to grow our advertising and publishing
base and access technology and talent. However, we have no present
understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of
other businesses or technologies.

    We have not yet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and therefore
cannot estimate the amounts to be used for all of the purposes discussed above.
The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and
the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will
have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds from this offering. Pending
the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

After deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and estimated expenses

We will contribute the net proceeds from this offering and, on a pro forma
basis, $4.5 million of borrowings under the credit facility we intend to enter
into after the closing of the offering to our operating partnership. Our
operating partnership intends to use the net proceeds received from us as
follows:

    •    approximately $193.8 million to fund a portion of the purchase of the     
         Capital Hotel Investment Portfolio and the Vail Marriott Mountain Resort &
         Spa (we intend to fund the balance of the purchase price for these        
         properties through two mortgage loans secured by first mortgage liens on  
         the Marriott Los Angeles Airport and Renaissance Worthington hotels       
         aggregating $140.0 million and bearing interest at 5.38% and 5.48%,       
         respectively (provided we close on the mortgage financing on or before    
         July 6, 2005), and available corporate cash);                             

    •    approximately $64.0 million to repay the following indebtedness at the    
         time this indebtedness becomes prepayable without penalty;                

    •    approximately $20.0 million of debt that bears interest at LIBOR plus  
         2.40%, which may be prepaid without penalty in October 2005 and matures
         in November 2006, incurred in connection with the acquisition of The   
         Lodge at Sonoma Renaissance Resort & Spa (such debt was incurred with  
         Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate of Banc of America Securities LLC, 
         a co-managing underwriter of this offering, as lender); and            

    •    approximately $44.0 million of senior and subordinated debt that bears 
         interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%, which may be prepaid without penalty     
         prior to July 13, 2005 and matures in January 2007, incurred in        
         connection with the acquisition of Torrance Marriott.                  

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing,
short-term investment grade securities or money-market accounts that are
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. Such investments may
include, for example, government and government agency certificates,
interest-bearing bank deposits and mortgage loan participation.

The closings of the acquisitions of the Capital Hotel Investment Portfolio and
the Vail Marriott Mountain Resort & Spa and the senior secured revolving credit
facility are scheduled to occur after the completion of this offering. There can
be no assurance that we will acquire any of these properties or that we will
close on such credit facility."

controlling stockholders have not received any cash dividends or other
distributions in respect of their equity interests other than a special dividend

of 3,350,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting
underwriting discounts and structuring fees but before paying estimated offering

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with proceeds of
approximately $7.9 million from the separate private placement of 450,000
subordinated units to an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. and
borrowings of approximately $31.5 million under our new credit facility, to:

   º pay $101.9 million in cash to TransMontaigne Inc.;

   º pay $3.2 million of expenses associated with the offering and related
     formation transactions; and

   º pay $1.0 million of deferred debt issuance costs incurred in connection
     with our new credit facility.

The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option
will be used to redeem from TransMontaigne Inc. a number of common units equal
to the number of common units issued upon exercise of the over-allotment option,
at a price per common unit equal to the proceeds per common unit before expenses

(1) Borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan facility will   
    bear interest, at our option, at either (a) LIBOR plus the applicable margin 
    or (b) the Euribor rate plus the applicable margin, in each case in addition 
    to certain other mandatory costs associated with syndication in the European 
    markets. The applicable margin for US Dollar LIBOR term loans will be 2.00%  
    and the applicable margin for LIBOR revolving loans, Euribor loans and CDOR  
    loans will be 2.25%, provided that the applicable margin with respect to     
    revolving loans may be reduced to 2.00% or 1.75% based on a leverage test set
    forth in the new credit agreement. After the completion of the offering, we  
    intend to enter into interest rate swap contracts that we expect will, based 
    on current market rates for such agreements, effectively fix the interest    
    rate on 85% of the term loan credit facility for three years at a weighted   
    average rate of 5.67%. We estimate that the interest rates on the revolving  
    credit facility and the portion of the term loan facility not effectively    
    fixed by interest rate swap contracts, based on the 90-day LIBOR, will be    
    5.24% based on current market rates.                                         


(2) The amount of indebtedness shown above is the aggregate gross amount of each 
    category of indebtedness listed below as of March 31, 2005 less $6.3 million 
    of cash we will have on hand immediately prior to the offering that we have  
    allocated for the repayment of indebtedness. Such indebtedness includes:     

    †   An aggregate of $589.6 million of principal outstanding and $2.6 million of
        accrued interest on our existing senior credit facility composed as        
        follows: $263.4 million of principal under the tranche A term loan at      
        current interest rates ranging from 4.35% to 4.92% depending upon the      
        underlying currency, due in 2009; $157.9 million of principal under the    
        tranche B term loan at current interest rates ranging from 4.85% to 5.42%  
        depending upon the underlying currency, due in 2010; and $168.3 million of 
        principal under the tranche C term loan at current interest rates ranging  
        from 5.35% to 5.92% depending upon the underlying currency, due in 2011.   


    †   An aggregate of $80.4 million of principal outstanding on our existing     
        mezzanine credit facility, and accrued interest of $3.2 million, at a      
        current interest rate of 16.0% due in 2013, and an additional $82.1 million
        principal amount outstanding on the portion of our existing mezzanine      
        credit facility denominated in Euros, and accrued interest of $2.7 million,
        at a current interest rate of 13.2%, due in 2013.                          

(3) Following the completion of the offering, we will redeem 404,505 shares of   
    common stock from certain of our directors and members of senior management  
    at a price per share equal to the price per share of common stock sold in    
    this offering less the underwriting discount, pursuant to certain exchange   
    and recapitalization agreements, as described in “The Transactions—The       
    Recapitalization and the Offering” and “Related Party Transactions—Proceeds  
    from the Recapitalization and the Offering.” A majority of the proceeds will 
    be used to satisfy certain taxes such directors and members of senior        
    management will incur by reason of our recapitalization in connection with   
    this offering.

    approximately $13.1 million payable to the arrangers and lenders under our   
    new credit facility and approximately $15.8 million in other fees and        
    expenses.

    and to fund certain expenses in connection with the offering expected to be  
    incurred by Xerium 3 S.A., Xerium 2 S.A. and Xerium S.A. following the       
    consummation of the offering.                                                

(6) Represents the aggregate amount of transaction bonuses that will be paid to  
    certain members of management for completing this offering.                  

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by
Xerium 3 S.A. if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option. Xerium 3
S.A will receive approximately $22.6 million of net proceeds from this offering
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full. The net
proceeds from the sale of shares by Xerium 3 S.A. will be distributed or
otherwise paid to, or at the direction of, the existing equity investors who
indirectly hold the economic rights to such shares through their ownership
interests in Xerium 3 S.A.’s indirect parent company, Xerium S.A., including

          a termination fee to Blackstone Management Partners IV L.L.C. in
          connection with the anticipated termination of the transaction and
          monitoring fee agreement.

    Our board of directors, which will declare this $43.2 million dividend,
includes representatives of our existing shareholders who will receive the
dividend. Investors in this offering will not receive any portion of the
dividend.

    We intend to use the proceeds from any shares sold pursuant to the
underwriters' over-allotment option to pay a dividend to existing shareholders.
Additionally, if the underwriters exercise their over- allotment option, our
optionholders will receive approximately $4.3 million from cash on hand
(including approximately $3.1 million to our named executive officers) and
options to acquire up to the equivalent of 74,766 shares of our common stock
(net of any exercise cost) (including 54,729 shares to our named executive
officers). Some of these options will vest upon issuance and be immediately
exercisable, allowing our optionholders to acquire up to the equivalent of
38,541 shares of our common stock (net of any exercise cost) (including 28,212
shares to our named executive officers). If the underwriters do not exercise
their over-allotment option, we will grant options to our optionholders that
immediately convert to the equivalent of 144,419 shares of our common stock (net
of any exercise cost) (including 105,715 shares to our named executive
officers).

    The $43.2 million dividend will be routed through our subsidiaries via
contributions and upstream loans in order to allow us to potentially take the
position that we comply with certain ""thin capitalization"" thresholds that are
applicable for Dutch and Luxembourg tax purposes. We currently have various
intercompany loans relating to the efficient funding of the Acquisition and as a
result of converting the ownership structure of the investment funds to a more
flexible structure before this offering. These intercompany loans are used to
facilitate an efficient mechanism for moving funds from our operating company,
New Skies Satellites B.V., to the Issuer.

    The borrowings under the term loan facility mature in May 2011. The
borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest, at our subsidiary's
option, at either adjusted LIBOR plus 2.75% each year or the alternate base rate
plus 1.5% each year. As of March 31, 2005, the term loan facility accrued
interest at the rate of approximately 5.22% per year. In February 2005, we
repaid $88.8 million under the term loan facility and reduced the applicable
margins on our subsidiary's borrowings from 2.75% to 2.50% and from 1.5% to
1.25% for Eurodollar and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively.

    The borrowings incurred in November 2004 by New Skies Satellites B.V. under
the term loan facility and the proceeds received in November 2004 by New Skies
Satellites B.V. from the offering of the notes were used, together with the 
proceeds from New Skies Holding B.V.'s loan and contributed equity to New Skies 
Satellites B.V., and cash on hand, as follows:

        º approximately $958.0 million to purchase substantially all of Seller's
          assets and liabilities; and

        º approximately $57.8 million to pay transaction fees and expenses.

    In connection with this offering, we intend to amend the senior secured
credit facilities to, among other things, permit greater availability for the
payment of dividends under the restricted payments covenant. The amendment of 
the senior secured credit facilities and this offering are conditioned upon 
each other."

of the shares of our common stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, our net proceeds will be
approximately $165.3 million. We will use the net proceeds from this offering to
repay our indebtedness to Comstock. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised, we will use the net proceeds from such exercise to repay
indebtedness under our new bank credit facility and the remainder, if any, for
general corporate purposes.

    We incurred $152.4 million of indebtedness to Comstock in connection with
our formation under a $200.0 million revolving line of credit. As of April 30,
2005, we had an outstanding balance of $158.0 million. The indebtedness is
secured by a second priority lien on certain of our and our subsidiaries’
assets, and bears interest at our option at LIBOR plus 2% or the base rate
(which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate) plus 0.75% per
annum. The revolving line of credit matures on April 1, 2006. Funds under the
revolving line of credit were used to refinance indebtedness assumed with
respect to properties contributed in our formation, to pay the acquisition costs
with respect to such properties and for general corporate purposes.

    We will enter into a new $175.0 million bank credit facility with The Bank
of Nova Scotia and several other banks at the closing of this offering. The new
credit facility will provide a four-year revolving credit commitment. The
indebtedness under the new credit facility will be limited to a borrowing base
that will initially be set at $100.0 million. Indebtedness under the new credit
facility will be secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries’
assets and will be guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries.

    We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock offered by
the selling stockholder."

deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by
us, will be approximately US$89.1 million, based on the offering price of
US$16.25 per ADS. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs
by the selling shareholders.

      The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for
our ordinary shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented
employees by providing them with equity incentives, fund proposed capital
expenditures, raise capital and for other business purposes. We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

     •     approximately $45.0 million to expand our research and development   
           efforts, such as building a state-of-the-art research laboratory for 
           developing mobile handsets using emerging technical standards,       
           particularly CDMA 2000, CDMA-EVDO and WCDMA, and smart phones, and an
           advanced testing laboratory;                                         
    
     •     approximately $15.0 million to acquire new premises in Beijing to    
           build a dedicated research and development center and a mobile       
           handset pilot production facility;                                   
    
     •     approximately $5.0 million to expand our selling and marketing       
           activities and establish overseas offices in Asia, Europe and the    
           United States; and                                                   
    
     •     the balance to fund working capital and for other general corporate  
           purposes, including funding further strategic alliances with wireless
           technology providers and key component suppliers as well as possible 
           strategic acquisitions of quality mobile handset design houses that  
           could complement our existing capabilities and business, although we 
           are not currently negotiating any such transactions.                 


      We have not yet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and
therefore cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes
discussed above. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending
on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological
developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our
management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the
offering.

      Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to place our net proceeds in
short-term bank deposits."

offering will be approximately $29.7 million, after deducting underwriting

shareholders.

     We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash
flow from operations, to fund new store openings, store improvements,
infrastructure improvements, working capital and other general corporate
purposes, which may include general and administrative expenses. For fiscal
2005, we have budgeted $14.8 million for new store openings and store
improvements and $0.9 million for infrastructure improvements, although the
actual amounts that we spend on such items may vary. As a result, we will retain
broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering. In that
regard, we consider possible acquisitions of other businesses and stores from
time to time and we may therefore apply a portion of the net proceeds to finance
all or a portion of the cost of acquisitions. However, we do not currently have
any binding agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisitions, and we
might be required to obtain additional financing if we were to proceed with an
acquisition. Pending application, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities or money
market accounts.

     The principal purposes of this offering are (1) to provide additional funds
for the purposes described above, (2) to attract and retain qualified employees

will ultimately be used by Lazard Group primarily to redeem membership interests
held by the historical partners for an aggregate redemption price of
approximately $1.6 billion.  In addition,approximately $83 million of additional 
net proceeds will be transferred to LAZ-MD Holdings and approximately $67 million 
will be transferred to LFCM Holdings. These funds will be available to fund the 
operating requirements of the separated businesses, as well as LAZ-MD Holdings’ 
obligation to redeem its capital interests over time pursuant to the terms of 
the retention agreements with our managing directors and the managing directors 
of LFCM Holdings and for general corporate purposes. The remaining amount of net 
proceeds, including any net proceeds that may be received as a result of the 
exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, will be retained by Lazard 
Group for its general corporate purposes, including the expected repayment of 
$50 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.53% Senior Notes due 2011 issued 
by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lazard Group.

Based upon the initial public offering price of $25.00 per share of common
stock, we will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $789
million (or $911 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised
in full), after deducting approximately $66 million in underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated expenses payable in connection with this offering.

Lazard Ltd will contribute, indirectly through our wholly-owned subsidiaries,
all of the net proceeds of this offering to Lazard Group in exchange for the
issuance of Lazard Group common membership interests. The price of each of the
Lazard Group common membership interests that we acquire will equal the amount
of net proceeds per share received by Lazard Ltd. Lazard Group will, in turn,
use the net proceeds as described above. Such Lazard Group common membership
interests, including those acquired in connection with the IXIS investment
agreement and the cashless exchange of the Lazard Group historical partner
interests of our Chief Executive Officer, will result in our ownership of 37.5%
of the outstanding Lazard Group common membership interests (or a total of 40.5%
of the outstanding Lazard Group common membership interests, assuming that the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), and a controlling
interest in Lazard Group.

relating to this offering and the additional financing transactions, assuming
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised in the offering, and

selling shareholder. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be
approximately $18.2 million, based on our initial public offering price of
$18.50 per share, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use any net proceeds to us from the exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment option for general corporate purposes, including working capital.
We do not have more specific plans for any net proceeds to us from this
offering. We may seek to acquire, invest in, or establish joint ventures with
respect to businesses, products, services, or technologies that complement or
expand our existing business, and we may use a portion of any net proceeds for
such acquisitions, investments, or joint ventures. We do not, however, have any
present arrangements, understandings, or agreements with respect to any such

$5.7 million, or $6.6 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions of
approximately $560,000, or $644,000 if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, and estimated offering expenses payable by us of
approximately $715,000 or $768,000 if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

   •  approximately $1.5 million to implement a branded sales and marketing       
      campaign designed to increase our brand awareness in existing markets,      
      including targeting Hispanic consumers throughout the United States;        
                                                                             
   •  approximately $800,000 to purchase additional equipment for our La Junta,   
      Colorado facility that will allow us to increase production and expand our  
      product offerings on the West Coast;                                        
                                                                             
   •  approximately $500,000 to grow our food service distribution both           
      organically and through acquisitions; and                                   
                                                                                  
   •  the remaining $2.9 million for general corporate purposes, including working
      capital and capital expenditures and, as strategic opportunities arise, to  
      fund acquisitions, licensing and other strategic alliances.                 

The foregoing represents our best estimate of our allocation of the net proceeds
of this offering. This estimate is based on certain assumptions related to our
sales and marketing activities, the growth of our business, competition and
other factors. In addition, although we have no present plans or intentions, as
strategic opportunities arise, we may use a portion of the proceeds of this
offering to fund future acquisitions, licensing and other strategic alliances.
Future events, as well as changes in economic or competitive conditions or our
business and the results of our sales and marketing activities and growth of our
business, may make shifts in the allocation of funds necessary or desirable.

A substantial portion of the net proceeds will be reserved for general corporate
purposes. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of this
portion of the net proceeds. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in direct and guaranteed obligations of the United States,
interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments or certificates of deposit."

(1)               A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
                  funds we received from TerraNova Partners L.P. described below.
                  These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
                  not being placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.

$24,816,000, or $28,648,800 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to TerraNova Management Corp., an affiliate of Vahan Kololian, our
chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Lee W. Chung, our chief
financial officer and member of our board of directors, and Jesse Gill, our vice
president and member of our board of directors, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by TerraNova Management
Corp. for our benefit and is not intended to provide Messrs. Kololian, Chung or
Gill compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the Toronto, Ontario area, that the fee charged by TerraNova
Management Corp. is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated
person. Upon completion of a business combination or our liquidation, we will no
longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $358,000 or $475,600
if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for director and officer
liability insurance premiums (approximately $80,000) with the balance of
$278,000, or $395,600 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, being
held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as
well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

TerraNova Partners L.P., one of our stockholders and an affiliate of Messrs.
Kololian, Chung and Gill, has advanced to us a total of $90,000 which was used
to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items
above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and
expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of November
24, 2005 or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of
the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay TerraNova Management Corp.
the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business
combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

We intend to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering primarily

in management’s estimation continued research and development expenditures in
the amount of at least NT$100 million (US$3.2 million) in each of 2005, 2006,
and 2007. The amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a
number of factors, including the amount of cash generated by our operations,
competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of
our business. While we have no specific plans for any remaining proceeds, we may
also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, products and
technologies or to establish joint ventures that we believe will complement our
current or future business. However, we have no specific plans, agreements or
commitments to do so and are not currently engaged in any negotiations for any
acquisition or joint venture.

receive from this offering in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade

favorable return.

(1)
   º A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
     received from Messrs. Berrard, Kramer, Aucamp and The Edelson Family Trust
     described below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this
     offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.

    $109,800,000, or $126,720,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds held in trust will not be released from
the trust fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

    We have agreed to pay SB Management Corp., a corporation owned and managed
by Steven R. Berrard, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, approximately
$4,875 per month for office space and certain other additional services. In
addition, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of I. Steven Edelson, our Vice
Chairman and Vice President, and Nathaniel Kramer, one of our directors,
approximately $2,625 per month for general and administrative services including
secretarial support. We have agreed to pay up to a monthly maximum of $7,500 for
all of the foregoing services. This arrangement is being agreed to by SB
Management Corp. and the affiliate of Mr. Edelson and Mr. Kramer for our benefit
and is not intended to provide Messrs. Berrard, Edelson or Kramer compensation
in lieu of a salary. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business 
combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay these 
monthly fees.

    We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $790,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $60,000), with
the balance of $730,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We expect that due diligence of
prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers
and directors and may include engaging market research firms and/or third party
consultants. Our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection
with such due diligence activities. We believe that the excess working capital
will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

    It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working
capital to make a deposit, down payment or fund a ""no-shop"" provision with
respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to
forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating
to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working
capital available outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay
other expenses related to finding another suitable business combination without
securing additional financing. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the
allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

    As of the date of this prospectus, Steven R. Berrard, our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and our directors I. Steven Edelson and Nathaniel Kramer,
have advanced to us a total of $90,000 which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. Of such
loans, $40,000 will be payable with 4% annual interest on the earlier of
January 24, 2006 or the consummation of this offering and $50,000 will be
payable with 4% interest on the earlier of March 28, 2006 or the consummation of
the offering. In addition, Mr. Edelson and Mr. Aucamp loaned us an aggregate of
$70,000 on June 29, 2005 to be used to pay the fees of the American Stock
Exchange. Such amount shall be repaid at the closing of this offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
Treasury Bills issued by the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less
or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. The interest income derived
from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative fees described
above, no compensation of any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will
be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that
such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust fund,
such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a
business combination. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination
within the allotted time or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert
such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust fund."

   º A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
     received from Messrs. Berrard, Kramer, Aucamp and The Edelson Family Trust
     described below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this
     offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.

    $109,800,000, or $126,720,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds held in trust will not be released from
the trust fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

    We have agreed to pay SB Management Corp., a corporation owned and managed
by Steven R. Berrard, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, approximately
$4,875 per month for office space and certain other additional services. In
addition, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of I. Steven Edelson, our Vice
Chairman and Vice President, and Nathaniel Kramer, one of our directors,
approximately $2,625 per month for general and administrative services including
secretarial support. We have agreed to pay up to a monthly maximum of $7,500 for
all of the foregoing services. This arrangement is being agreed to by SB
Management Corp. and the affiliate of Mr. Edelson and Mr. Kramer for our benefit
and is not intended to provide Messrs. Berrard, Edelson or Kramer compensation
in lieu of a salary. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business 
combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay these 
monthly fees.

    We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $790,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $60,000), with
the balance of $730,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We expect that due diligence of
prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers
and directors and may include engaging market research firms and/or third party
consultants. Our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection
with such due diligence activities. We believe that the excess working capital
will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

    It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working
capital to make a deposit, down payment or fund a ""no-shop"" provision with
respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to
forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating
to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working
capital available outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay
other expenses related to finding another suitable business combination without
securing additional financing. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the
allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

    As of the date of this prospectus, Steven R. Berrard, our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and our directors I. Steven Edelson and Nathaniel Kramer,
have advanced to us a total of $90,000 which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. Of such
loans, $40,000 will be payable with 4% annual interest on the earlier of
January 24, 2006 or the consummation of this offering and $50,000 will be
payable with 4% interest on the earlier of March 28, 2006 or the consummation of
the offering. In addition, Mr. Edelson and Mr. Aucamp loaned us an aggregate of
$70,000 on June 29, 2005 to be used to pay the fees of the American Stock
Exchange. Such amount shall be repaid at the closing of this offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
Treasury Bills issued by the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less
or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. The interest income derived
from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative fees described
above, no compensation of any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will
be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that
such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust fund,
such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a
business combination. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination
within the allotted time or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert
such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust fund."

2  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received
   from Charles Royce, one of our initial stockholders, as described below. These
   funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in
   trust upon consummation of this offering.

We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or more
operating businesses in the technology-related sector.

Of the net proceeds, $109,900,000, or $126,820,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in a trust account at
The Bank of New York. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target businesses.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $660,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $110,000), with
the balance of $550,000 being held in reserve for other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations, including the
making of a down payment or the payment of exclusivity or similar fees and
expenses, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
our initial stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. Of that amount, we have reserved approximately $100,000 for
reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with conducting due diligence
reviews of prospective target businesses. We expect that due diligence of
prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers
and directors, and may include engaging market research and valuation firms, as
well as other third party consultants. None of our officers or directors will
receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while
performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. We believe that the
excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and
reimbursement costs.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is
less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event, the
proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target businesses, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.

Mr. Royce, one of our initial stockholders, has advanced to us through a loan a
total of approximately $150,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses
of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee,
NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loan will be payable
without interest on the earlier of March 14, 2006 or the consummation of this
offering. The loan will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not
being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested in a money market fund, selected by
us, which invests principally in short-term securities issued or guaranteed by
the United States having a rating in the highest investment category granted
thereby by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition, so that
we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940. The interest income derived from investment of the net proceeds not
held in trust during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 18 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time. However, the report of
Eisner LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, contains a going
concern qualification.

No compensation of any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our initial stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our initial stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business
combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such shares
into cash in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder
previously voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $72.4 million, or
approximately $80.4 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from the sale of the shares offered by the selling stockholders.

    We intend to use $20.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to
distribute our estimated undistributed S corporation earnings to our existing
stockholders and approximately $4.0 million to develop our infrastructure in
Europe. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for facility upgrades,
marketing and advertising, enhancing and deploying our in-store marketing
displays for our retailers, and working capital and other general corporate
purposes. Although we have no current agreements or commitments with respect to
any acquisition, we may, if we identify an attractive opportunity, use a portion
of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in products or companies.

    The principal purposes of this offering are (1) to provide additional funds
for the purposes described above, (2) to attract and retain qualified employees
and consultants by providing them with equity incentives, and (3) to create a
public market for our common stock for the benefit of our current stockholders.

    Our management will have significant discretion and flexibility in applying
the net proceeds of this offering. The timing and amount of our actual
expenditures will depend on numerous factors including the amount of cash
generated by our operations. The foregoing intended uses of proceeds from this
offering reflect our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business condition.

    Until the funds are used as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of the offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade
securities. We cannot predict whether our investment of the net proceeds will
yield a favorable return."

the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full. In each case, this
assumes the deduction of estimated offering expenses of $1.2 million in addition
to underwriting discounts and commissions. We expect that we will retain
approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds at Western Alliance and
contribute the remaining proceeds to the Banks. By increasing the Banks’
capital, the Banks will be permitted to expand their deposit and lending
portfolios. 

    The proceeds retained by Western Alliance will be used for general corporate
purposes, including but not limited to, the formation of additional de novo
banks in new market areas with attractive growth prospects, the acquisition of
other commercial banks or financial services companies and the development of
additional products or services for new and existing customers. We have no
present understandings or agreements or definitive plans concerning any specific
acquisitions."

          interests in the entity that owns the property with a principal amount  
          outstanding of approximately $4.3 million, a variable interest rate     
          floating at LIBOR plus 4.5% and a maturity date of May 1, 2006. The     
          lender is Wachovia Capital Investments, Inc., an affiliate of Wachovia  
          Capital Markets, LLC, our lead underwriter; and

       99% of the outstanding stock of a private REIT that will own the Barlow     
       Building property from unaffiliated third parties;                          
   
    •  up to $1.0 million to fund an equity contribution to a new joint venture, in
       which we will own up to an approximately 14.7% interest, that we expect to  
       develop an approximately 115,000 square foot office building on a parcel

    •  the balance for general corporate and working capital purposes, including   
       possible future acquisitions and development activities.                    

    Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net offering proceeds in
interest-bearing, short-term, marketable investment grade securities or money
market accounts which are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT.
These investments may include, for example, government and government agency
securities, certificates of deposit, interest-bearing bank deposits and mortgage
loan participations.

    The closings of the acquisitions of the Suffolk Building and Barlow Building
properties are scheduled to occur after the completion of this offering. There
can be no assurance that we will acquire either of these properties.

    The price to be paid to Clark/Carr Investments for our acquisition of
interests in the Fair Oaks, Meadows IV, Madison Place and Victory Point
properties was determined by negotiation among Carr Capital, Clark/Carr
Investments and other third party investors in these properties. Because one of
our directors, Ms. Owen, holds a 5% ownership interest in Clark/Carr
Investments, the terms may not have been negotiated on an arms’ length basis."

Common Shares we are offering will be $241.5 million, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and offering expenses. If the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimated that the net proceeds
will be $278.8 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
offering expenses.

    We intend to use the net proceeds:
   •  to repay $190.0 million of intercompany indebtedness owed to Retail         
      Ventures, plus the accrued interest related thereto, which was $2.7 million 
      as of April 30, 2005; and

indebtedness is evidenced by a note which is scheduled to mature in March 2020
and bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 850 basis points per year. As
of April 30, 2005, the interest rate was 11.2%. The $25.0 million of
indebtedness is evidenced by a note which is scheduled to mature in May 2020 and
bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 950 basis points per year. Had this
note been outstanding as of April 30, 2005, the interest rate would have been

Of the net proceeds we will receive in this offering, we expect to use
approximately:

    •   $12.0 million of the net proceeds for sales and marketing initiatives to   
        support the ongoing commercialization of our INRatio System;               

    •   $1.7 million for research and development activities, including support of 
        product development, regulatory and clinical study initiatives; and

        promissory notes bearing interest at the rate of 6% annually held by       
        affiliates, plus accrued interest. These promissory notes will become due

        notes upon the closing of the initial public offering. The proceeds from   
        the promissory notes are being used for working capital and general        
        corporate purposes. 

We intend to use the remainder of our net proceeds for working capital and
general corporate purposes. We believe that the net proceeds of this offering
will be sufficient to fund our operations as currently conducted and as proposed
to be conducted over at least the next 12 months. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon numerous factors,
including the progress of our research, development and commercialization
efforts, and our operating costs and capital expenditures. Accordingly, we will
retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering,
and we reserve the right to change the specific allocation of use of these
proceeds within the categories described above as a result of contingencies such
as the progress and results of our research and development activities, the
results of our commercialization efforts, competitive developments and our
manufacturing requirements. Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering,
we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

common stock in this offering of approximately $53.4 million, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate
that our net proceeds will be approximately $61.7 million.

We will use approximately $28.6 million of the estimated net proceeds of this
offering to pay part of the consideration for the redemption of all of the
outstanding shares of our series A preferred stock and approximately $11.4
million of the estimated net proceeds of this offering to pay part of the
consideration for the redemption of all of the shares of our series B preferred
stock.

We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds of this offering for general
corporate purposes, including working capital. We believe opportunities may
exist to expand the international distribution and sale of our solutions and to
expand our current business through strategic acquisitions and investments in
technology, and we may use a portion of the proceeds for these purposes. We have
not yet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and cannot estimate the
amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above. We presently have
no commitment or agreement relating to any acquisitions or to expand our
operations into any other country. We are not currently a party to any contracts
or letters of intent, nor do we have any arrangements or understandings, with
respect to any strategic acquisitions or investments. The amounts and timing of
any expenditure will vary depending on the amount of cash generated by our
operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth,
if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion
in applying the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. We cannot
predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return."

We intend to retain between $77.3 million and $104.8 million of the net
proceeds, or $120.6 million if the offering range is increased by 15%, and we
intend to utilize these funds as follows. First, we will retire $30.0 million of

wholly owned subsidiary, Success National Bank, and our 2003 redemption of trust
preferred securities acquired in that acquisition. The term debt matures on June
30, 2005, and carries an adjustable interest rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 200 basis
points (4.02% at December 31, 2004). Second, between $12.6 million and $17.0
million (or $19.6 million if the offering range is increased) will be used for
the loan to the employee stock ownership plan to fund its purchase of shares of
common stock. Third, we will retain the remainder of the net proceeds of between
$34.7 million and $57.8 million, or $71.1 million if the offering range is
increased by 15%, and may use it for a variety of purposes, including those

(1) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares which could
    occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand for the  
    shares, changes in market or general financial conditions following the      
    commencement of the offering, or regulatory considerations.                  


Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but
will result in a reduction of BankFinancial, F.S.B.’s deposits. The net proceeds
may vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be more or less
than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a syndicated
community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not purchased in the
subscription and community offerings.

 
BankFinancial Corporation May Use the Proceeds it Retains From the Offering:

    •    to repay $30.0 million in term debt, discussed above, that we incurred as 
         part of our acquisition of Success Bancshares and our redemption of trust 
         preferred securities assumed in that acquisition;                         

    •    to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares of 
         common stock in the offering (between $12.6 million and $17.0 million, or 
         $19.6 million if the offering is increased by 15%);                       

    •    to invest in debt securities issued by the United States government and   
         United States government-sponsored agencies or entities;                  

    •    to finance the acquisition of financial institutions or other financial   
         service companies;                                                        

  •   to pay cash dividends to stockholders;

  •   to repurchase shares of our common stock; and

  •   for other general corporate purposes.

Initially, we intend to invest a substantial portion of the net proceeds in
short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed
securities.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the conversion,
except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory
approval.
 

BankFinancial, F.S.B. May Use the Net Proceeds it Receives From the Offering:

    •    to expand its retail and commercial banking franchise by acquiring other  
         financial institutions or other financial services companies, or by       
         acquiring or establishing new branches;                                   

    •    to fund new loans, including multi-family mortgage and nonresidential real
         estate and land loans, construction loans, commercial loans and leases and
         single-family residential mortgage loans;                                 

    •    to enhance existing products and services and to support new products and 
         services;                                                                 

    •    to establish off-site ATMs;

    •    to invest in debt securities issued by the United States government and   
         United States government-sponsored agencies or entities; and              

    •   for other general corporate purposes.

Our short-term and long-term growth plans anticipate that, upon completion of
the offering, we will experience measured growth through increased lending and
investment activities, limited de novo branching and, possibly, acquisitions,
with a particular emphasis on attempting to stimulate internal loan growth
through the hiring of additional individuals experienced in the origination of
commercial, commercial real estate and multifamily loans using targeted
marketing efforts. We plan to explore acquisition opportunities involving other
banks and thrifts, and possibly financial service companies, when and as they
arise as a means of supplementing internal growth, filling gaps in our current
geographic footprint and expanding our customer base, product lines and internal
capabilities. We may also consider establishing de novo branches or acquiring
financial institutions in other Midwestern states. We will attempt to identify
institutions that we believe will fit well with our current franchise objectives
and corporate culture.

We have no current arrangements or agreements to acquire other banks, thrifts
and financial service companies or branch offices. However, we have had, and
intend to continue to have, discussions with local financial institutions to
determine whether they would be interested in exploring the possibility of our
acquiring them after the offering is completed and we have sufficient capital
resources to fund an acquisition. In addition, we have participated in, and
intend to continue to participate in, sales processes initiated on behalf of
local financial institutions that have made a decision to explore the
possibility of a sale. We also have explored, and intend to continue to explore,
the possibility of acquiring financial service companies, including leasing
companies and insurance agencies, and engaging in limited de novo branching. We
are presently investigating the feasibility of establishing a small number of de
novo branches in the Chicago metropolitan area, but have no current plans to
engage in extensive de novo branching. In addition, we have no current
arrangements or agreements, and we have filed no regulatory
applications, to establish de novo branches. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to consummate any acquisition or establish any new branches.  

Initially, the net proceeds will be invested in short-term investments,
investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities."

(1) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares which could
    occur due to a 15% increase in the offering range to reflect demand for the  
    shares, changes in market or general financial conditions following the      
    commencement of the offering, or regulatory considerations.                  


Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but
will result in a reduction of BankFinancial, F.S.B.’s deposits. The net proceeds
may vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be more or less
than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a syndicated
community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not purchased in the
subscription and community offerings.

 
BankFinancial Corporation May Use the Proceeds it Retains From the Offering:

    •    to repay $30.0 million in term debt, discussed above, that we incurred as 
         part of our acquisition of Success Bancshares and our redemption of trust 
         preferred securities assumed in that acquisition;                         

    •    to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares of 
         common stock in the offering (between $12.6 million and $17.0 million, or 
         $19.6 million if the offering is increased by 15%);                       

    •    to invest in debt securities issued by the United States government and   
         United States government-sponsored agencies or entities;                  

    •    to finance the acquisition of financial institutions or other financial   
         service companies;                                                        

  •   to pay cash dividends to stockholders;

  •   to repurchase shares of our common stock; and

  •   for other general corporate purposes.

Initially, we intend to invest a substantial portion of the net proceeds in
short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed
securities.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the conversion,
except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory
approval.
 

BankFinancial, F.S.B. May Use the Net Proceeds it Receives From the Offering:

    •    to expand its retail and commercial banking franchise by acquiring other  
         financial institutions or other financial services companies, or by       
         acquiring or establishing new branches;                                   

    •    to fund new loans, including multi-family mortgage and nonresidential real
         estate and land loans, construction loans, commercial loans and leases and
         single-family residential mortgage loans;                                 

    •    to enhance existing products and services and to support new products and 
         services;                                                                 

    •    to establish off-site ATMs;

    •    to invest in debt securities issued by the United States government and   
         United States government-sponsored agencies or entities; and              

    •   for other general corporate purposes.

Our short-term and long-term growth plans anticipate that, upon completion of
the offering, we will experience measured growth through increased lending and
investment activities, limited de novo branching and, possibly, acquisitions,
with a particular emphasis on attempting to stimulate internal loan growth
through the hiring of additional individuals experienced in the origination of
commercial, commercial real estate and multifamily loans using targeted
marketing efforts. We plan to explore acquisition opportunities involving other
banks and thrifts, and possibly financial service companies, when and as they
arise as a means of supplementing internal growth, filling gaps in our current
geographic footprint and expanding our customer base, product lines and internal
capabilities. We may also consider establishing de novo branches or acquiring
financial institutions in other Midwestern states. We will attempt to identify
institutions that we believe will fit well with our current franchise objectives
and corporate culture.

We have no current arrangements or agreements to acquire other banks, thrifts
and financial service companies or branch offices. However, we have had, and
intend to continue to have, discussions with local financial institutions to
determine whether they would be interested in exploring the possibility of our
acquiring them after the offering is completed and we have sufficient capital
resources to fund an acquisition. In addition, we have participated in, and
intend to continue to participate in, sales processes initiated on behalf of
local financial institutions that have made a decision to explore the
possibility of a sale. We also have explored, and intend to continue to explore,
the possibility of acquiring financial service companies, including leasing
companies and insurance agencies, and engaging in limited de novo branching. We
are presently investigating the feasibility of establishing a small number of de
novo branches in the Chicago metropolitan area, but have no current plans to
engage in extensive de novo branching. In addition, we have no current
arrangements or agreements, and we have filed no regulatory
applications, to establish de novo branches. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to consummate any acquisition or establish any new branches.  

Initially, the net proceeds will be invested in short-term investments,
investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities."

shares that we are selling in this offering will be $62.4 million.

We currently anticipate that we will use $12.0 million of the net proceeds to us
to prepay the entire principal and interest currently outstanding under our
revolving credit facility. The principal of the revolving credit facility is due
on May 31, 2006 and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%, payable every
three months. We are negotiating the terms of a new credit facility that we
currently anticipate will be available in July 2005. Until then, on a temporary
basis, we borrowed $12.0 million under our revolving credit facility on June 17,
2005 to fund our working capital. In addition, we will take possession of one
additional vessel on June 28, 2005 for which we paid $15.8 million, and we
anticipate executing a memorandum of agreement on June 30, 2005 to purchase an
additional vessel at a cost of $13.8 million.

We currently anticipate that we will use the balance of the net proceeds to us
to purchase additional dry bulk carriers and multipurpose tweendeckers, to the
extent available. We are actively looking for dry bulk carriers and multipurpose
tweendeckers and evaluating potential acquisitions of additional vessels.
Because other shipping companies might be willing to pay more than we are for
the vessels that we currently are evaluating, we cannot assure you that we will
be able to acquire additional vessels with the net proceeds of the offering.
Current market prices for these vessels would permit us to acquire up to five
vessels with the net proceeds.

If suitable vessels do not become available for purchase at acceptable prices,
we expect to use a portion of the net proceeds to repay debt and for working
capital. In particular, certain events may arise which could result in our not
taking delivery of a vessel, such as a total loss of a vessel, a constructive
total loss of a vessel or substantial damage to a vessel prior to its delivery.
See ""Risk Factors There are risks associated with the purchase and operation of
secondhand vessels"" for more information on the risks associated with growing
our business through the purchase of secondhand vessels.

Because we do not know at this time the amount of the net proceeds that we might
allocate to repaying indebtedness, other than repayment of the $12.0 million
currently outstanding under our revolving credit facility, we are unable to
specify the full amount of debt that we might repay. To the extent that we use
additional proceeds to repay debt, we would expect to reduce the amount
outstanding under our $22.5 million credit facility, which bears interest at
LIBOR plus 3.7%. We entered into this credit facility in July 2004, and have
used the funds to purchase vessels for our controlled fleet. This facility is
collateralized by ship mortgage notes on three of our vessels.

We will use the net proceeds from the sale of 85,520 Class A common shares by
Roymar and TBS Shipping Services, estimated at approximately $0.8 million, to
pay the federal, state and local employment taxes and income withholding taxes
associated with the issuance of 106,900 Class A common shares to certain
employees of Roymar and TBS Shipping Services. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of Class A common shares
by the other selling shareholders."

offered by us will be approximately $53.4 million after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares to be sold
by the selling stockholders.

    The primary purposes of the offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, obtain additional capital and repay outstanding indebtedness under
our new credit agreement, which we entered into with a syndicate of banks on
February 15, 2005 with a five year term. We intend to use $31 million of the net
proceeds of this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our new credit
agreement. We expect to use the balance of the net proceeds from this offering,
including any net proceeds we receive if the underwriters elect to exercise
their overallotment option, for working capital and general corporate purposes,
which may include the expansion of existing facilities, strategic acquisitions
and the development and introduction of new programs. Any amounts repaid under
our new credit agreement may be reborrowed at any time. As of April 30, 2005, we
had outstanding borrowings of $31.0 million and $4.1 million in letters of
credit under our new credit agreement. We paid interest on the amounts
outstanding under our new credit agreement at an adjusted LIBOR rate, as defined
in the new credit agreement, of 4.07% as of April 30, 2005. Amounts under the
new credit agreement were primarily borrowed for working capital and general
corporate purposes, as well as to repay amounts outstanding under our previous
credit agreement, primarily borrowed in connection with our acquisition of
Southwestern College, and New England Technical Institute. See ""Description of
Credit Agreement."" We routinely consider acquiring companies in our industry. At
any given time, we may be in discussions to acquire one or more companies.
Depending upon the timing of any future acquisition, we may use the net proceeds
of this offering toward the purchase price of such acquisitions. We currently
have an executed non-binding letter of intent with respect to the acquisition of
an education company. The letter of intent is subject to conditions precedent
prior to the consummation of the acquisition, including the completion of due
diligence and the negotiation and execution of a definitive purchase agreement.
We cannot assure you that the acquisition will ultimately be consummated.
Management will have broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of
this offering.

    The amounts actually expended for each purpose and the timing of such
expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including our realization of
the different elements of our growth strategy and the amount of cash generated
by our operations. Pending their use as described above, the proceeds of the
offering will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing securities.

    An affiliate of Harris Nesbitt Corp. is the administrative agent and a
lender under our new credit agreement and Fleet National Bank, an affiliate of
Banc of America Securities LLC, is also a lender under our new credit agreement,
and will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering when we repay
the amounts outstanding under the new credit agreement."

    We intend to use $183.5 million of the net proceeds to repay $124.2 million
of indebtedness outstanding under our existing credit facility and $59.3 million
of indebtedness owed to Eagle Ventures under a promissory note, including
accrued interest. Our existing credit facility had an outstanding principal
balance of $186.0 million as of June 2, 2005, bears interest at a rate of 0.95%
plus LIBOR and matures in April 2015. The Eagle Ventures promissory note that we
expect to repay had an outstanding principal amount of approximately
$58.7 million as of June 2, 2005, bears interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and
matures in June 2011. This note was issued in connection with the extension of
debt financing provided to us by Eagle Ventures used for vessel acquisitions and
general corporate purposes. 

    In addition, we intend to use $2.2 million of the net proceeds of this
offering to pay a $1.2 million fee under our new credit facility and to pay a
$1 million one-time fee to Kelso to terminate certain of our obligations under a
financial advisory agreement with Kelso.

approximately $110.0 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and our estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use the proceeds of this offering:

•  to repay up to $110.0 million of indebtedness under our new $350.0 million   
   senior secured credit facility;                                              
  
•  to pay the fees and expenses of this offering; and                           
  
•  for working capital and general corporate purposes.                          

With respect to the $110.0 million indebtedness to be repaid under our new
senior secured credit facility with the net proceeds of this offering, we intend
to repay outstanding borrowings, if any, under the revolving credit facility and
the remainder will be used to repay a portion of the $225.0 million term loan.
We incurred such indebtedness in February 2005, when we entered into the new
senior secured credit facility. The proceeds of the new senior secured credit
facility, together with the proceeds of our $275.0 million floating rate notes,
were used to refinance our then-existing indebtedness; pay a $201.2 million
dividend to our stockholders; make a $36.4 million cash payment to holders of
our stock options (including applicable payroll taxes of $0.6 million); pay the
fees and expenses associated with the new senior secured credit facility and the
floating rate notes, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.

As of May 31, 2005, the term loan, which matures on August 11, 2011, bore
interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum and the revolving credit facility, which
matures on February 11, 2010, bore interest at either LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum
or a base rate plus 1.50% per annum. As of May 31, 2005, there were no
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

offering are estimated to be $46,360,000 ($53,614,000 if the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full), after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us
estimated at $2,000,000.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds as follows:

    •   $1.9 million to repay the promissory notes given to the previous owners of 
        Specialty Pharmacies;                                                      

    •   $1.6 million to repurchase 175,719 of the warrants we issued to the        
        previous owners of Specialty Pharmacies;                                   

    •   $1.0 million to Oris Medical pursuant to the terms of the definitive       
        agreement with Oris Medical;                                               

    •   approximately $2.9 million to repay the amount outstanding under our GE    
        credit facility, based on the amount outstanding as of June 15, 2005;      

    •   approximately $1.5 million to repay the amount outstanding under our loan  
        with West Bank;                                                            

    •   approximately $2.0 million to repay the amount outstanding under our       
        subordinated note issued to Crestview Capital Master, LLC; and             

    •   the remaining amount for working capital and other general corporate       
        purposes.                                                                  

Our notes issued to the previous owners of Specialty Pharmacies accrue interest
at the prime rate plus 2% and are due on February 28, 2006. We used these notes
as part of the consideration to acquire Specialty Pharmacies.

Our revolving credit facility with GE Capital expires in April 2006 and interest
accrues under the facility based upon the prime rate of interest in existence at
the time of each borrowing under the facility plus 2%. Because this facility is
used to fund working capital it typically fluctuates between $1.5 and $4.5
million outstanding. Our line of credit with West Bank matures in September 2005
and accrues interest at the prime rate plus 2% of interest per annum. The prime
rate at March 31, 2005 was equal to 5.75%.

Our subordinated note issued to Crestview Capital Master, LLC accrues interest
at a rate of 10% per year. This subordinated note matures on the earlier of
three days following closing of this offering or May 13, 2006. Fees of $160,000
were incurred due to the issuance of the subordinated notes.

The amounts actually expended for the purposes listed above may vary
significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of
our future net sales, expenses and other factors described under “Risk Factors”
beginning on page 8. While we have no current plans, agreements or commitments
with respect to any acquisition other than the pending acquisition of
substantially all of the assets of Oris Medical that is described elsewhere in
this prospectus, we may, if the opportunity arises, use an unspecified portion
of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in products, technologies or companies.
Our management may spend the proceeds from this offering in ways that our
stockholders may not deem desirable.

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above intended purposes,
we intend to invest the funds in short-term, investment grade securities. We
cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will return a favorable yield."

interest expense, under our new term loan with the remaining $0.4 million to
repay a portion of the outstanding promissory notes held by certain of our
owners, some of whom are directors and officers of our general partner. 

On April 28, 2005, we incurred $69.0 million of indebtedness under the new term
loan. This term loan bears interest at our option at a floating rate equal to
either the prime rate plus 1.50% or LIBOR (preadjusted for reserves) plus 2.50%
and matures on the earlier of the closing date of this offering or December 31,
2005. We used $18.6 million of the net proceeds from the term loan to partially
repay indebtedness under our credit facility and the remainder to make
distributions to owners of our general partner, some of whom are current
directors and officers of our general partner. Substantially all of our
indebtedness under our credit facility was incurred to make distributions to
owners of our general partner. 

The lender under our new term loan is Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., an affiliate
of Lehman Brothers Inc., one of the underwriters in this offering. As a result,
Lehman Brothers may have a conflict of interest with respect to this offering
because it has interests in the successful completion of this offering beyond
the underwriting discount and commissions it will receive. For this reason, A.G.
Edwards & Sons, Inc. has agreed to act as a “qualified independent underwriter”
as such role is defined by Rule 2720 of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc.’s Conduct Rules. 

We anticipate that we will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional units to repay outstanding
promissory notes held by certain of our owners."

     The short-term loans from the representative includes a 10% loan of $20,000
made in July 2004 and an additional $200,000 loan in May 2005, which is
interest-free. We used the proceeds from these loans for working capital and
general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $30,000 of advances made
by certain of our executive officers to fund manufacturing costs.

     Our general corporate and working capital needs include general and
administrative salaries, accounting, legal and consulting fees, payment of
accounts payable, rent and other facilities expenses and other working capital
needs. No payments will be made to insiders on outstanding loans, advances or
past due salaries out of proceeds allocated to working capital, except $25,000
to repay accrued salary owed to our chief financial officer.

     The foregoing discussion is merely an estimate based on our current
business plan. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the net
proceeds we receive from this offering for other purposes, and we will have
broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities."

purposes, including costs associated with our entry into the Japanese market,
expansion of our sales force, research and development activities, facilities
expansion and other working capital and capital expenditures. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including
the growth of our sales and marketing activities, status of our research and

the amount of cash generated by our operations, if any. We may also use a
portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, companies,

net proceeds will be approximately $175.3 million.

   º This column is in U.S. dollars as a convenience for you, based on the
     May 10, 2005 exchange rate of 1.00 per $1.29.

    In estimating how we will use the net proceeds from this offering, we have
assumed that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option. If
the over-allotment option is exercised, we will use the additional net proceeds
for research and development of our other product candidates and for additional
working capital.

    Our Series A senior convertible promissory notes bear interest at a per
annum rate of seven percent (7%) through March 31, 2005, ten percent (10%) per
annum from April 1, 2005 until the maturity date and the one-month LIBOR rate
plus twelve percent (12%) after maturity. The notes, if not earlier converted
into our ordinary shares, are due and payable 30 days following the completion
of this offering. The net proceeds of the notes were used to repay certain
indebtedness related to capital improvements of our manufacturing facilities
(including indebtedness to Sirton), to pay for research and development of
defibrotide to treat and prevent VOD and for working capital. One holder of
these notes who has elected to have its note repaid with the proceeds of this
offering is also a shareholder of our company.

    As of December 31, 2004, we had inter-company outstanding debt in the amount
of 2.2 million (approximately $2.838 million) to Sirton, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FinSirton. Sirton lent us 1.0 million (approximately
$1.29 million) in each of March 2004 and May 2004, 400 thousand (approximately
$516 thousand) in June 2004 and 600 thousand (approximately $774 thousand) in
July 2004. All loans were borrowed at 3.5% interest per annum and each matures
on October 1, 2008. We repaid 800 thousand (approximately $1.032 million) of the
loans in 2004 and 700 thousand (approximately $903 thousand) in January 2005
with the net proceeds from the sale of our Series A senior convertible
promissory notes, leaving 1.5 million (approximately $1.935 million) outstanding
on the date of this prospectus. We plan to repay this remaining 1.5 million from
the net proceeds of this offering.

    The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the status of our research and development efforts, licensing
and collaboration activities and amount of cash generated or used by our 
operations. We have not determined the exact amount or timing of expenditures 
in the areas listed above and will retain broad discretion in the allocation 
and use of the net proceeds.

    Pending their use, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in
short-term investment grade, interest bearing, debt instruments or bank
deposits. It is possible that we may become a passive foreign investment company
for United States federal tax purposes, which could result in negative tax
consequences for you."

$68.5 million, based upon the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share
and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses not paid by March 31, 2005. The principal purposes of this
offering are to obtain additional capital, create a public market for our common
stock, enhance our public profile, strengthen our ability to acquire other
companies’ products and technologies and facilitate further access to public
securities markets. To the extent that the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option to purchase up to 937,500 shares from the selling
stockholders, we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by
the selling stockholders, although we will bear the costs, other than
underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with those sales.

We expect to use approximately $24.7 million of the net proceeds received by us
in this offering to redeem all outstanding shares of our preferred stock under
the terms of our certificate of incorporation, including approximately
$21.5 million that will be distributed to entities affiliated with Parthenon
Capital and $526,000 and $242,000 that will be distributed to our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively. In addition, we
will use approximately $1.5 million of the net proceeds to repay one half of the
principal amount of promissory notes issued primarily to our founders in
connection with the repurchase of a warrant agreement that becomes payable upon
the closing of this offering. The notes bear interest at 2.48% per annum,
compounded and paid annually. The second half of the outstanding principal plus
all of the accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable in full upon the
earlier to occur of (1) the first secondary offering of our common stock or (2)
18 months following the effective date of this offering. We expect to use the
remaining net proceeds of approximately $42.3 million for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including product development and expanding
our manufacturing, engineering, operations, marketing and sales departments. We
plan to add additional direct sales executives in other regions across the
United States, including the Northeast, Midwest and Northwest. In addition, we
plan to use net proceeds from this offering to build out our international sales
and marketing presence in Europe and in Asia. However, we have not determined
the amounts that we will expend in each of these areas. We may also use a
portion of the proceeds to pay down our short-term line of credit with Silicon
Valley Bank. As of March 31, 2005, the amount outstanding was approximately
$19.5 million, and accrues interest at the bank’s prime rate plus 1% per annum
and matures on August 31, 2005. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for
the future acquisition of, or investment in, companies, assets or technologies
that complement our business, although we are not pursuing any acquisitions or
investments as of the date of this prospectus. We have not allocated specific
amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
remaining after the redemption of our preferred stock and the repayment of the
promissory notes issued primarily to our founders, and investors will be relying
on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds of
this offering. Pending these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing obligations, investment grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United
States. The goal with respect to the investment of these net proceeds is capital
preservation and liquidity so that such funds are readily available to fund our
operations."

not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

      We intend to use approximately $16.4 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay the following indebtedness: (1) $14.7 million outstanding as
of March 31, 2005 under our credit facility, bearing interest at prime plus 1.5%
and due April 15, 2010, with Residential Funding Corporation; (2) $730,000 of

due July 1, 2006, with The Catalyst Fund, Ltd. and Southwest/Catalyst Capital,
Ltd.; and (3) approximately $935,000 of outstanding indebtedness assumed by us
in connection with acquisitions completed by us in 2004. Following this offering
and the application of the net proceeds, we do not expect to have any
indebtedness outstanding under our senior secured credit facility. During 2004
we borrowed funds under our credit facility with Residential Funding Corporation
for acquisitions and general working capital purposes.

      We also intend to use approximately $2.2 million of the net proceeds to
satisfy our cash obligations to one of our joint venture partners with respect
to its right to convert its equity interests in the joint venture into shares of
our common stock and cash upon the consummation of this offering.

      The remaining proceeds of approximately $24.2 million will be used for
general corporate purposes, including working capital, payment of other
indebtedness, sales and marketing and capital expenditures. We may also use a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering to pursue strategic acquisitions
of additional home nursing agencies or larger home nursing operations that would
allow us to acquire market share in new and existing markets. We currently have
no agreements or commitments for any such acquisitions or joint venture
investments. We do have a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of
home nursing agencies in West Virginia, at a proposed purchase price of
approximately $4.5 million. This acquisition is subject to our completion of due
diligence, the negotiation of definitive agreements and the receipt of all
required regulatory consents. The amounts that we actually expend for these
specified purposes may vary significantly depending on a number of factors,
including changes in our growth strategy, the amount of our future net service
revenue and expenses, and our future cash flow. As a result, we will retain
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering and may
spend such proceeds for any purpose, including purposes not presently
contemplated.

      Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above purposes, we
intend to invest the funds in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing
securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a
favorable return."
