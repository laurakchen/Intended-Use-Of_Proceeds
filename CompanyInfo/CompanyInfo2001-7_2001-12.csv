HPL TECHNOLOGIES INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/hpl-technologies-inc-86804-13679,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/hpl-technologies-inc-86804-13679,424B4,7/31/2001,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1600750,"We expect the net proceeds from our sale of 6,000,000 shares of common stock to 
be approximately $59.8 million, at the initial public offering price of $11.00 
per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and 
estimated offering expenses of $1.5 million payable by us. If the underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds 
will be approximately $69 million. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to establish a public market for 
our common stock, increase our visibility in the marketplace, facilitate our 
future access to public capital markets, provide liquidity to existing 
stockholders and obtain additional working capital. 

Our management will have broad discretion as to the use of the proceeds from 
this offering. We expect to use the proceeds from this offering for research 
and development, sales and marketing activities, including international 
expansion in Japan, Europe, Taiwan and Singapore, and other general corporate 
purposes. We currently anticipate that our expenditures for research and 
development and for sales and marketing will be approximately $8 million and $9 
million, respectively, in the year ending March 31, 2002, and that 
approximately one-half of the sales and marketing expenditures for fiscal 2002 
will be used for international expansion, including approximately $2 million 
related to opening an office in Japan. The amounts we spend for these purposes 
are subject to our regular evaluation, and our actual expenditures could vary 
significantly from these estimates. A portion of net proceeds may also be used 
to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or products. 
However, we have no current agreements, arrangements or understandings with 
respect to any acquisitions or investments, and we are not currently engaged 
in negotiations with respect to any acquisitions or investments. 

In addition, under the terms of a secured convertible debenture in the 
principal amount of $1.5 million issued to Applied Materials in February 2000, 
Applied Materials currently has the right to demand repayment of the debenture. 
As a result, we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay 
this debenture. The debenture is due on February 15, 2005, bears interest at 8% 
per year and is convertible into shares of common stock at $1.45 per share. 

We may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to pay tax-withholding 
obligations we may incur if one of our option holders, Philip Gruebele, 
exercises his non-qualified stock option. We anticipate that Mr. Gruebele will 
exercise his option to purchase up to 1,632,000 shares at an exercise price of 
$0.015 per share prior to its expiration in September 2001, and that, promptly 
after the date of exercise, we will be obligated to remit withholding taxes in 
the amount of approximately 36% of the difference between the then current 
aggregate value of the shares obtained on exercise and the aggregate exercise 
price. If Mr. Gruebele does not deliver sufficient funds to pay the withholding 
taxes then due, we must pay the taxes. If we advance any funds to pay 
withholding taxes for Mr. Gruebele, we will withhold a number of shares 
otherwise deliverable to Mr. Gruebele equal in value to the taxes paid. 

Pending such uses of the net proceeds, we intend to invest them in investment 
grade, interest-bearing securities."

The
following represents our best estimate as to how the proceeds will be expended.
New Medium Enterprises, Inc. reserves the right to redirect any portion of the
funds either amongst the items referred to below or to such other projects of
New Medium Enterprises, Inc. as management considers being in the best interest
of New Medium Enterprises, Inc.

     We are actively pursuing acquisition possibilities in the wireless hardware
sector, which we believe will complement our activities in association with
Broadeo's Internet services. Concurrently we are also actively pursuing
acquisition targets in other industries. Consequently, we are budgeting our
expenses for the next twelve months to allow for cash down payment for an
acquisition and related costs with the hope that we can structure an equity
transaction with a prospective acquisition target.

During the next twelve months, we expect to spend an estimated total of 
$ $300,000 as follows: 

(i) $130,000 for general & administration expenses. Effective in March 2001, 
two of our employees, Eva Beilus and Sam Beilus have agreed to accrue their 
salaries for a period of six months in the amounts of $26,000 and $14,000, 
respectively. New Medium Enterprises, Inc. may reinstate cash salaries at some 
future point in time. 

(ii) $150,000 for research and development of a prototype for the phase 1 
Broadeo video-on-demand hosting service and for business development efforts in 
establishing strategic alliances with suppliers of the key technologies of the 
Broadeo Wireless Local Loop hardware. Stratagram Technology Group Inc., the 
company from which we purchased the Broadeo assets, will lead and oversee all 
of the Broadeo projects with full time on premises technology and business 
consulting services at a fee of $104,000 per year, which is included in the 
$150,000 above. 

(iii) $20,000 for Intellitain Media - Intellitain has hired actors and a 
production firm and has produced a sample preview of its first production, a 
political talk/game show for television in which contestants were questioned on 
their views on political issues of today and debated those views with other 
contestants. The cost of the initial production was approximately $10,000. 
During the next six months, Intellitain plans to edit and cut the video copy 
and to present demos to syndications and broadcasters at an estimated cost of 
an additional five thousand dollars. Intellitain may allocate an additional 
$15,000 to produce an educational game show for children's television channels. 


We are also budgeting in our expenses for the next twelve months to allow for 
$300,000 cash down payment for an acquisition and related costs. 

We are not budgeting any cash for the completion of CodeTrek since 333 Media 
Inc., the company to which we outsourced the development of the software agreed 
to accrue payment for six months in an amount of approximately $200,000. 
Furthermore, we will be seeking to obtain a licensing agreement with a software 
marketing company under a shared royalty arrangement New Medium Enterprises, 
Inc. will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the 
Selling Shareholders. However, we may receive up to $12,361,250 only if the 
Warrants are exercised at an average exercise price of $1.00 per Warrant. There 
is no assurance that the Warrants will be exercised and that any proceeds may 
be received from these Warrants. 

Should we succeed in raising funds through the exercise of Warrants, we plan to 
utilize a substantial portion of the funds raised for acquisitions, and our 
activities in the broadband Internet communications sector. 

We believe we have sufficient funds available to operate for next twelve 
months, even without raising additional funds."

of our common stock pursuant to this offering and the sale of the 500,000 
shares of our common stock in the concurrent private placement will be $55.1 
million, or $62.6 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, at the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses. 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the offering, in approximate 
percentage terms, as follows: 

- 20-35% for further development of our products, technologies and 
methodologies; 

- 15-30% to increase Design-to-Silicon Yield Solutions capacity; 

- 10-25% for the expansion of our marketing and sales organizations; and 

- 10-55% for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

These operating expenses will be partially offset by the degree to which we 
continue to garner revenues from our ongoing activities. 

The amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary significantly depending 
upon a number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, competitive 
and technological developments and the amount of cash we generate from 
operations. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to 
acquire additional businesses, products and technologies, to acquire additional 
office space, or to establish joint ventures that we believe will complement 
our current or future business. As a result, we will retain broad discretion 
in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses 
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities. We cannot predict 
whether the proceeds will be invested to yield a favorable return. We believe 
our available cash, together with the net proceeds of this offering, will be 
sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next 12 months."

the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that 
the net proceeds from this offering will be $127.8 million. We estimate that 
the total net proceeds of the offering will be used to repay indebtedness under 
our credit facility currently bearing interest ranging from 6.625% to 7.0625% 
per annum with maturity dates ranging from 2006 to 2008."

underwriters' over-allotment is exercised in full) in net proceeds from the 
sale of our common stock in this offering, after deducting the underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, including the 
estimated expenses of officers and directors insurance, payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds: 

- to pay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, the 
balance of which was $24.7 million at March 31, 2001, 

- to purchase for $25.4 million ownership interests of some of our partners in 
five of our heart hospitals in the exchange, 

- to develop additional heart hospitals, and 

- for working capital and other corporate purposes, including the possible 
acquisition of additional interests in our heart hospitals. 

The foregoing represents our current expectations regarding the use of 
proceeds. The actual amount and timing of some of these expenditures will 
depend on future events and cannot be predicted with certainty. We will have 
broad discretion when allocating a significant portion of the proceeds. Pending 
their application to the intended uses, we will invest the net proceeds in 
short-term investment-grade debt securities. 

We anticipate we will need to reborrow significant amounts under our corporate 
revolving credit facility in the future. The facility provides for $100.0 
million in availability, $10.0 million of which is designated for short-term 
borrowings. Affiliates of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc. and Banc of America 
Securities LLC, two of the underwriters of this offering, are lenders under our 
corporate revolving credit facility and collectively will receive 37.5% of any 
outstanding amounts we pay under that credit facility. See ""Underwriting."""

discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will receive net 
proceeds of approximately $56.9 million. The principal purposes of this 
offering are to create a public market for common stock and to attract and 
retain qualified employees by providing them with equity incentives. We 
currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

. approximately $3.0 million to fund international expansion; 

. approximately $2.0 million to expand our research and development, 
manufacturing and customer service activities; 

. approximately $4.0 million in 2001 on the market launch of our CO-Stat 
products and future new products; 

. approximately $1.1 million in 2001 on fixed assets; 

. approximately $1.5 million to repay the outstanding amounts of our revolving 
bank line of credit upon the closing of this offering; and 

. for working capital. 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the 
acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies. While we 
evaluate these types of opportunities from time to time, there are currently no 
agreements or negotiations with respect to any specific transaction. 

We have not yet determined all of our expected expenditures, and we cannot 
estimate the amounts to be used for each purpose set forth above with any 
degree of certainty. Actual expenditures may vary significantly from our 
estimates. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in 
applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds as

underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of common stock by Warburg Pincus if the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option. 

We anticipate using the net proceeds of the offering to: 

- Repay an aggregate of approximately $38.1 million of our outstanding 
subordinated notes. As of March 31, 2001, we had approximately $45.6 million 
aggregate principal amount of our subordinated notes outstanding, plus accrued 
interest of approximately $5.6 million, of which approximately $41.2 million 
aggregate principal amount was issued in connection with our recapitalization 
and our acquisition of Cremascoli. Additionally, we anticipate using additional 
net offering proceeds to repay interest that will accrue on the outstanding 
subordinated notes from April 1, 2001 through the date of the closing of the 
offering. Accrued interest on the subordinated notes for the three months ended 
June 30, 2001 is anticipated to approximate $1.1 million. The subordinated 
notes bear interest at 10% per year. Amounts outstanding under our subordinated 
notes are due in December 2006. See ""Certain Transactions"" for more information 
on our subordinated notes. Substantially all of our outstanding subordinated 
notes are held by our officers, directors, employees and principal stockholders. 

- Repay an aggregate of approximately $31.7 million of outstanding indebtedness 
(1) which includes approximately $16.9 million of our $65.0 million 
dollar-denominated senior credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by 
JPMorgan, a division of Chase Securities Inc., and (2) the outstanding balance 
of approximately $14.8 million of our E22.5 million euro-denominated senior 
credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan, a division of Chase 
Securities Inc., and Bank of America. We entered into our senior credit 
facilities in connection with our recapitalization and our acquisition of 
Cremascoli. See ""Certain Transactions,"" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital 
Resources"" and ""Underwriting"" for more information on our senior credit 
facilities. Upon making these debt payments, we will have approximately 
$40.1 million of outstanding indebtedness remaining related to our 
dollar-denominated senior credit facility. Borrowings under our dollar-denominated 
senior credit facility bear interest at either a prime rate-based rate or 
eurodollar-based rate. As of the date of this prospectus, we have only 
requested eurodollar rate-based loans from our lenders. As of March 31, 2001, 
this interest rate was 8.16%. Borrowings under our euro-denominated senior 
credit facility bear interest at an euro-dollar based rate. As of March 31, 
2001, this interest rate was 5.091%. Amounts outstanding under our 
dollar-denominated senior credit facility come due in December 2005 and amounts 
outstanding under our euro-denominated senior credit facility come due in 
November 2005. 

We plan to use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes, 
including to fund working capital, expansion of our current product offerings 
through research and development and acquisitions of technologies, products and 
companies. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements with 
respect to any acquisitions. We anticipate our spending on research and 
development to remain consistent as a percentage of net sales with our past 
levels of spending.

12,000,000 common shares in this offering after deducting the underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us will be 
approximately $176.5 million ($203.4 million if the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full). We will contribute substantially all of the net 
proceeds to Max Re to increase its capital and surplus so as to permit it to 
increase its underwriting capacity."
MYKROLIS CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/mykrolis-corp-84789-12553,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/mykrolis-corp-84789-12553,424B4,8/10/2001,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1609928,"We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be approximately 
$94.5 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for: 

. repayment of an aggregate of approximately $19.5 million, or approximately 
$34.1 million if the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option, 
outstanding under our separation revolving credit agreement and our separation 
note with Millipore. Amounts outstanding under the separation revolving credit 
agreement must be repaid on or before the earlier of December 31, 2002 or 
fifteen days following the closing of this offering and bear no interest. Any 
amounts remaining outstanding thereafter are in default and bear interest at a 
rate of twelve-month LIBOR plus 1.5% per annum. As of June 30, 2001 we had 
approximately $13.8 million outstanding under the separation revolving credit 
agreement. Amounts borrowed under the separation revolving credit agreement 
were used to fund our working capital requirements between the date of our 
separation and this offering and to satisfy any amounts payable by us related 
to the retention by Millipore of specified Mykrolis assets and liabilities and 
the retention by us of specified Millipore assets and liabilities that could not 
be transferred at the separation due to restrictions imposed by foreign laws or 
because such transfer was not practical. The separation note is payable no later 
than the fifteenth day following this offering and any amounts repaid on or 
prior to such date will bear no interest. If we are in default on the payment 
of the separation note, interest will accrue at an interest rate equal to a 
base rate plus 1.5% per annum. At March 31, 2001, the interest rate would have 
been 9.5% per annum. Millipore contributed its microelectronics business to us 
in exchange for shares of our common stock plus the separation note. The amount 
of the separation note represents amounts payable to Millipore pursuant to the 
terms of our separation agreements and was determined by agreement between 
Millipore and us to ensure that all net proceeds of this offering in excess of 
$75.0 million would be payable to Millipore. The principal balance of the 
separation note is calculated by deducting from the net proceeds of this 
offering (i) the outstanding balance under the separation revolving credit 
agreement as described above, and (ii) the $75.0 million to be retained by us 
for general corporate purposes from the proceeds of this offering. As a result, 
the allocation of the approximately $19.5 million, or approximately $34.1 
million if the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option, between 
the separation revolving credit agreement and the separation note will not be 
determined until the time of the offering based upon the amounts borrowed under 
the separation revolving credit agreement; and 

. $75.0 million for general corporate purposes, such as capital expenditures 
associated with the development of our stand-alone infrastructure, research and 
development activities, working capital requirements and other liabilities, and 
potential investments in, or acquisitions of, other businesses or technologies 
that would enable us to address gaps in our product offerings, secure new 
customers, diversify into complementary product markets and broaden our 
technological capabilities. We have not made specific allocations of the net 
proceeds for any of these subcategories and will only make such allocations 
from time to time following this offering as determined in the discretion of 
our management. However, we currently expect to use approximately $8 million to 
renovate laboratory and office space at our headquarters facility in Bedford, 
Massachusetts and approximately $14 million in connection with the opening of a 
new manufacturing facility outside the United States. While we have no current 
commitments with respect to any future acquisitions, we frequently evaluate 
strategic opportunities and, subject to restrictions due to Section 355(e) and 
Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, which may significantly limit our 
ability to issue shares of our common stock for acquisitions, we intend to 
actively pursue acquisitions and investments in complementary businesses. 

Management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of a significant 
portion of the net proceeds of this offering. You will not have the opportunity 
to evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we base our 
decisions on how to use this portion of the proceeds. Pending such uses, we 
intend to invest this portion of the net proceeds of this offering to be 
received by us in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

common stock we are offering, based on an initial public offering price of 
$7.00 per share, will be approximately $37,460,000, or $43,319,000 if the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, after deducting 
the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

Although we have not yet formulated a specific plan, we currently intend to use 
a significant portion of the net proceeds for the expansion of sales, marketing, 
research and development and customer support activities. We also intend to use 
approximately $7.9 million of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding 
principal and interest related to the note held by Baxter Healthcare incurred 
in connection with our acquisition of the Sure-Med product line in January 
1999. The Baxter Healthcare note accrues interest at a rate of 8.0%. In 
addition, the principal under the note is repayable in eight equal quarterly 
installments beginning in March 2002. We also intend to use approximately 
$10.4 million of the net proceeds to redeem 720,800 shares of redeemable 
convertible preferred stock plus accrued interest thereon held by Sun 
Healthcare at the closing of this offering. 

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital and 
other general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and costs to 
support our leasing activities to U.S. government entities. We currently have 
no commitments or agreements and are not involved in any negotiations for 
acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses. 

The amounts that we actually expend on these matters will vary significantly, 
depending on a number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, and 
the amount of cash we generate from operations. As a result, we will retain 
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. 
Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in interest bearing, investment-grade securities."

net proceeds will be approximately $42.6 million.
 
We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We have
not yet allocated any specific amount of proceeds for these purposes. However,
we presently anticipate that we will spend between $12 million and $14 million
for sales and marketing expenses, between $5 million and $7 million for
research and product development activities and between $4 million and $5
million for general and administrative expenses, during the year ending
December 31, 2002 and approximately $1 million to $3 million on capital
expenditures during that year associated with infrastructure upgrades and
expansion of our business. We may use a portion of the net proceeds of this
offering for the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or
technologies. While we evaluate these types of opportunities from time to time,
there are currently no agreements with respect to any specific transaction.
These allocations are only estimates and we will have broad discretion to
adjust them as necessary to address our operational needs in the future. The
actual amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on a number
of factors, including the amount of cash used or generated by our operations,
competitive and technological developments, and the rate of growth, if any, of
our business. Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing,

sale of 3,600,000 shares of common stock in this offering at the initial public
offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and

million.
 
     We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay in
full outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement with Heller Healthcare
Finance, Inc., including accrued and unpaid interest. Our credit agreement
provides us with a $20.0 million revolving line of credit bearing interest at
fluctuating rates equal to 1.0% above the prime rate of interest designated by
Citibank, with a floor of 10% per annum, and with a maturity date of October 2,
2003. As of September 30, 2001, outstanding borrowings under our credit
agreement were $5.5 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $0.1 million,
and the interest rate was 10%. A portion of the outstanding indebtedness under
our credit agreement was used to finance hospice acquisitions. We also intend to
use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay in full our 12%
senior subordinated notes due March 31, 2005, including accrued and unpaid
interest. As of September 30, 2001, $10.5 million in aggregate principal amount
of the notes was outstanding, with no accrued and unpaid interest outstanding.
$10.4 million in principal amount of the notes outstanding as of September 30,
2001 was payable to Capital Resource Lenders III, L.P., one of our 5%
stockholders. We expect to use the balance of the net proceeds to finance
potential acquisitions of hospices and the development of new hospice locations
and also for general corporate purposes.
 
     Depending on future events, we may determine at a later time to use our net
proceeds for different purposes. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments."

This
reflects the sale of 48,000,000 shares of common stock by us, at an initial
public offering price of $36.00 per share. From these gross proceeds, we
estimate we will pay $1,434.0 million to Anthem Insurance's eligible statutory
members who receive cash in lieu of shares of common stock in connection with
the demutualization. We expect to pay from the gross proceeds $79.5 million for
underwriting discounts and an estimated $32.0 million for other offering and
additional demutualization expenses. We will use the estimated balance of
approximately $182.5 million, plus an estimated additional $247.3 million of
net proceeds if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
for general corporate purposes.
 
   With respect to the concurrent offering of units, gross proceeds to us will
be $200.0 million. We expect to pay from the gross proceeds approximately $9.0
million for underwriting discounts and offering expenses. From the resulting
net proceeds of $191.0 million, together with estimated net proceeds of
$1,616.5 million from this initial public offering of common stock (for
estimated net proceeds from both offerings aggregating $1,807.5 million),
payments totaling an estimated $1,625.0 million will be made to eligible
statutory members of Anthem Insurance who receive cash instead of shares of
Anthem, Inc. common stock in the demutualization. We will use the balance of
the net proceeds from both offerings of approximately $182.5 million, plus an
estimated additional $276.2 million of net proceeds if the underwriters

the net proceeds of this offering to make the following payments:
 
    - approximately $81.7 million to repay a portion of the outstanding balances
      under our credit facility, which becomes due on July 29, 2005. As of
      October 1, 2001, the outstanding balance of principal and interest on our
      credit facility was approximately $146.1 million and the effective
      interest rate was 7.19%. Amounts outstanding under our credit facility
      include amounts borrowed under a revolving loan facility, which we use to
      finance working capital. On March 16, 2001, to finance our acquisition of
      ClinForce, we amended our credit facility to provide for an additional
      term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $30.0 million; and
 
    - approximately $40.3 million to redeem all of our outstanding senior
      subordinated notes and pay a redemption premium. The senior subordinated
      notes accrue interest at a rate of 12.00% per annum, compounded quarterly,
      and become due on January 1, 2006. As of October 1, 2001, the outstanding
      balance of principal and interest on the senior subordinated notes was
      $38.8 million. As of October 1, 2001, the required redemption premium on
      our senior subordinated notes was approximately $1.5 million.

    The plan of conversion requires us to contribute all or a portion of the net
proceeds to Principal Life to fund (1) policy credits and cash payments for
policyholders for whom policy credits or cash are the required form of
compensation; (2) the elections for cash and the elections or deemed elections
for Account Value Policy Credits that are attributable to policyholders entitled
to these forms of compensation; and (3) an amount equal to the fees and expenses
of the demutualization paid by Principal Life. Under the plan of conversion, we
may retain up to $250.0 million of any remaining proceeds from this offering to
be used for working capital, payment of dividends and other general corporate
purposes. We must contribute any remaining proceeds, before any exercise of the
underwriters' over-allotment option, in excess of this $250.0 million limit to
Principal Life.
 
    In connection with the demutualization, Principal Life will require funds
contributed by us to satisfy the following needs. As of the date of this
prospectus:
 
    - $324.7 million is estimated to be necessary to provide compensation to
      policyholders eligible solely for cash or policy credits;
 
    - $1,329.5 million is estimated to be used to make elective cash payments
      and fund Account Value Policy Credits to policyholders receiving these
      forms of compensation in the demutualization; and
 
    - $39.6 million is estimated to be required for the cost of the nonrecurring
      expenses of Principal Life directly related to the demutualization.
 
    In addition to the shares of our common stock distributed in this offering,
for which we will receive cash proceeds, many policyholders entitled to receive
compensation in the demutualization will receive shares of our common stock
distributed in connection with the demutualization, as well as cash, Account
Value Policy Credits or Separate Account Policy Credits, as compensation for
extinguishment of their membership interests in Principal Mutual Holding
Company. None of Principal Financial Group, Inc., Principal Financial Services,
Inc. or Principal Life will receive any proceeds from the issuance of our common
stock to policyholders entitled to receive compensation in the demutualization
for the extinguishment of their membership interests in Principal Mutual Holding
Company or to the separate account to be established for the Separate Account
Policy Credits."

regulatory and market considerations, and the expenses incurred in connection 
with the offering. Although we will not be able to determine the actual net 
proceeds from the sale of the common stock until we complete the offering, we 
estimate the net proceeds to be between $37.6 million and $51.3 million, or

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the reorganization 
may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would 
increase if a syndicated community offering is used to sell shares not purchased 
in the subscription offering and community offering. The net proceeds will also 
vary if the number of shares to be sold in the offering are adjusted to reflect 
a change in the estimated pro forma market value of Charter Financial and 
CharterBank or if our ESOP purchases shares in the open market at an average 
cost that is higher or lower than $10.00 per share. Payments for shares made 
through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result in the 
receipt of new funds for investment by CharterBank but will result in a 
reduction of CharterBank's deposits and interest expense as funds are 
transferred from interest bearing certificates of deposit or other deposit 
accounts. 

Charter Financial may use the proceeds it retains from the offering: 

. to finance possible acquisitions of financial institutions or other 
financially-related businesses, although we have no current plans to do so; 

. to pay dividends to stockholders; 

. to invest in securities; and 

. for general corporate purposes. 

Following the reorganization, we may also implement stock repurchase programs. 
Our ability to repurchase our common stock may be subject to regulatory 
restrictions. 
CharterBank may use the proceeds it receives from the offering: 

. to fund new loans; 

. to establish or acquire new branches in our targeted market areas within the 
I-85 corridor; 

. to diversify products that we offer; 

. to increase delivery systems, including the expanded use of ATMs and the 
introduction of Internet banking; 

. to repay debt; 

. to invest in securities; and

approximately $20 million to establish new and expand our existing sales and

    We will have broad discretion in the way that we use the net proceeds of

the timing of, and our ability to maintain, regulatory approvals in the 
different countries in which we intend to market the Given System.

    We plan to use approximately $2,750,000 of the net proceeds to fund sales 
and marketing initiatives in the U.S. and internationally, with particular 
emphasis on marketing our Omnicarbon 3000 heart valve in the U.S. We plan to 
use approximately $770,000 of the net proceeds to fund engineering and 
regulatory expenses, including improvements to our proprietary pyrolytic carbon 
coating process, evaluation of new product concepts and technologies and costs 
associated with obtaining FDA approval of the materials used in our Omnicarbon 
4000 heart valves. We currently plan to use approximately $700,000 of the net 
proceeds to purchase equipment used in engineering, manufacturing and 
operations. We plan to use $500,000 to repay bridge note indebtedness incurred 
in August 2001, which we used to pay down our bank line of credit from 
Associated Bank Minnesota. This indebtedness is represented by 10% convertible 
subordinated bridge notes which mature in August 2002. We intend to retain the 
remainder of the net proceeds for general working capital purposes. 

    The amounts actually expended for the above purposes may vary significantly 
depending upon a number of factors, such as revenue growth, if any, and the 
actual cost to enter the U.S. market with our Omnicarbon 3000 heart valve. If 
the over-allotment option is exercised, we plan to use the additional net 
proceeds we receive for working capital purposes. Until we use the net proceeds 
of this offering for the purposes described above, we intend to invest such

from the sale of 4,850,000 shares of our common stock. If the underwriters'

are based on an initial public offering price of $13.00 per share less the
underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by
us.
 
  The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our working capital,
create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to
the public capital markets. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering
primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital. We have
not yet determined the expected expenditures and thus cannot determine the
exact amounts to be used for each specified purpose. However, we generally
anticipate spending between $22.0 million and $26.0 million on sales and
marketing in the current fiscal year and between $3.0 million and $4.0 million
on capital expenditures for the purposes of increasing our market share in the
design and implementation software market. In addition to using the proceeds
from this offering, we currently intend to fund our future expenses from our
existing cash balances and cash generated from our operations. The actual
amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of
factors, including the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive
and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business.
 
  We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire additional
businesses, services, products and technologies, that we believe will
complement our current or future business. However, we have no specific plans,
agreements or commitments to do so and are not currently engaged in any
negotiations for any acquisition or joint venture. As a result, we will retain
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering.
 
  Pending the uses described above, we will invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term interest bearing, investment-grade securities. We
believe that our available cash and net proceeds of this offering will be
sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next 12 months."

interest rate on our borrowings under the credit facility was 7.6%. Our existing
credit facility has a final maturity date of March 31, 2005. We used a portion

to public debt and equity markets. As of the date of this prospectus, we have no
specific plans to use the net proceeds from this offering other than as set
forth below.

     - approximately $4.5 million to repay the balance of our term loan
       facility; as of June 30, 2001, $5.2 million was outstanding under the
       facility, and
 
     - the balance of approximately $50.9 million for general corporate
       purposes, including potential acquisitions.

public offering. Otherwise, the Series E mandatorily redeemable preferred stock

purposes.

obtain a revolving credit facility in addition to a term loan and used the
borrowed funds to repay a May 1998 bank loan.

and related assets to increase our membership and expand into new service areas.
We intend to continue this strategy, and are actively looking for opportunities
that will complement our current operations. However, we currently have no
commitments or agreements with respect to any such transactions. We also expect

     AJS Bancorp, Inc. will purchase all of the capital stock of A. J. Smith
Federal to be issued in the reorganization in exchange for 50% of the net
proceeds of the offering. Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds will increase A. J.
Smith Federal's capital and will support the expansion of A. J. Smith Federal's
existing business activities, as described below.

     AJS Bancorp, Inc. intends to loan the employee stock ownership plan the
amount necessary to acquire shares of common stock at the time of the
reorganization and offering. The loan to the employee stock ownership plan will
be $606,000 and $944,000 at the minimum and maximum of the offering range,
respectively. See ""Management--Benefit Plans--Employee Stock Ownership Plan and
Trust.""

     The net proceeds available to A. J. Smith Federal will be used for general
corporate purposes, including the opening of a new branch in Orland Park. On a
short-term basis, A. J. Smith Federal may purchase United States Government
securities and mortgage-backed securities. The net proceeds received by A. J.
Smith Federal will further strengthen A. J. Smith Federal's capital position,
which currently exceeds regulatory requirements. After the offering, A. J. Smith
Federal's tangible capital ratio will be 11.10% if the common stock is sold at
the midpoint of the offering range. As a result, A. J. Smith Federal will
continue to be a well-capitalized institution.

     Initially, AJS Bancorp, Inc. will invest the remaining net proceeds
retained by it in United States Government and federal agency securities of
various maturities, deposits in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago or
deposits in other financial institutions. Depending on market conditions or
business opportunities available to AJS Bancorp, Inc. and A. J. Smith Federal,
the net proceeds may ultimately be used to:

     .    support A. J. Smith Federal's lending activities;

     .    support the expansion of our operations by opening or acquiring branch
          offices, other customer facilities or other financial institutions. At
          this time, we have purchased property which will be the location for
          our second branch office in Orland Park, Illinois. The branch is
          expected to open in 2002; or

     .    pay regular or special cash dividends, repurchase our common stock or
          pay returns of capital.


     We intend to consider stock repurchases, dividends and tax-free returns of
capital based on our earnings, capital and growth opportunities, and as
permitted by the Office of Thrift Supervision. A return of capital is similar to
a cash dividend, except for tax purposes it is an adjustment to your tax basis
rather than income to you. We may
not be eligible to pay a tax-free return of capital under Internal Revenue
Service regulations and we have committed to the Office of Thrift Supervision
that we will not pay a tax-free return of capital during the first year after we
complete the reorganization.

     The facts and circumstances under which we would consider repurchases of
our common stock may include but not be limited to the following:

     .    market and economic factors such as the price at which our stock is
          trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of
          other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk
          involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value
          and/or earnings per share of our common stock, and an improvement in
          our return on equity;

     .    the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue
          additional shares of our common stock to cover the exercise of stock
          options or to fund employee stock benefit plans;

     .    any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best
          interests of AJS Bancorp, Inc. and our stockholders.

     No stock will be repurchased by us unless A. J. Smith Federal continues to
exceed all applicable regulatory requirements after the repurchases. In
addition, during the first year following the reorganization, the Office of
Thrift Supervision will only allow us to purchase up to 5% of our common stock
and only if extraordinary circumstances exist to support the repurchase.

     Our net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the offering may be
more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds also will vary if the number
of shares to be issued in the offering is adjusted to reflect a change in the
estimated pro forma market value of A. J. Smith Federal. Payments for shares
made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at A. J. Smith Federal
will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by A. J. Smith
Federal; rather they will result in a reduction of A. J. Smith Federal's
interest expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing
certificates or other deposit accounts to purchase shares."

We currently intend to use approximately $35 million of the net proceeds to
repay the outstanding principal and interest under our existing credit facility
with IBJ Whitehall Business Credit and $60 million to make license payments to
American BioScience in connection with our license of the manufacturing and
sales rights to ABI-007. The IBJ credit facility expires in June 2003, and the
effective interest rate on borrowings was 9.4% and 7.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and the nine months ended September 30, 2001, respectively.
We are currently negotiating to enter into a $50 million revolving credit
facility and $25 million term loan, which we refer to in this prospectus as the
new credit facilities, with a syndicate of banks. If consummated prior to the
closing of this offering, we expect to use borrowings under the new credit
facilities to repay in full the IBJ credit facility and make an initial $15
million license payment to American BioScience. We would then expect to use
approximately $50 million (excluding certain fees and expenses related to the
new credit facilities) of the net proceeds from this offering to repay the new
term loan in full and the outstanding amount under the new revolving credit
facility, and $45 million to make an additional license payment to American
BioScience. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources.""
 
We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes,
including working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and
licensing opportunities. At this time, we do not have any commitments or
agreements with respect to any material acquisition. As of the date of this
prospectus, we have not allocated any specific amounts with respect to the
remaining net proceeds. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors, including:
 
 . the requirements of our product development and commercialization efforts
 
 . the need for capacity expansion and improvement
 
 . the need for information technology requirements
 
 . the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering
 
 . the amount of cash generated by our operations

particular uses of the remaining net proceeds. Our management will have
significant flexibility and discretion in applying the remaining net proceeds

   We intend to use our net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding
indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility. Assuming the completion
of this offering and our application of the net proceeds as intended, we would
have had $437.0 million outstanding under our senior secured credit facility as
of September 30, 2001. Our credit facility generally requires us to use all of
the net proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness. However, our credit
facility allows us to use the net proceeds from the offering for a limited
number of other purposes, including acquisitions, investments in foreign
subsidiaries, joint ventures and co-production programs, and capital
expenditures. While we have no current intention to use the proceeds for any of
these purposes, if the opportunity to use the net proceeds for any of these
purposes presents itself and we believe it is appropriate to do so, we may use
some or all of the net proceeds for one or more of those permitted purposes.
Our credit facility consists of a Term A loan that currently bears interest at
LIBOR + 3.00% per annum with a final maturity date of August 13, 2007, and a
Term B loan that currently bears interest at LIBOR + 3.25% per annum with a
final maturity date of August 13, 2009. We used the proceeds from the term
loans to pay a $289.7 million dividend to the holders of our common stock and
to complete a tender offer for our outstanding 8.75% senior subordinated notes.

the Elizabeth A. Brinn Foundation or of 525,000 shares of common stock by the
other selling stockholders to the underwriters to cover over-allotments, if any.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital,
to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate future access
to public debt and equity markets. We expect to use $4.0 million of our net
proceeds to repay all of the principal amount of our outstanding subordinated
notes at or shortly after the closing of this offering. The subordinated notes
bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.5% per year and mature in two equal
installments in September 2003 and 2004. We can repay the notes at any time
without premium or penalty. We issued these notes in September 1998 to
refinance notes that had been issued in 1993 to fund expansion opportunities
and statutory net worth requirement needs. An aggregate of $2.5 million of the
subordinated notes are held by Greylock Limited Partnership, which owns 31.4%
of our common stock and is an affiliate of our director, Howard E. Cox, Jr.;
$660,746 of the notes are held by the Elizabeth A. Brinn Foundation, which is
an affiliate of our directors Samuel E. Bradt, Claire W. Johnson and Richard P.
Wiederhold; and $235,499, $205,352 and $7,980 of the notes, respectively, are
held by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Wiederhold and Michael F. Neidorff, each of whom is
one of our directors. Mr. Neidorff is also our President and Chief Executive
Officer.

    We intend to use the remainder of our net proceeds for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions of businesses,
assets and technologies that are complementary to our business. For example, we
may use proceeds to acquire Medicaid and SCHIP contract rights and related
assets to increase our membership and to expand our business into new service
areas. Although we have evaluated possible acquisitions from time to time, we
currently have no commitments or agreements to make any acquisitions, and we
cannot assure you that we will make any acquisitions in the future. We also may
apply proceeds to fund working capital to:

   . increase market penetration within our current service areas;

   . pursue opportunities for the development of new markets;

   . expand services and products available to our members; and

   . strengthen our capital base by increasing the statutory capital of our
     health plan subsidiaries.

    We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically
for the foregoing purposes, other than for repayment of our subordinated notes.
As a result, our management will have broad discretion to allocate our net
proceeds of this offering. Pending application of our net proceeds, we intend
to invest our net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
instruments, repurchase agreements and high-grade corporate notes."

    .  fund our capital expenditures;

    .  fund our operations, including expenses related to our litigation with

use the remainder of the proceeds of this offering as working capital.
Specifically, we intend to use approximately $4.0 million of the net proceeds
of this offering in fiscal 2002 to open two international offices and up to

$5.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering in fiscal 2002 for sales and
marketing and general and administrative expenses, which includes increased
legal fees, directors and officers insurance and the costs of public company
compliance reporting. However, the amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures for working capital purposes will vary significantly depending on
a number of factors, including future revenue growth, the amount of cash we
generate from operations, if any, and the success of our current research and
development efforts. We do not currently have any material capital equipment
commitments relating to our planned expansion or otherwise. As a result, we
will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds from this

of the net proceeds for further development of our product lines and for
acquisitions of or investments in complementary products, technologies and
businesses. However, we currently have no commitments or agreements with
respect to any acquisitions or investments and have not begun negotiations for
any acquisitions or investments. We have not yet determined the manner in which
we will allocate the net proceeds with any certainty. Pending these uses, we
intend to invest the net proceeds in interest bearing, investment grade
government securities. This investment and any other investment, capital
expenditures, cash acquisition or other use we may make of the proceeds may not
produce the anticipated results."

million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses, or $743.3 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option in full.
 
   We intend to use approximately 56% of the gross proceeds of this offering
(assuming the stock buyback is completed at the public offering price) to fund
the stock buyback, and we intend to purchase up to 10% in the aggregate of the
outstanding shares of our Class A common stock in the stock buyback and the
aggregate funds to be used in the stock buyback will not exceed 75% of the
gross proceeds from this offering.
 
   We will determine the tender offer price, which may be at or above the
public offering price and at, above or below the market price at the time of
the tender offer. In the tender offer, each Class A stockholder will be
permitted to tender up to 13% of his or her shares of Class A common stock. If
the tender offer is fully subscribed by all Class A stockholders, we will
accept no more than 10% of each Class A stockholder's shares. In this manner,
tenders of up to 10% of a stockholder's shares will be accepted and to the
extent some stockholders tender less than 10% of their shares of Class A common
stock, then this shortfall will be allocated to the stockholders that have
tendered more than the 10% amount (but no more than 13%) on a pro rata basis.
The maximum aggregate number of shares of our Class A common stock that we may
purchase in the tender offer will vary depending on the tender offer price per
share. We currently intend to launch the tender offer as soon as practicable
after the completion of this offering.
 
   In the repurchase from the 401(k) Plans, we currently intend to agree, on
the date we execute the underwriting agreement relating to this offering, to
acquire up to 10% of the Class A common stock held by the 401(k) Plans. In
exchange for entering into this contract, the trustee for the 401(k) Plans will
agree not to tender in the tender offer. We anticipate that the price per share
under the contract with the 401(k) Plans will equal the public offering price.
However, if we tender for shares of Class A common stock in the tender offer at
a price higher than the public offering price, we will either make an
additional payment to the trustee for the difference on the date the tender
offer closes or we will return a portion of the shares sold to us by the 401(k)
Plans so that the effective price per share we pay under the contract equals
the tender offer price. Since the repurchase of shares under the contract with
the 401(k) Plans will close prior to the commencement of the tender offer, we
will complete the repurchase of shares from the 401(k) Plans even in the
unlikely event we elect not to proceed with the tender offer.
 
   If the price per share in the stock buyback exceeds the public offering
price per share of our unrestricted Class B common stock by an amount such that
the aggregate consideration for all shares purchased in the stock buyback would
exceed 75% of the gross proceeds from this offering, we will reduce the maximum
number of shares of our Class A common stock that may be tendered in the tender
offer and return shares of Class A common stock to the 401(k) Plans to limit
the aggregate consideration for all shares purchased in the stock buyback to
75% of the gross proceeds from this offering.
 
   We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering to repay part
of the new bridge financing facility we entered into to partly finance the
acquisition of ServiceMaster Management Services.
 
   Pending these uses, we intend to use all of the net proceeds to repay
indebtedness under our senior revolving credit facility and other bank debt.
Repayments of borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility will not
reduce the amount of commitments under this facility.
 
   Since we cannot specify with certainty the precise manner in which the net
proceeds will be allocated, we will have broad discretion in the application of
the net proceeds. We may use all or a greater portion of the net proceeds than
anticipated for general corporate purposes if fewer shares are tendered in the
proposed tender offer than anticipated.
 
   We had $420 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2001 under
the senior revolving credit facility. These loans mature in March 2005 and bear
interest at variable rates that reflect, at our option, LIBOR plus a spread
ranging from 0.18% to 0.70% per annum, the certificate of deposit rate plus a
spread ranging from 0.28% to 0.80% per annum or the higher of the prime rate or
0.50% per annum over the federal funds rate. In addition, the senior revolving
credit facility provides for a fee on the total amount of the facility, ranging
from 0.10% to 0.30% per annum. The spreads and fees are based on certain
financial ratios. The weighted average interest rate, including the commitment
fee, under the senior revolving credit facility was 4.05% on September 28,
2001.
 
   Our bridge financing facility is unsecured and matures in November 2002.
Interest under the bridge financing facility is based on, at our option, LIBOR
plus a spread ranging from 1.125% to 1.875% per annum and an initial spread of
1.375% (with the spread increasing by 0.25% after six months and by an
additional 0.25% after nine months) or the higher of the prime rate or 0.5% per
annum over the federal funds rate.
 
   We had $75 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2001 under
our credit agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and The Bank of
Nova Scotia. These loans mature in May 2005 and bear interest at variable rates
that reflect either LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.65% to 1.50% per annum
or the higher of the prime rate or 0.50% per annum over the federal funds rate.
The weighted average interest rate under this loan was 4.40% on September 28,
2001.
 
   We had $50 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2001 under
our credit agreement with KBC Bank. These loans mature in May 2005 and bear
interest at variable rates that reflect either LIBOR plus a spread ranging from
0.90% to 1.30% per annum or the higher of the prime rate or 0.50% per annum
over the federal funds rate. The spread is based on certain financial ratios.
The weighted average interest rate under this loan was 4.45% on September 28,
2001. We had $45 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2001
under our credit agreement with BNP Paribas. These loans mature in July 2003
and bear interest at variable rates that reflect LIBOR plus a spread of 0.85%
per annum. The weighted average interest rate under this loan was 4.68% on
September 28, 2001.
 
   In connection with our merger, the holders of the old Class A common stock
will be entitled to exercise appraisal rights, although a condition of the
merger is that holders of not more than 5% of our old Class A common stock
exercise appraisal rights. To the extent appraisal rights are exercised, a
portion of the proceeds of this offering may be used to satisfy our resulting
obligations."

      We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for 
general corporate purposes, including increased marketing and research and 
development expenditures, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions. We 
have no agreements with respect to material acquisitions as of the date of this 
prospectus. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. 

      A portion of the net proceeds may be used to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use 
complementary technologies."
