shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $49.1 
million, based on the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be 
approximately $56.7 million. 

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as 
follows: 

–> approximately $4.5 million to $5.0 million to complete preclinical and Phase
   1 clinical development of VS-507; 

–> approximately $5.0 million to $6.0 million to complete preclinical 
   development of VS-4718 and VS-5095 and Phase 1 clinical development of 
   whichever of these two product candidates we select to advance into human 
   clinical trials; 

–> approximately $6.0 million to $7.0 million for preclinical studies of our 
   other proprietary product candidates and companion diagnostics; 

–> approximately $11.0 million to $12.0 million for discovery, research and 
   preclinical studies of additional compounds; and 

–> the balance to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general 
   corporate purposes, which may include the acquisition or in-license of 
   additional compounds, product candidates or technology. 

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts 
and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on 
numerous factors, including the progress of our development efforts, the status
of and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may 
enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen 
cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the 
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current 
understandings, agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or 
licenses of any compounds, product candidates or technology. 

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering, we expect that
such funds, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete preclinical and Phase 1 clinical 
development of VS-507 and either VS-4718 or VS-5095 and, subject to 
successfully completing Phase 1 clinical development, complete a Phase 2 
clinical trial for one of VS-507, VS-4718 or VS-5095. However, it is possible 
that we will not achieve the progress that we expect because the actual costs 
and timing of research and development are difficult to predict, subject to 
substantial risks and delays and often vary depending on the particular 
indication and development strategy. We do not expect that the net proceeds 
from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be 
sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development of any of our 
product candidates. 

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-
term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government 
securities."
"GUIDEWIRE SOFTWARE, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/guidewire-software-inc-863116-68084,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/guidewire-software-inc-863116-68084,424B4,1/25/2012,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=8350974,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our sale of 8,850,000 shares of common 
stock in this offering at an initial public offering price of $13.00 per 
share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $103.0 million, or $119.0 
million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
common stock and to facilitate our access to public equity markets, as well 
as to obtain additional capital. Except as set forth in this section, we 
have no specific plans as to the use of a specific portion of the proceeds 
of this offering. However, we anticipate that we will use the net proceeds 
of this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working 
capital. We also intend to use certain of the net proceeds to satisfy tax 
withholding obligations related to the vesting of RSUs held by current or 
former employees, which will begin to vest 180 days after the completion of
this offering. We do not currently know the amount of net proceeds that will 
be used to satisfy these tax withholding obligations because it will be
dependent on a number of factors, including our stock price on the date of 
vesting and the number of shares underlying RSUs that vest on such date. At 
the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share, 1,210,702 shares 
underlying RSUs vesting on such date and the statutory minimum income tax 
rate for our employees, we would use $5.6 million to satisfy these tax 
withholding obligations. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed price of
our common stock on the date of vesting would increase (decrease) the amount 
we would be required to pay to satisfy these tax withholding obligations by 
$0.4 million. 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest 
in complementary companies, product lines, products or technologies. However, 
we have no understandings or agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
or investment. 

Pending their use, we plan to invest our net proceeds from this offering in 
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government."
"RENEWABLE ENERGY GROUP, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/renewable-energy-group-inc-804642-67691,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/renewable-energy-group-inc-804642-67691,424B4,1/20/2012,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=8345672,"We expect that the net proceeds we will receive from the sale of the shares of 
Common Stock offered by us will be approximately $60.9 million, after deducting
the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase 
additional shares from us is exercised in full, we estimate that we will 
receive additional net proceeds of approximately $10.0 million. We will not 
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the selling 
stockholders, although we will bear the costs, other than the underwriting 
discounts and commissions, associated with the sale of these shares. The 
selling stockholders include entities affiliated with or controlled by certain 
of our directors. 

We intend to use approximately $12.0 million of the net proceeds we receive 
from this offering to exercise the option we hold to acquire the Seneca 
facility, which we currently lease. The Seneca facility is beneficially owned 
by three of our stockholders: Bunge, USRG, and West Central. The option 
purchase price was determined through negotiation between the current 
beneficial owners and us in a transaction whereby we acquired the facility from
a third party in 2010 and immediately sold the facility to its current owners 
in a sale/leaseback transaction. We also have certain other arrangements and 
agreements in place with these parties. 

The remainder of the net proceeds is expected to be used for working capital, 
capital expenditures related to improvements of production processes and 
logistics, and investments, including potential acquisitions, joint ventures 
and other collaborative arrangements, in new biofuel businesses, production 
technologies or other assets and in opportunities to extend our biorefinery 
platform to the production of renewable chemicals and feedstocks. We have no 
agreements with respect to any material investments at this time. 

If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised, we are obligated to 
use the first $15.0 million of net proceeds, or such lesser amount if the net 
proceeds are less than $15.0 million, to make a one-time special payment to the
former holders of our Series A preferred stock. To the extent that the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised, or the net proceeds from 
the exercise of the over-allotment option are less than $15.0 million, upon 
expiration of the 30-day option period, we are obligated to issue up to 400,000
additional shares of Series B preferred stock to the former holders of Series A
preferred stock, such that the maximum number of shares of Series B preferred 
stock that we may issue is 3,000,000. The number of shares of Series B 
preferred stock to be issued to such former holders of Series A preferred stock
will be reduced proportionately for any exercise of the over-allotment option 
resulting in net proceeds in excess of $5.0 million and less than $15.0 
million. If the net proceeds from the exercise of the over-allotment option 
exceed $15.0 million, we intend to use such excess net proceeds as described 
in the preceding paragraphs. 

As of the date of this prospectus, however, except as set forth above, we 
cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of 
this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth 
above. Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net 
proceeds of this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, 
we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-
bearing, investment-grade securities."
"HOME LOAN SERVICING SOLUTIONS, LTD.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/home-loan-servicing-solutions-ltd-848844-66445,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/home-loan-servicing-solutions-ltd-848844-66445,424B4,2/29/2012,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=8451733,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be 
approximately $170 million after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions, an advisory services fee and estimated offering expenses that we
must pay. 

Concurrently with this offering, William C. Erbey, the founder of our company 
and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, has agreed to purchase $10 
million of our ordinary shares in the Concurrent Private Placement at a price
per share equal to the initial public offering price, subject to the 
completion of this offering. No underwriting discounts or commissions will
be paid in respect of these shares. 

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will purchase the Rights to MSRs, 
associated servicing advances and related assets from Ocwen Loan Servicing. 
We will also assume Ocwen Loan Servicing’s obligations under the existing 
advance financing facility. The closing of these transactions will occur 
simultaneously with and is a condition precedent to the closing of the 
Offerings. The estimated purchase price for these assets is $150 million (net 
of assumed match funded liabilities of $361 million and subject to certain 
closing adjustments). The outstanding amount owed on the advance financing 
facility was $383 million as of December 31, 2011. 

The purchase price has two components. The purchase price for the Rights to 
MSRs will be based on our estimates of the value of such assets at the time
we entered into the Purchase Agreement and the outstanding unpaid principal 
balance of the underlying mortgage loans at closing. The purchase price for 
the associated servicing advances and other assets (such as the capitalized 
debt issue costs and facility reserve account) will be equal to the net 
consolidated book value as of the purchase date of all assets and liabilities 
of the special purpose entities established in connection with the advanced 
financing facility that owns these servicing advances, namely HomEq Servicer 
Advance Facility Transferor, LLC (“HomEq Transferor”) and HomEq Servicer 
Advance Receivables Trust 2010-ADV1 (the “Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust 
of which HomEq Transferor is the sole beneficiary. We have agreed to pay 
Barclays Bank PLC, an affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc., a conversion fee 
related to our assumption of the existing advance financing facility equal
 to 0.75% of the sum of (a) the aggregate principal balance of the Class A-1,
Class B and Class C Notes outstanding on the closing date plus (b) the maximum
principal balance of the Class A-2 Note. 

We have obtained an opinion from MIAC relating to the fairness to us, from
a financial point of view, of the purchase price to be paid by us for the 
assets acquired in connection with the Initial Acquisition. MIAC has indicated
that the methodologies and analyses used to value Rights to MSRs are 
substantially similar to those used in connection with the valuation of 
mortgage servicing rights. As a result, MIAC does not believe that the 
structure of the Initial Acquisition has a material impact on its assessment 
of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the purchase price to us. 
MIAC’s analysis, as more fully described in its fairness opinion, is based on 
an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows of the Initial 
Mortgage Servicing Rights utilizing assumptions that MIAC believes are 
reasonable and consistent with mortgage servicing industry best practices in 
valuing mortgage servicing assets. The most significant assumptions used are 
estimates of the speed at which mortgages will prepay and the aggregate 
principal amount of mortgage loans that will become delinquent. Other 
significant assumptions used in MIAC’s analysis include the discount rate and
the interest expense for financing servicing advances. The assumptions used 
in the analysis are summarized below: 

• Discount rates reflecting the yield requirements of future income streams
 from the Rights to MSRs ranging from 14% to 22%. 
 
• Interest rate used for calculating the cost of servicing advances of 1-month
 LIBOR + 4%. 
 
• Mortgage loan prepayment projections ranging from 12% to 25% of the related
 mortgage lifetime projected prepayment rate. 
 
• Delinquency rate projections ranging from 15% to over 35% of the aggregate
 unpaid balance of the underlying mortgage loans. 
 
MIAC reviewed the collateral attributes and the historical payment performance
of the Initial Mortgage Servicing Rights and compared it with similar 
mortgage servicing portfolios and with standard industry mortgage performance
benchmarks to arrive at the assumptions set forth above. The selected 
collateral attributes and performance comparisons MIAC utilized were the 
voluntary prepayment performance, delinquency and foreclosure performance, 
operational cost comparison, average loan balance, weighted average coupon 
and note rate distribution, loan product type classification, geographic 
distribution and servicing advance behavior. 

In addition, within the evaluation of the purchase price of the Rights to 
MSRs, MIAC has assumed, based upon a comparison of similar transactions, 
that servicing advances and other assets related to the Initial Mortgage 
Service Assets will be valued and realized at book value. 

We paid MIAC a fee of $300,000 for the delivery of its fairness opinion. 
Amounts paid by us or our affiliates to MIAC were $152,000 and $134,000 in 
2011 and 2010, respectively. 

We will automatically acquire legal ownership of the Initial Mortgage 
Servicing Rights without any additional payment to Ocwen Loan Servicing if 
and when we obtain the Required Third Party Consents and therefore, no 
proceeds from the Offerings will be used for that purpose. 

We intend to use any remaining net proceeds from the Offerings for working 
capital and general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of 
indebtedness or the purchase of additional Rights to MSRs or mortgage 
servicing rights."

by us. If the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option, we 
estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately 
$71.6 million. 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also use 
a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets, as well as add 
incremental capacity. However, we have no current commitments or obligations 
to do so. Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing 
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct 
or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. 

By establishing a public market for our common stock, this offering is also 
intended to facilitate our future access to public markets."

(1)  Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
     shares in connection with our consummation of our initial Business 
     Combination.  

(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a 
     $100,000 loan from ROIC Acquisition Holdings LP, our sponsor. This loan 
     will be repaid upon consummation of this offering out of the $625,000 of 
     offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
     expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering 
     expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be 
     used for post-closing working capital expenses.  

(3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer $2,250,000 of their underwriting 
     commissions (or $2,587,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
     exercised in full), which equals 3% of the gross proceeds from the units 
     offered to the public, until consummation of initial Business Combination.
     Upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, $2,250,000, which 
     constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $2,587,500 if the 
     underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to 
     the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the 
     remaining funds will be released to us.  

(4)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
     of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
     example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our 
     current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our 
     initial Business Combination based upon the level of complexity of such 
     Business Combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a 
     specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
     expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
     legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, 
     we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial 
     due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of 
     proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
     allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
     estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available 
     for our expenses. Based on the current interest rate environment, we 
     anticipate that approximately $150,000 will be available to us from 
     interest income to be earned on the funds held in the trust account. The 
     interest rate used to calculate the $150,000 of interest was calculated 
     using an assumed semi-annual interest rate of approximately 0.05% on the 
     trust account over 21 months.  

A total of $75,100,000 (or $86,068,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the 
sale of the sponsor warrants described in this prospectus, including $2,250,000
(or $2,587,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the 
United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and that invest solely in U.S. 
Treasuries. Except for the interest income that may be released to us to fund 
our working capital requirements, as discussed below, and any amounts necessary
to purchase up to 15% of our public shares if we seek stockholder approval of 
our Business Combination as will be permitted under the investment management 
trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & 
Trust Company, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released 
from the trust account until the earlier of: (1) the completion of our initial 
Business Combination within 21 months after the closing of this offering and 
(2) the redemption of 100% of our public shares prior to any voluntary winding-
up in the event we do not complete a Business Combination within 21 months 
after the closing of this offering. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial 
Business Combination. If our initial Business Combination is paid for using 
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our 
Business Combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account 
that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, 
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating the initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital. Although we believe that the net proceeds of 
this offering, including the interest earned on the proceeds held in the trust 
account that may be available to us for our initial Business Combination, will 
be sufficient to allow us to consummate our initial Business Combination, 
because we have not yet identified any prospective target business we cannot 
ascertain the capital requirements, if any, for any particular transaction or 
the sources of such potential financing. Such financing may not be available 
on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment has made it 
especially difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the 
extent additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate 
our initial Business Combination, we would be compelled to either restructure 
the transaction or abandon that particular initial Business Combination and 
seek an alternative target business candidate. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income that 
may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to 
pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target
business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake 
in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant 
prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of 
intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial 
Business Combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-
depth due diligence and negotiating our initial Business Combination is less 
than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available
to use from the trust account is less than $150,000 as a result of the current 
interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the 
amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this 
event, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional 
investments from members of our management team, but such members of our 
management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in,
us. 

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the Nasdaq, we 
have agreed to pay the Clinton Group, an affiliate of our sponsor, a total of 
$10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and 
administrative services. This arrangement is being agreed to by the Clinton 
Group for our benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor compensation 
in lieu of salary or other remuneration. We believe that such fees are at least
as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon 
completion of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will 
cease paying these monthly fees. 

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced to us a total of 
$100,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These 
advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of 
March 31, 2012 and the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon 
the closing of this offering out of the $625,000 of offering proceeds that has 
been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial Business Combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial Business 
Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial 
Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering 
proceeds held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up 
to $500,000 of such loans may be converted into warrants of the post Business 
Combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender,
upon the sole discretion of the lender. The terms of such warrants would 
otherwise be identical to the sponsor warrants. The terms of such loans by our 
officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written 
agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

Unlike many blank check companies, if we seek stockholder approval of our 
initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection 
with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, prior to the 
consummation of our initial Business Combination, the investment management 
trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & 
Trust Company will permit the release to us from the trust account of amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 15% of the shares sold in this offering (1,125,000 
shares, or 1,293,750 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) commencing two business days after the filing of a 
preliminary proxy statement for our initial Business Combination and ending on 
the business day immediately preceding the record date for the vote to be held 
to approve our initial Business Combination. Purchases will be made only in 
open market transactions at times when we are not in possession of any material
non-public information. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 
10b-18. Purchases under Rule 10b-18 are subject to certain conditions, 
including with respect to the manner of sale (sales are required to be effected
through one broker on a single day, subject to certain exceptions), timing 
(purchases are subject to certain restrictions at the beginning and end of the 
trading session), pricing (the purchase price may not exceed the highest 
independent bid or the last independent transaction price, whichever is higher)
and volume of purchases (the total volume of Rule 10b-18 purchases effected by 
us or any affiliated purchasers on any single day generally must not exceed 25%
of the average daily trading volume of our common stock). If the conditions of 
Rule 10b-18, as in effect at the time we wish to make such purchases, are not 
satisfied, we will not make such purchases. Any purchases we make will be at 
prices (inclusive of commissions) not to exceed the per-share amount then held 
in the trust account ($10.00 per share or approximately $9.97 per share if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). We can purchase any 
or all of the 1,125,000 shares (or 1,293,750 shares if the underwriters’ over-
allotment option is exercised in full) we are entitled to purchase. It will be 
entirely in our discretion as to how many shares are purchased. If investors 
elect not to sell their shares of common stock separately from their units, we 
may be unable to purchase any or all of the 1,125,000 shares (or 1,293,750 
shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) we are 
entitled to purchase. Purchasing decisions will be made based on various 
factors, including the then current market price of our common stock and the 
terms of the proposed Business Combination. All shares purchased by us will be
immediately cancelled. Such open market purchases, if any, would be conducted 
by us to minimize any disparity between the then current market price of our 
common stock and the per-share amount held in the trust account. A market price
below the per-share trust amount could provide an incentive for purchasers to 
buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary proxy statement at a 
discount to the per-share amount held in the trust account for the sole purpose
of voting against our initial Business Combination and exercising redemption 
rights for the full per share amount held in the trust account. Such trading 
activity could enable such investors to block our initial Business Combination 
by making it difficult for us to obtain the approval of such Business 
Combination by the vote of a majority of our outstanding common stock. 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, we may enter into privately negotiated transactions to 
purchase public shares from stockholders following consummation of the initial 
Business Combination with proceeds released to us from the trust account 
immediately following consummation of the initial Business Combination. Our 
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates also may purchase shares in 
privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation
of our initial Business Combination. Although we do not currently anticipate 
paying any premium purchase price (over the trust value) for such public 
shares, in the event we do, the payment of a premium may not be in the best 
interest of those stockholders not receiving any such premium. In addition, the
payment of a premium by us after the consummation of our initial Business 
Combination may not be in the best interest of the remaining stockholders who 
do not redeem their shares. Such stockholders may experience a reduction in 
book value per share compared to the value received by stockholders that have 
their shares purchased by us at a premium. Except for the limitations described
above on use of trust proceeds released to us prior to consummating our initial
Business Combination, there is no limit on the amount of shares that could be 
acquired by us or our affiliates, or the price we or they may pay, if we hold a
stockholder vote. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our 
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption 
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial 
Business Combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the Business Combination, and instead may search for an 
alternate Business Combination. 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (1) our consummation of our initial Business
Combination, and then only in connection with those shares of common stock that
such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations 
described herein or (2) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate our initial Business Combination within 21 months following the 
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described 
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) 
created by the terms of the proposed Business Combination. In no other 
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind 
to or in the trust account. 

Our sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its 
founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our 
initial Business Combination. In addition, our sponsor has agreed to waive its 
right to liquidating distributions with respect to its founder shares if we 
fail to consummate our initial Business Combination within 21 months after the 
closing of this offering. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, 
directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they 
will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such 
public shares if we fail to consummate our initial Business Combination within 
the required time period."

stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of $12.00 per 
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses, will be approximately $97.0 million or $112.8 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full. We will not receive 
any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling 
stockholders. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
common stock, obtain additional capital, facilitate our future access to the 
public equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential 
clients and improve our competitive position. 

We do not have current specific plans for the use of the net proceeds from this
offering. However, we generally intend to use the balance of the net proceeds 
from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We
also may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or license, or invest in,
products, services, technologies or other businesses. The amount and timing of 
these expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors, including 
competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of 
our business. 

Pending their use, we plan to invest our net proceeds from this offering in 
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering to us, and investors will be relying on the 
judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds."

$56.5 million, based upon the initial public offering price of $13.00 per

estimated offering expenses payable by us. 
  
If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in 
full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $65.5 million, 
based upon the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share and after 
deducting net underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following: 

Research and development		                  $	30.0 million	

Capital expenditures primarily relating to 
breeding stations, production facilities, 
systems and agricultural equipment		          $	5.0 million	

Commercial activities, including increasing 
the number of sales and marketing personnel, 
expanding our advertising and branding efforts 
and pursuing government approvals		          $	 5.0 million	

Working capital and other general corporate 
purposes, including seed production efforts and 
operating as a public company		                  $	16.5 million

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to expand our business through 
acquisitions of other companies, assets or technologies, which we expect 
would reduce the amount of net proceeds available for working capital and 
other general corporate purposes. However, we do not have any present 
understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any potential 
agreements for any acquisitions. Pending the uses of the net proceeds of 
this offering, as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. 
  
Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public 
market for our common stock, increase our visibility in the marketplace and 
provide liquidity to existing stockholders. Creating a public market for 
our common stock will facilitate our ability to raise additional equity 
in the future and to use our common stock as a means of attracting and 
retaining key employees and as consideration for acquisitions."

stock in this offering will be approximately $47.4 million, based on the 
initial public offering price of $11.00 per share, and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, or 
$40.4 million after the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase additional shares in this 
offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately $55.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, or $48.0 million 
after the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. 

The principal reasons for this offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to public equity markets. We currently estimate that of the net proceeds we 
receive from this offering we will spend approximately $7.0 million to repay 
the outstanding principal under our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. 
Our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank consists of an asset based line of
credit with a maturity date of March 31, 2013, which accrues interest at the 
prime rate plus 1.5%, and a term loan line of credit that has a maturity date 
of 48 months from the date a term advance is made and which accrues interest at
the prime rate plus 7%. We have used our credit facility for general working 
capital purposes and to secure a $2.4 million letter of credit for the lease of
our corporate headquarters. 

We anticipate that we will use the remaining net proceeds we receive from this 
offering, including any net proceeds we receive from the exercise of the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option, for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes, funding of our marketing activities and the costs of 
operating as a public company and further investment in the development of our 
proprietary technologies. We may use a portion of the net proceeds for the 
acquisition of businesses, products and technologies that we believe are 
complementary to our own, although we have no agreements or understandings with
respect to any acquisition at this time. We have not allocated any specific 
portion of the remaining net proceeds to any particular purpose, and our 
management will have the discretion to allocate the proceeds as it determines. 
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds to us from the 
offering in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade and interest-bearing instruments."

offering will be approximately $75.2 million, based upon the sale of 1,896,442
shares of our common stock by us in this offering at $44.00 per share, after 
deducting the underwriter’s discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. This estimated amount of net proceeds assumes that 
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised. If the 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, our net proceeds are expected to 
increase by approximately $11.7 million. 

We intend to contribute approximately $ 44.0 million of aggregate net proceeds
from this offering to the Bank as equity capital. While this capital 
contribution will not be sufficient to allow the Bank to comply with the 
minimum capital ratio requirements of the Bank Order, it will improve our 
capital position and bring the Bank closer to compliance with these 
requirements. However, we believe that following the contribution to the 
Bank of at least $44.0 million in capital from this offering and subject to 
the successful completion of an on-site examination of the Bank by our primary
regulators confirming our condition, we will qualify for replacement of the 
Bank Order with another form of enforcement agreement between the Bank and 
our regulators which we expect would include provisions for maintenance of 
at least an 8.5% Tier 1 capital ratio and continued improvement in the Bank’s 
asset quality. We expect that we will continue to face significant 
restrictions on our operations under both the Bank Order and any other 
enforcement agreement that replaces the Bank Order. 

We anticipate that a contribution of approximately $44.0 million of the 
aggregate net proceeds from this offering, together with the Bank’s 
preliminary earnings for January and expected earnings in February, will be 
adequate to bring the Bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio to no less than 8.5%.
However, if management determines that a greater or lesser amount would be 
necessary to reach that targeted capital ratio taking into account, among 
other things, changes in the average assets and variations in the Bank’s net 
income that may affect our regulatory capital ratios, we may adjust the actual 
amount of the contribution, up to the aggregate net proceeds. 

The remaining proceeds will be used by HomeStreet, Inc., for general corporate 
purposes. 

The amount and timing of the actual use of proceeds described above may vary 
significantly and depend on a number of factors."

matures in May 2016 and accrues interest at either (x) the Base Rate plus four 
and one-half percent (4.50%) per annum or (y) the LIBOR Rate plus five and one-

million. 

We intend to use all of the net proceeds that we receive from this offering, 
together with borrowings under our new senior credit facility, to repay all of 
our outstanding borrowings under our existing first lien credit facility and 
second lien credit facility, including all accrued interest thereon and any 
related prepayment premiums. Assuming we had completed this offering as of the 
latest balance sheet date of October 1, 2011 and assuming net proceeds from 
this offering of $111.15 million, we would have incurred borrowings of 
approximately $675 million under our new senior credit facility. The actual 
amount of indebtedness that we incur under our new senior credit facility as of
the completion of this offering will vary from this amount based on several 
factors, including changes in the principal amounts outstanding and accrued 
interest and any related prepayment premiums under our existing credit 
facilities and the amount of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 
new senior credit facility. For example, subsequent to October 1, 2011, we used
approximately $54 million of our existing cash to make a scheduled principal 
payment on the term loan portion of our existing first lien credit facility. 

As of October 1, 2011, the outstanding indebtedness under our first lien credit
facility was $689 million and the outstanding indebtedness under our second 
lien credit facility was $150 million. We used the net proceeds from our 
borrowings under the second lien credit facility to fund a dividend to our 
equity holders in the Recapitalization Transaction. As of October 1, 2011, the 
weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the first lien credit 
facility was 6.75% per annum and the interest rate for the second lien credit 
facility was 10% per annum. Our outstanding borrowings under the term loan 
portion of our existing first lien credit facility are due in quarterly 
installments of approximately $1.7 million from December 2011 to September 2013
and a one-time payment of the remaining balance is due in November 2013. Our 
outstanding borrowings under our second lien credit facility are due in April 
2016. 

Affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering, together 
with the proceeds from the sale of our concurrent private placements to 
GSK and Techne as follows: 

• Approximately $25.0 million to further develop CCX140, including the 
completion of the two Phase II clinical trials in diabetic nephropathy and 
additional Phase I clinical trials and related activities in anticipation 
of conducting end-of-Phase II meetings with the FDA and EMA; 
 
• Approximately $10.0 million to advance CCX168 and CCX662 through Phase 
II clinical proof-of-concept and to further explore our ChemR23 program, 
including the possible optimization of ChemR23 antagonist leads; 
 
• Approximately $10.0 million to fund our research and drug discovery 
activities related to additional drug candidates; and 
 
• The remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, 
including hiring of additional personnel and expenses associated with 
being a public company. 
 
However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development 
process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts 
of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placements to GSK and Techne that may be used for the above purposes. 
Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net 
proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements. 
The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors including the results of our research and development efforts, 
the timing and success of preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical 
trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future, the timing of 
regulatory submissions and the amount of cash, if any, generated by our 
collaboration agreement. 

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering and the concurrent 
private placement, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit 
or government securities."

approximately US$219.4 million, or US$252.7 million if the underwriters 
exercise the over-allotment option in full, after deducting the underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The 
following estimates assume the underwriters do not exercise the over-allotment
option and holders of investment shares do not exercise the right to subscribe
additional investment shares in the preemptive rights offer. 

We intend to use approximately 50.0% of the net proceeds from this offering 
for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes to grow our 
core cement business. The capital expenditures will include the increase of 
cement production capacity of our Rioja facility, which is currently operating
at near full capacity, and part of the construction of a cement plant in 
Piura based on the results of our pre-feasibility and engineering studies. 
We believe that our expansion plans will allow us to meet projected increases 
in demand for cement in coming years, help us deepen our commercial 
relationships in regional areas in our market, reduce transportation costs, 
and secure our leadership position in the northern region of Peru. We 
routinely evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities that are aligned 
with our strategic goals, so we may also acquire, or invest in, businesses, 
technologies or products that are complementary to our core business. We will 
have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this offering. 

We currently also expect to use approximately 50.0% of the net proceeds from
 this offering toward capital expenditures required to develop our phosphate 
and brine projects. Our preliminary estimates of the investments required to
 develop these projects are in the range of US$350 to US$400 million for 
phosphate and in the range of US$250 to US$300 million for brine. These 
estimates, however, are based on limited preliminary work and are subject to 
change. We have not developed a specific timetable for the development of 
these projects and our use of proceeds may vary depending on the progress and 
ongoing evaluation of these projects. We expect to finance these projects with
a combination of the net proceeds from this offering, new borrowings and 
financial contributions from current or future minority partners. We will 
have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering to 
these projects. 

Pending application of the net proceeds, we expect to invest the proceeds in 
low-risk marketable securities, bank deposits and money market funds."

million. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to 
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to 
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We expect to use 
the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes: 

•     $22.0 million to conduct and complete our planned Phase 3 trial for the
 oral formulation of CEM-101; 
 
•     $4.0 million to complete our ongoing Phase 1 trial for the IV
 formulation of CEM-101; 
 
•     $3.0 million to fund formulation and manufacturing of drug product; 
 
•     $4.0 million to fund our planned Phase 2 trial for Taksta for the
 treatment of prosthetic joint infections; and 
 
•     the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
 including for additional costs and expenses associated with being a public
 company. 
 
To support our planned NDA for the oral and IV formulations of CEM-101 for 
the treatment of CABP, we estimate that we will need approximately $9.2 
million to conduct a number of studies to support FDA approval of CEM-101, 
including a thorough QT, or TQT, study to look at cardiac effects, and 
studies in patients with hepatic insufficiency and approximately $3.6 million 
to acquire the API for our planned Phase 3 trials for the IV formulation of 
CEM-101. Based on the approximately $46.3 million in net proceeds from this 
offering, we will need to raise additional capital for those activities. 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the ongoing status and results of the CEM-101 and Taksta 
clinical trials. We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our 
existing cash and equivalents, together with interest thereon and our 
expected draw of the $10.0 million available under the Hercules loan, will 
be sufficient to fund our operations into 2014. 

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade 
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of 
the U.S. government."

net proceeds to us will be approximately $57.2 million. We will not receive 
any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to pay (a) $23.3 million 
consisting of a cash payment to holders of our outstanding preferred stock 
concurrently with the conversion of such shares into shares of common stock 
upon the closing of this offering (excluding those holders who have elected 
in connection with the conversion to receive all or a portion of such payment

The Company currently does not have any pending material acquisitions. We will 
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 

In connection with the Reincorporation and consummation of this offering, all 
outstanding shares of Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will 
be converted into shares of common stock. Each share of Series A Preferred 
Stock will convert into 1.263 shares of the Company’s common stock, while 
each share of Series B Preferred Stock will convert into one share of the 
Company’s common stock. In connection with such conversion, each Series A 
Preferred stockholder will receive a payment of $6 per preferred share and 
each Series B Preferred stockholder will receive $4.75 per preferred share, 
which holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may 
elect to receive in the form of shares of the Company’s common stock in an 
amount equal to the quotient obtained by the dividing (i) the total amount 
of the payment then due to such holder of Preferred Stock by (ii) the per 
share price of the Company’s common stock based on the initial price to the 
public in this offering. Accordingly, consistent with payment elections 
previously received by the Company, the holders of our Series A and Series 
B Convertible Preferred Stock will receive cash payments totaling $23.3 
million as well as a total of 1,870,124 of common shares. Upon consummation 
of the Reincorporation and the closing of this offering, we will no longer 
have any preferred stock outstanding. 

Pending the foregoing uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in 
high-quality, investment grade U.S. government-backed obligations. The 
actual use of the proceeds may vary significantly and will depend on a 
number of factors, including our future revenue and cash generated by

the common stock offered by us after deducting estimated expenses of 
approximately $3.0 million and estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
of approximately $9.4 million. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately 
$135.4 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our
common stock by the selling shareholders, including with respect to any sale of
shares by the selling shareholders as a result of the exercise of the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option. 

Initially, we intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering to 
repay the then outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement ($123.0 
million outstanding at January 27, 2012, excluding outstanding letters of 
credit). Following the application of the net proceeds we receive from this 
offering, we will have approximately $98.7 million available for potential 
future borrowings under our credit agreement (after giving effect to 
outstanding letters of credit). We intend to use the remaining net proceeds 
from this offering, our cash from operations and available borrowings under our
credit agreement to fund our 2012 capital expenditure requirements. As a result
of our anticipated increases in production and reserves, we expect to have a 
sufficient increase in our cash flows from operations during the year ending 
December 31, 2012, as compared to our cash flows from operations in prior 
periods, as well as a sufficient increase in the borrowing base under our 
credit agreement to help fund our 2012 capital expenditure budget. A majority 
of our anticipated increase in cash flows during the year ending December 31, 
2012 is expected to come from our exploration activities on unproved properties
at September 30, 2011 in the Eagle Ford shale play assuming such exploration 
activities are successful. These anticipated increases in our cash flows from 
operations are based upon current oil and natural gas prices and the hedges we 
currently have in place. If our exploration activities result in less cash 
flows than anticipated, we may seek additional sources of capital, including 
through borrowings under our credit agreement (assuming availability under our 
borrowing base) or from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. 
In addition, we may modify our planned capital expenditure budget for 2012 
accordingly. Exploration activities are subject to a number of risks and 
uncertainties that could impact our ability to sufficiently increase our 
reserves, cash flows from operations and borrowing base under our credit 
agreement. Although we have no current plans or proposals, pending application 
of the portion of our net proceeds to fund our 2012 capital expenditure 
requirements, we may be presented with other opportunities for acquisitions of 
interests or acreage. In that case, we may decide to use a portion of the net 
proceeds to finance these acquisitions and use cash flows from operations or 
additional borrowings under our credit agreement to fund our 2012 capital 
expenditure requirements, when necessary. 

We intend to use the following amounts of the net proceeds for the above uses: 

Use of Net Proceeds                                                Amount

Repayment of senior secured revolving credit agreement             $  123.0  
Payment of a portion of 2012 capital expenditure requirements           4.6 
       
Total net proceeds                                                 $  127.6

In December 2011, we amended and restated our senior secured revolving credit 
agreement. This amendment increased the maximum facility amount from $150 
million to $400 million. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of $400 million 
or the borrowing base, which will be $100 million immediately following this 
offering. Comerica Bank serves as administrative agent of our credit agreement,
which matures in December 2016. At January 27, 2012, all borrowings under our 
credit agreement bore interest at a variable rate of 3.25% plus a Eurodollar-
based rate per annum, which equated to approximately 3.5% per annum. Affiliates
of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our senior secured revolving 
credit agreement and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the proceeds from 
this offering. 

Borrowings under the credit agreement were incurred from December 2010 through 
January 2012 to finance acquisitions of acreage and ongoing drilling and 
completion operations. Upon consummation of this offering and application of 
the net proceeds we receive in the manner described above, we will have 
available borrowings under our credit agreement to finance our capital 
expenditure requirements. We anticipate that we may need to access future 
borrowings under our credit agreement within 30 days following completion of 
this offering to fund a portion of our 2012 capital expenditure requirements 
in excess of amounts available from our cash flows and the net proceeds of this
offering. 

The selling shareholders will receive net proceeds of approximately $18.8 
million from their sale of 1,666,667 shares of common stock in this offering, 
or approximately $33.4 million if the underwriters exercise their over-
allotment option in full, and in each case after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions. We will pay all expenses related to 
this offering, other than underwriting discounts and commissions related to the
shares sold by the selling shareholders. Certain selling shareholders that are 
selling 243,460 shares in this offering will not be required to pay 
underwriting discounts or commissions. 

While we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering in the manner 
described above, including for potential acquisitions of interests and/or 
acreage (although we have no current plans to do so), the ultimate amount of 
capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions and 
our drilling results. Our future financial condition and liquidity will be 
impacted by, among other factors, our level of production of oil and natural 
gas and the prices we receive from the sale thereof, the outcome of our 
exploration and drilling programs, the number of commercially viable oil and 
natural gas discoveries made and the quantities of oil and natural gas 
discovered, the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to production, 
and the actual cost of exploration and development of our oil and natural gas 
assets. We intend to invest any net proceeds from this offering that exceed the
pay off amount of our credit agreement as described above in U.S. treasury 
bonds or investment grade instruments until otherwise needed."

after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us but prior to the payment of accrued dividends 
on our series B convertible preferred stock. If the underwriters exercise 
their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from 
this offering will be approximately $107.5 million. 

As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 
$50.5 million. We will use approximately $4.3 million of the net proceeds 
from this offering to pay accrued dividends on our series B convertible 
preferred stock. We currently estimate that we will use the balance of the 
net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and cash equivalents 
as of December 31, 2011, as follows: 

. approximately $30.0 million to $40.0 million to fund our ongoing clinical 
program for MM-398, including approximately $12.0 million to $16.0 million of 
external costs for our Phase 3 clinical trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer, 
and to seek marketing approval and begin commercialization activities for 
MM-398 in the United States; 

• approximately $16.0 million to $22.0 million to fund our ongoing clinical 
program for MM-111; 

• approximately $14.0 million to $18.0 million to fund our ongoing clinical 
program for MM-302; 

• approximately $11.0 million to $15.0 million to fund our ongoing clinical 
program for MM-151; 

• approximately $30.0 million to $45.0 million to fund other research and 
development efforts, including beginning human clinical trials for new 
compounds; and 

• the balance, if any, to fund working capital, capital expenditures and 
other general corporate purposes, which may include the acquisition or 
licensing of other products, businesses or technologies. 

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing 
cash and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current 
plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual 
expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including 
the progress of our development and commercialization efforts, the status of 
and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may 
enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen 
cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the 
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current 
understandings, agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or 
licenses of any products, businesses or technologies. 

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our
existing cash and cash equivalents described above, we expect that such funds 
will be sufficient to enable us to complete enrollment in the Phase 3 clinical 
trial of MM-398 in metastatic pancreatic cancer. 

However, it is possible that we will not achieve the progress that we expect 
because the actual costs and timing of development, particularly clinical 
trials, are difficult to predict, subject to substantial risks and delays 
and often vary depending on the particular indication and development 
strategy. Sanofi is responsible for all development and manufacturing costs 
under our collaboration for the development and commercialization of MM-121. 
We do not expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing 
cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund the
completion of development of any of our product candidates. 

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government 
securities."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $107.4 
million, or approximately $115.6 million if the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, based upon the initial public offering price 
of $13.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the 
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders, although we 
will bear the costs, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, 
associated with those sales. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets,
as well as to obtain additional capital. We intend to use the net proceeds 
from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, 
including further expansion of our international operations and product 
development. 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to 
acquire, invest in or license complementary products, technologies or 
businesses, but we currently have no agreements or commitments with respect 
to any potential acquisition, investment or in-license. We may allocate funds 
from other sources to fund some or all of these activities. 

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with 
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the 
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly, 
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds 
of this offering. 

The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many 
factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of 
our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this 
offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short- 
and intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our access to the 
public capital markets. 

We currently intend to use our proceeds from this offering for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. The 
amount and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of 
factors, including competitive and technological developments and the rate
of growth, if any, of our business. In addition, we may use a portion of 
the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products 
or technologies, including in connection with our proposed acquisition of 
substantially all of the assets of Logo’d Softwear, Inc.; however, we do not 
currently have any understandings or agreements relating to any significant 
acquisitions or investments other than for Logo’d Softwear, Inc.

million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other 
estimated expenses of $27.3 million payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive (i) to redeem up to $300.0 
million in aggregate principal amount of our 11.75% senior subordinated notes 
due 2016 plus pay early redemption premiums of $17.6 million and approximately 
$7.4 million of accrued interest, (ii) to pay Apollo or its affiliates a fee 
of $15.0 million (plus any unreimbursed expenses) upon the consummation of 
this offering in connection with the termination of our management services 
agreement, as described under “Certain Relationships and Related Party 
Transactions—Management Services Fee,” and (iii) for general corporate 
purposes. As of December 31, 2011, we had $300.0 million in aggregate 
principal amount of our 11.75% senior subordinated notes outstanding, which 
bear interest at a rate of 11.75% per annum and mature on August 1, 2016. 

Any net proceeds used to redeem all $300.0 million of outstanding aggregate 
principal amount of our 11.75% senior subordinated notes would be first 
contributed by the Company to RBS Global so that RBS Global may effect such 
redemption. Pending the application of the net proceeds of this offering, as 
described above, all or a portion of the net proceeds of this offering may 
be invested by us in short-term interest bearing investments. 

Our affiliates, including Mr. Sherman (our Non-Executive Chairman) and Messrs.
Adams and Jeyarajah (both of whom are executive officers), who are holders of 
our 11.75% senior subordinated notes will receive net proceeds from this 
offering in connection with the repayment of such indebtedness. As of the date 
of this prospectus these affiliates held $3.8 million of our 11.75% senior 
subordinated notes, all of which will be repaid with the net proceeds of this 
offering. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the indebtedness being repaid, 
our affiliates that hold such indebtedness would be entitled to receive accrued 
interest and prepayment premiums in respect of such indebtedness. As such, 
assuming that our affiliates neither increase nor decrease their holdings of the 
indebtedness to be repaid, we estimate that they would receive $4.0 million in 
the aggregate upon completion of this offering and repayment of such 
indebtedness, excluding any accrued interest that will be paid at the date of 
redemption. Additionally, affiliates of certain of the underwriters are or may 
become holders of the 11.75% senior subordinated notes outstanding and, as a 
result, will receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering when such 
senior subordinated notes are repaid."

follows: 
   
. to repay $10.8 million of outstanding borrowings, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest, under our senior revolving credit facility;  
   
. to repay all $25.8 million outstanding as of December 31, 2011, plus accrued

certain of our existing owners; and  
   
. $1.1 million to make one-time payments to certain of our existing owners 
in the aggregate in consideration for the termination of our advisory and 
consulting agreements with them in accordance with their terms upon 
consummation of this offering.
  
Any additional net proceeds will be applied to repay additional outstanding 
borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility. 
  
As of December 31, 2011, we had $25.8 million aggregate principal amount of 
mezzanine debt outstanding, which following our January 2012 amendment matures 
on March 31, 2015 and accrues interest at a rate of 15.25% per annum. The 
mezzanine debt was refinanced in August 2010, with the proceeds used to 
retire our previously existing mezzanine debt. As of December 31, 2011, we 
had $206.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under our senior 
revolving credit facility, which following our January 2012 amendment matures 
on January 18, 2015. Borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility

Contracts, Cleared Swaps and Other Commodity Interests, short-term Treasury

Futures Contracts and certain Other Commodity Interests that are 
exchange-traded, the Underlying Fund will be required to deposit with the 
futures commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value 
of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the 
obligation under the Commodity Interests at maturity. This deposit is known 
as initial margin. Counterparties in transactions in Cleared Swaps and 
over-the-counter Commodity Interests will generally impose similar collateral 
requirements on the Underlying Funds. The Sponsor will invest the Underlying

respect to over-the-counter Commodity Interests are negotiated by the parties,
and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying
commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure 
under the Commodity Interest, and each party’s creditworthiness. In light of

over-the-counter Commodity Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing 
margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion
of the Underlying Funds’ assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any

ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income received by 
an Underlying Fund will be used for such Underlying Fund’s benefit. 

A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity

between 5% and 10% of the notional amount of a Commodity Interest as initial 
margin when entering into such Commodity Interest. Ongoing margin and 
collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and 
over-the-counter Commodity Interests based on changes in the value of the 
Commodity Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with 
respect to over-the-counter Commodity Interests are negotiated by the parties,
and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying
commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure 
under the Commodity Interest, and each party’s creditworthiness. In light of 
the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and 
over-the-counter Commodity Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing 
margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion
of the Underlying Funds’ assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any
given time. The Treasury Securities, cash and cash equivalents held by the 
Underlying Fund will constitute reserves that will be available to meet 
ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income received by 
an Underlying Fund will be used for such Underlying Fund’s benefit. 

A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Underlying Funds to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is 
merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential 
for any positions held. 

The Fund’s and Underlying Funds’ assets will be held in segregation pursuant 
to the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations."

exchange-traded, the Underlying Fund will be required to deposit with the 
futures commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value 
of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the 
obligation under the Commodity Interests at maturity. This deposit is known 
as initial margin. Counterparties in transactions in Cleared Swaps and

of common stock that we are selling in this offering of approximately $71.7 
million, based on the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot 
specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds of this 
offering. We expect to use a portion of the proceeds of the offering to repay 
in full outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. Aggregate borrowings 
under the facility were $8.3 million as of December 31, 2011, of which $3.8 
million bore interest at a rate of 4.75% per annum and $4.5 million bore 
interest at a rate of 4.25% per annum. We expect to use the balance of the net 
proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary 
businesses, technologies or assets. However, we have no present understandings,
commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or make any 
investments. 

Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds 
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our 
management regarding the application of these net proceeds. Pending the uses 
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United 
States government. The goal with respect to the investment of these net 
proceeds will be capital preservation and liquidity so that these funds are

approximately US$61.9 million, or approximately US$71.9 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and US$4.6 million in 
estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by 
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan 
to use net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

   •   approximately US$50.0 million to fund capital expenditures for expanding
       our fulfillment capabilities; 
 
   •   approximately US$3.0 million to fund capital expenditures for further 
       enhancing our IT systems; and 

   •   the balance for general corporate purposes, including funding working 
       capital and potential investments in and acquisitions of complementary 
       businesses, although we are not currently negotiating any such 
       transactions. 
 
The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. 
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus. To the extent that a certain 
portion or all of the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not 
immediately applied for the above purposes, we plan to invest the net proceeds 
in short-term interest-bearing debt instruments or bank deposits. 

In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we are 
permitted under the PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our PRC 
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our PRC 
consolidated affiliated entity only through loans, subject to satisfaction of 
applicable government registration and approval requirements. Capital 
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries must be approved by the PRC Ministry of 
Commerce or its local counterpart and then registered with the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce, or SAIC, or its local counterpart. 
The PRC Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart is generally required to 
process the relevant approvals or deny our applications within 90 working days 
and SAIC or its local counterpart is required to process the relevant 
registrations or deny our applications within 15 working days. Loans extended 
by us to Vipshop China cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered 
with SAFE or its local branch. The SAFE or its local branch is required to 
process the relevant registrations or deny our applications within 20 working 
days. The actual time taken, however, may be longer due to administrative 
delays. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government 
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. If we fail to satisfy 
these requirements on a timely basis, our ability to remit the funds received 
from this offering to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected,
which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand 
our business."

We intend to contribute all of the net proceeds to Vantiv Holding in exchange

$463.3 million principal amount of our existing senior secured credit 
facilities. Our senior secured credit facilities consist of two first lien

average interest rate under our senior secured credit facilities as of 
December 31, 2011 was 4.6%, before the effect of our interest rate swap. 

Certain of the underwriters of this offering or their affiliates are lenders
under our senior secured credit facilities. Accordingly, certain of the 
underwriters will receive net proceeds from this offering in connection 
with the repayment of our senior secured credit facilities.

Should the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares, 
we will purchase up to 2,086,064 Class B units from the Fifth Third investors

be provided by us, being 2,086,064 shares of Class A common stock at a

case, an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock will be 
cancelled, and these Class B units will convert into Class A units upon such 
purchase. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the 
selling stockholders."

We intend to use $6.5 million of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the 
balance of the acquisition price for the remaining 75% equity interest in our 
U.S. distributor, Caesarstone USA, in which we acquired a 25% interest in 
January 2007. We acquired the remaining interest in May 2011 and the balance 
of the purchase price is payable following the closing of this offering. 

We may use a portion of the net proceeds to expand our production capacity 
during the next one to two years. We estimate that an additional production 
line would require an investment of approximately $30 million. We may choose 
to expand our production capacity by several means, including an acquisition,

capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also use all or a portion 
of the remaining net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary companies, 
products or technologies. We are not currently a party to, or involved with, 
discussions regarding any other material acquisition that is probable, 
although we routinely engage in discussions with distributors and suppliers 
regarding potential acquisitions.

(1)   Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their

(2)   In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been prepaid from 
      the proceeds of an aggregate of $176,760 loan from our Chairman, Julio 
      Gutierrez, as described in this prospectus. The loan will be repaid 
      without interest upon the closing of this offering out of the amount of 
      offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
      expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that such 
      amount is not enough to repay the loan, the loans may be converted, at 
      the option Mr. Gutierrez, into an equivalent amount of warrants on the 
      same terms as the investor warrants and the underwriter warrants. In the 
      event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any 
      such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.  

(3)   The underwriting discount of 3.0% is payable at the closing of the 
      offering and the deferred corporate finance fee of 2.0% is payable upon 
      consummation of our initial business combination and will be held in the 
      trust account until consummation of such business combination.  

(4)   Our chairman, Julio Gutierrez, has agreed to loan us up to an aggregate 
      of $500,000 (or a higher amount at his discretion) to fund our working 
      capital needs following the consummation of this offering and before our 
      initial business combination. In the event that our initial business 
      combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds
      held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
      proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. In the 
      event our initial business combination is consummated, Mr. Gutierrez, at 
      his option, may convert the loans into warrants of the target company at 
      $0.75 per warrant. In accordance with the foregoing, we will enter into 
      an agreement setting forth the terms of the loans with Mr. Gutierrez.  

A total of $40,600,000 ($46,420,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option 
is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of 
the investor warrants and the underwriter warrants described in this 
prospectus, including $800,000 ($920,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
option is exercised in full) deferred corporate finance fee, will be placed in 
a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as 
trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a 
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain 
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and that invest 
solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for the interest income that may be released 
to us to pay any taxes and to fund our working capital requirements, as 
discussed below, and any amounts necessary to purchase up to 15% of our public 
shares if we are no longer an FPI and seek shareholder approval of our business
combination as will be permitted under our memorandum and articles of 
association and the investment management trust agreement to be entered into 
between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, none of the funds 
held in trust will be released from the trust account until the earlier of: 
(i) the consummation of our initial business combination within 15 months from 
the closing of this offering (or 18 months from the closing of this offering 
if we have entered into a definitive agreement with a target business within 
such 15 month period) and (ii) a redemption to public shareholders prior to any
voluntary winding-up in the event we do not consummate our initial business 
combination within the applicable period. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial 
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our 
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account 
that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, 
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income that 
may be released to fund our working capital requirements in addition to the 
loans discussed below will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which
such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may
begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an 
indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, 
depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only 
after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary 
agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business combination. 
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount 
necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to use from the trust 
account is less than $115,000 as a result of the current interest rate 
environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, 
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, Mr.
Gutierrez has agreed to loan us up to an aggregate of $500,000 (or a higher 
amount at his discretion) to fund our working capital needs following the 
consummation of this offering and before our initial business combination. In 
the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a 
portion of the offering proceeds held outside the trust account to repay such 
loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such 
repayment, other than the interest on such proceeds that may be released to us 
for working capital purposes. 

In the event our initial business combination is consummated, Mr. Gutierrez, at
his option, may convert the loans into warrants of the target company at $0.75 
per warrant. 

As of the date of this prospectus, Julio Gutierrez has loaned and advanced to 
us a total of $176,760 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this 
offering. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of September 30, 2012 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the amount of offering proceeds
that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. 

Unlike many blank check companies, if we are no longer an FPI and seek 
shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct 
redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender 
offer rules prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, our 
memorandum and articles of association and the investment management trust 
agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust 
Company will permit the release to us from the trust account of amounts 
necessary to purchase up to 15% of the public shares (600,000 shares, or 
690,000 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
at any time commencing after the filing of a preliminary proxy statement for 
our initial business combination and ending on the record date for the vote to 
be held to approve our initial business combination. Purchases will be made 
only in open market transactions at times when we are not in possession of any 
material non-public information and may not be made during a restricted period 
under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Due to the relatively sporadic 
public trading of securities of similarly structured blank check companies, it 
is unlikely that we would be able to make such purchases under Rule 10b-18 
under the Exchange Act and still accomplish the intended goals of such 
purchases as described below. Therefore, we do not intend to comply with Rule 
10b-18 and may make purchases outside of the requirements of Rule 10b-18 as we 
see fit. This could result in our liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)
(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We can purchase any or all of the 
600,000 shares (or 690,000 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option 
is exercised in full) we are entitled to purchase. It will be entirely in our 
discretion as to how many shares are purchased. Purchasing decisions will be 
made based on various factors, including the then current market price of our 
ordinary shares and the terms of the proposed business combination. All shares 
purchased by us will be immediately cancelled. Such open market purchases, if 
any, would be conducted by us to minimize any disparity between the then 
current market price of our ordinary shares and the per-share amount held in 
the trust account. A market price below the per-share trust amount could 
provide an incentive for purchasers to buy our shares after the filing of our 
preliminary proxy statement at a discount to the per-share amount held in the 
trust account for the sole purpose of voting against our initial business 
combination and exercising redemption rights for the full per-share amount held
in the trust account. Such trading activity could enable such investors to 
block our initial business combination by making it more difficult for us to 
obtain the approval of such business combination by the vote of a majority of 
our outstanding ordinary shares that are entitled to vote and are voted. 

If we are no longer an FPI and seek shareholder approval of our initial 
business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our 
business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, we may enter into 
privately negotiated transactions to purchase public shares from shareholders 
following our consummation of our initial business combination with proceeds 
released to us from the trust account immediately following consummation of our
initial business combination. Our initial shareholder, directors, officers, 
advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial 
business combination. Neither we nor our directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates will make any such purchases when we or they are in possession of 
any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or during a 
restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Although we do not
currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price (over the trust value) 
for such public shares, in the event we do, the payment of a premium may not be
in the best interest of those shareholders not receiving any such premium. In 
addition, the payment of a premium by us after the consummation of our initial 
business combination may not be in the best interest of the remaining 
shareholders who do not redeem their shares. Such shareholders may experience a
reduction in book value per share compared to the value received by 
shareholders that have their shares purchased by us at a premium. Nevertheless,
because any payment of a premium by us will be made only from proceeds released
to us from the trust account following completion of a business combination, no
such payments will reduce the per share amounts available in the trust account 
for redemption in connection with the business combination. Except for the 
limitations described above on use of trust proceeds released to us prior to 
consummating our initial business combination, there is no limit on the amount 
of shares that could be acquired by us or our affiliates, or the price we or 
they may pay, if we hold a shareholder vote. 

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our 
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption 
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial 
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an 
alternate business combination. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such 
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described 
herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to 
consummate our initial business combination within 15 months following the 
closing of this offering (or 18 months from the closing of this offering if we 
have entered into a definitive agreement with a target business for our initial
business combination within 15 months from the consummation of this offering 
and such business combination has not yet been consummated within such 15 month
period), subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any 
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the 
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a 
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust 
account. 

Our initial shareholder has agreed to waive his redemption rights with respect 
to any founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of 
our initial business combination. Our officers and directors have also agreed 
to waive their redemption rights with respect to any public shares purchased 
during or after the offering in connection with the consummation of our initial
business combination. In addition, our initial shareholder has agreed to waive 
his right to liquidating distributions with respect to the founder shares if we
fail to consummate our initial business combination within 15 months from the 
closing of this offering or 18 months from the closing of this offering if we 
have entered into a definitive agreement with a target business for our initial
business combination within 15 months from the consummation of this offering 
and such business combination has not yet been consummated within such 15 month
period. However, if our initial shareholder, or any of our officers, directors 
or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be 
entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public 
shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the 
required time period."

 (1)  A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee,
 the FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq Capital
 Markets listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees have been paid 
 from the funds we received from A. Lorne Weil described below. These funds
 will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.  

 (2)  No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of
 the insider warrants or the second unit purchase option.  

 (3)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at
 $500,000. In addition, interest income earned on the amount held in the
 trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) will be
 available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. We estimate the
 interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $250,000 in total
 for a 21-month period, assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.25% per 
 year. However, if interest rates are less than 0.25% per year, the amount of
 interest we will have access to will be reduced.  

 (4)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
 these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we
 may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
 connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
 based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
 anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
 fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
 fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
 category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.  

Certain of the initial shareholders (or their affiliates) and Graubard Miller,
our counsel, have committed to purchase the insider warrants from us on 
a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this 
offering for an aggregate purchase price of $2,400,000. In addition, 
EarlyBirdCapital and/or its designees will purchase the second purchase 
option in a private placement simultaneously with the consummation of this 
offering for $500,000. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases 
will be placed in the trust account described below. 

$40,800,000, or $46,620,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, including the $2,900,000 we will receive 
from the sale of the insider warrants and second purchase option will be 
placed in a trust account at UBS Financial Services Inc., maintained by 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. 
The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States treasuries 
having a maturity of 180 days or less so that we are not deemed to be an 
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to 
(i) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be 
released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations and (ii) interest 
earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us for 
our working capital requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the 
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination 
or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as 
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete 
a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers 
of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target 
business. 

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar 
fees) will be paid to any of our officers, directors, initial shareholders, 
or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in 
order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection 
with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target 
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses 
and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, 
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their 
operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the 
funds not held in trust and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and 
other third-party expenses attendant to the search for target businesses and 
to the due diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation of a business 
combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses by our officers,
directors and initial shareholders” and “Working capital to cover 
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation
obligations and reserves.” Since the role of present management after 
a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination. 

The net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our 
working capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be 
approximately $500,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for 
a business combination. We intend to use the after-tax interest earned for 
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with 
our search for a target business and for director and officer liability 
insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due 
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of 
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and 
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. 

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust 
account, along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the 
trust account, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these 
funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may 
reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories. 

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, 
including some of the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target 
business and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including a fee equal to 
$1,610,000 to EarlyBirdCapital upon consummation of the business combination 
for acting as our investment banker on a non-exclusive basis to assist us in 
structuring and negotiating a business combination (but not for purposes of 
identifying a target business). To the extent that our share capital is used 
in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the 
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate 
a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will,
along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital 
to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds 
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the 
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, 
research and development of existing or new products. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will 
pay the costs of liquidating from our remaining assets outside of the trust 
account. If such funds are insufficient, A. Lorne Weil has agreed to advance 
us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to 
be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such 
expenses. 

As of the date of this prospectus, A. Lorne Weil has advanced to us an 
aggregate of $100,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this 
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA 
filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq Capital Markets listing 
fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan is 
payable without interest on the earlier of (i) November 8, 2012, (ii) the 
consummation of this offering or (iii) the date on which we determine not 
to proceed with our initial public offering. The loan will be repaid out of t
he proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient 
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the 
trust account) to operate for the next 21 months, assuming that a business 
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in 
order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this 
offering, our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates 
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any 
time, in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory 
note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s discretion, up to $500,000 
of the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant. 
The warrants would be identical to the insider warrants. If we do not 
complete a business combination, the loans will be forgiven. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our 
liquidation or (ii) if that public shareholder elects to convert shares in 
connection with a shareholder vote or sells such shares to us in a tender 
offer. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or 
interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

stock offered by us of approximately $96.2 million, based upon the initial
public offering price of $15.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If 
the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of Class A common 
stock is exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds of 
approximately $111.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive
any proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock by the selling stockholder. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization 
and financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and 
create a public market for our Class A common stock. As of the date of this 
prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for 
the net proceeds to us from this offering. However, we currently intend to 
use the net proceeds to us from this offering primarily for general corporate
purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing activities, general 
and administrative matters and capital expenditures. We may also use 
a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,
technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business, although 
we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions 
or investments. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net 
proceeds from this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net
proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing 
securities such as money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial 
paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

offering expenses payable by us, based on the initial public offering price of 
US$6.00 per ADS. 

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering primarily for 
the following purposes: 

• approximately US$15.4 million to conduct acquisitions and increase its 
  working capital; and 

• approximately US$9.0 million to maintain its existing ownership interests in 
  current joint ventures. 

Depending on future events and other changes in the business climate, we may 
determine at a later time to use the net proceeds for different purposes. 
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds to us in short-term 
bank deposits, direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government or other
short-term money market instruments. These investments may have a material 
adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment 
in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a PFIC for U.S. federal tax 
purposes, which could result in negative tax consequences for you. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling 
shareholders."

We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this offering to purchase 
newly-issued membership units in our consolidated subsidiary, EDG LLC, 
which will be used by EDG LLC to repay certain indebtedness of its 
consolidated subsidiaries. Specifically, we expect to repay the following 
indebtedness: 

• B&L term loan . We intend to repay all amounts outstanding under the BL 
term loan, including accrued interest and a prepayment penalty, which would 
amount to a payment of $114.4 million as of the date of this prospectus 
($131.3 million at December 31, 2011). The BL term loan matures on August 
19, 2015 and is prepayable at any time, subject to the payment of a 
make-whole prepayment penalty. At the date of this prospectus, $104.5 
million was outstanding under the BL term loan ($116.4 million at December 
31, 2011), there was accrued interest of $1.0 million ($0.4 million at 
December 31, 2011) and the prepayment penalty was $8.9 million ($14.5 million 
at December 31, 2011). The weighted average interest rate paid during the year 
ended December 31, 2011 was 11.0%. 

• Seller Note . We intend to repay $10.0 million of the amount outstanding 
under the Seller Note, which includes accrued interest of $1.2 million. The 
Seller Note bears interest at a compounding rate of 8.0% per annum and matures 
on August 19, 2019. At the date of this prospectus, $50.0 million of principal 
was outstanding ($50.0 million at December 31, 2011) and $6.3 million of 
accrued interest was outstanding ($5.3 million at December 31, 2011). 

• EM revolving credit facility. We intend to use all of the remaining net 
proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under the EM revolving credit facility, 
which would amount to a payment of $26.0 at the date of this prospectus ($9.1 
million at December 31, 2011). At the date of this prospectus, $61.9 million
was outstanding under the EM revolving credit facility ($20.5 million at 
December 31, 2011). The EM revolving credit facility matures on May 11, 2014 
and the weighted average interest rate paid during the year ended December 31, 
2011 was 4.36%. 

Jefferies Finance LLC, an affiliate of Jefferies & Company, Inc., serves as 
the lead arranger and the administrative agent and has been a lender under 
the BL term loan. In light of this relationship, this offering will

this offering will be approximately $139.4 million, after deducting estimated 
offering expenses of approximately $3.1 million (or, if the underwriters 
exercise their overallotment option in full, approximately $160.8 million, 
after deducting the estimated offering expenses of approximately $3.1 million).
Our Manager will pay directly to the underwriters an underwriting discount of 
$5.3 million (or, if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in 
full, $6.2 million). No underwriting discount will be paid on the 500,000 
shares purchased by Ares Investments. 

We intend to use approximately $47.3 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering to repay outstanding amounts under the Wells Fargo Facility and the 
Citibank Facility. 

As of March 31, 2012 we had approximately $43.8 million outstanding under the 
Wells Fargo Facility. This amount was used to finance the acquisition of 
certain of the senior commercial mortgage loans comprising the Initial 
Portfolio. As of the date of this prospectus, the interest charged on this 
indebtedness is 2.85%. The initial maturity date of the Wells Fargo Facility 
is December 14, 2014 and, provided that certain conditions are met and 
applicable extension fees are paid, is subject to two 12-month extension 
options. 

As of March 31, 2012 we had approximately $3.5 million outstanding under the 
Citibank Facility. This amount was used to finance the acquisition of certain 
of the senior commercial mortgage loans comprising the Initial Portfolio. As 
of the date of this prospectus, the interest charged on this indebtedness is 
4.5%. The initial maturity date of the Citibank Facility is December 8, 2012. 
If the gross proceeds of this offering are at least $200 million, then upon 
the completion of this offering the maturity date will be automatically 
extended to December 8, 2013, and may be further extended on December 8, 2013 
for an additional 12 months upon the payment of the applicable extension fee 
and provided that no event of default is then occurring. 

We intend to use approximately $6.3 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock. 

We intend to use any net proceeds of this offering that are not applied as 
described above for general corporate working capital purposes, including 
originating our target investments. Until appropriate investments can be 
identified, our Manager may invest this balance in interest-bearing short-term 
investments, including money market accounts or funds, CMBS or corporate bonds,
which are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. These initial 
investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to 
achieve from our target investments. 

Affiliates of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are
lenders under the Wells Fargo Facility and the Citibank Facility, respectively.
Depending on the amount of indebtedness borrowed under the Wells Fargo Facility
and the Citibank Facility and the use of proceeds from this offering to repay 
such amounts, affiliates of certain of the underwriters may receive more than 
5% of the proceeds of this offering."

create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering
for working capital and general corporate purposes, including further expansion
of our sales and marketing efforts, continued investments in research and
development and for capital expenditures. Specifically, we intend to hire
additional personnel to support the growth in our business. In addition, we may
use a portion of the proceeds received by us from this offering for acquisitions
of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. We have no agreements
with respect to any material acquisitions at this time and we have not allocated
specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes. Based on our current
cash and cash equivalents balance together with cash generated from operations,
we do not expect that we will need to utilize any of the net proceeds to us of
this offering to fund our operations during the next 12 months.

We cannot specify with certainty the particular amounts or uses for the net
proceeds to be received by us from this offering. Accordingly, our management
team will have broad discretion in using the net proceeds to be received by us
from this offering.

Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to

proceeds from the sale of 3,000,000 shares of common stock, prior to deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses 
payable by us, will be $12.0 million ($13.8 million if the over-allotment 
option granted to the underwriter is exercised in full). 

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $9.5 million, 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our underwriter’s 
expense allowance, the fees of the qualified independent underwriter, and 
other estimated expenses of approximately $1.2 million, which includes legal, 
accounting, printing costs and various fees associated with the registration 
and listing of our shares. If the underwriter exercises its right to purchase 
an additional 450,000 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, we will 
receive an additional approximate $1.64 million, after deducting approximately 
$0.16 million for underwriting discounts and commissions.  

We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 
approximately $5 million for research and development including capital 
expenditures, $1 million for protection of intellectual property, $1.25 
million for exploration of marketing opportunities, and the balance for 
working capital and general corporate purposes. 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including market conditions, results from our research and 
development efforts, business developments and opportunities and related 
rate of growth, sales and marketing activities and competition. Accordingly, 
our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net 
proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management 
regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering. We may find 
it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering 
for other purposes. Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use 
of proceeds and the alternate purposes for which the proceeds may be used 
include:  

 •  the existence of unforeseen or other opportunities or the need to take 
    advantage of changes in timing of our existing activities;   

 •  the need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase, reduce or eliminate
    one or more existing initiatives due to, among other things, changing 
    market conditions and competitive developments or interim results of 
    research and development efforts;   

 •  results from our business development and marketing efforts, including co-
    development and pilot site installation opportunities that may materialize;

 •  the effect of federal, state, and local regulation, including those 
    governing emissions, of potential customers in our identified industries;  

 •  our ability to attract development funding or to license or sell our 
    technology to industry sponsors or other interested organizations; and/or  

 •  strategic opportunities of which we are not currently aware present 
    themselves (including acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and other 
    similar transactions).   

From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate 
continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of 
resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being optimized."

Our revolving credit facility matures in December 2014 and bears interest 
at a variable rate, which was approximately 3.2% per annum as of December 
31, 2011. Our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
were incurred to fund exploration, development and other capital expenditures. 
While we do not currently have any plans to immediately borrow additional 
amounts under the revolving credit facility, we may at any time reborrow 
amounts repaid under the revolving credit facility and expect to do so to 
fund a portion of our exploration and development program. 

The preferred units issued by Midstates Petroleum Holdings LLC to an 
affiliate of First Reserve bear interest, payable upon redemption, at a 
variable rate, which was approximately 9.5% per annum as of April 18, 2012. 
In addition, a fixed interest charge of 1.5% of the aggregate amount of 
capital contributions made with respect to the preferred units is payable 
upon redemption. Proceeds from the issuance of the preferred units were used 
to fund exploration, development and other capital expenditures. In connection 
with the completion of our corporate reorganization, Midstates Petroleum 
Holdings LLC will no longer exist as a separate entity and therefore no 
additional preferred units will be available for issuance. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common 
stock by the selling stockholders. We will pay all expenses related to this 
offering, other than underwriting discounts and commissions related to the 
shares sold by the selling stockholders. 

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our revolving 
credit facility and, as a result, may receive more than 5% of the net 
proceeds from this offering."

deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering 
payable by us, will be approximately $231 million (or approximately $267 
million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full). 

We intend to use approximately $82 million of the net proceeds received from 
this offering to repay amounts outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving
line of credit. Our senior unsecured revolving line of credit matures on 
February 24, 2015, with a one-year extension option that we may exercise in 
certain circumstances, and bears interest at a variable rate equal to the 
London Interbank Offered Rate or, LIBOR, plus a margin of between 1.75% and 
2.50% per annum or the alternative base rate plus a margin of between 0.75% and
1.50% per annum, both based on our leverage ratio as calculated under the 
credit agreement. The interest rate under the senior unsecured revolving line 
of credit and the unsecured term loan was 2.75% as of March 21, 2012. We used 
the amounts that we borrowed under our senior unsecured revolving line of 
credit to repay other indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.

Affiliates of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Wells Fargo 
Securities, LLC, PNC Capital Markets LLC and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. are 
lenders under our senior unsecured revolving line of credit, and will receive 
their pro rata portion of the $82 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering used to repay amounts outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving
line of credit. Accordingly, more than 5% of the net proceeds of this offering 
are intended to be used to repay amounts owed to affiliates of these 
underwriters. 

We intend to use approximately $95 million of net proceeds received from this 
offering to repay a cross-collateralized pool of mortgages secured by six 
properties as of December 31, 2011, with an interest rate of 7.50%, that 
matures as of June 1, 2017. A premium of approximately $11 million is 
associated with this pool of mortgages and the full amount of the premium would
be amortized upon repayment. 

We intend to use approximately $55 million of net proceeds received from this 
offering to repurchase Inland Equity’s interest in IW JV pursuant to a call 
right contained in IW JV’s organizational documents. On March 20, 2012, 
pursuant to the terms of the call right, we provided a written notice of 
exercise to Inland Equity and agreed to the repurchase price with Inland 
Equity. As a result, following this offering we anticipate that we will own 
100% of IW JV."

that we are offering will be approximately $6.8 billion, or approximately 
$6.9 billion if the underwriters exercise in full their right to purchase 
additional shares to cover over-allotments, based on the initial public 
offering price of $38.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes of our initial public offering are to create a 
public market for our Class A common stock and thereby enable future access 
to the public equity markets by us and our employees, obtain additional 
capital, and facilitate an orderly distribution of shares for the selling 
stockholders. We intend to use the net proceeds to us from our initial 
public offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes; 
however, we do not currently have any specific uses of the net proceeds
planned. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to us to satisfy a 
portion of the anticipated tax withholding and remittance obligations 
related to the initial settlement of our outstanding RSUs. Additionally,
we may use a portion of the proceeds to us for acquisitions of complementary 
businesses, technologies, or other assets. However, we have no commitments to 
use the proceeds from this offering for any such acquisitions or investments 
at this time. 

Pending other uses, we intend to invest the proceeds to us in 
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities such as money market funds, 
certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government, or hold as cash. We cannot predict whether the proceeds 
invested will yield a favorable return. Our management will have broad 
discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive from our 
initial public offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of 
our management regarding the application of the net proceeds. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A common 
stock by the selling stockholders. Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, 
and CEO, will offer and sell 30,200,000 shares in our initial public offering. 
The substantial majority of the net proceeds Mr. Zuckerberg will receive upon 
such sale will be used to satisfy taxes that he will incur in connection with 
the partial exercise of an outstanding stock option."

this offering will be approximately US$87.1 million, after deducting

million of the net proceeds to repay in part our term loans under the First 
Lien Credit Agreement. Our term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement 
bear interest at a floating rate of U.S. Dollar London Interbank Offered Rate
 (""LIBOR"") plus 4.00%. At December 31, 2011, the interest rate applicable to 
our term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement was 5.5%. US$13.7 million
of the term loans mature on May 31, 2014 and US$645.3 million of the term 
loans mature on May 31, 2016. Affiliates of Barclays Capital Inc. and Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc., underwriters for this offering, are term loan lenders 
under our First Lien Credit Agreement and, upon any application of the net 
proceeds from this offering to repay our term loans, will receive their 
proportionate share of the amount being repaid. The borrowings made in the 
past year under the term loans were used to repay our borrowings under 
a second lien credit agreement (the ""Second Lien Credit Agreement"") and the 
Vendor Loan Note. 

The selling shareholders identified in this prospectus have granted the 
underwriters the option to purchase up to 1,875,000 additional ADSs if the 
underwriters sell more than 12,500,000 ADSs in this offering. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of ADSs, if any, by the selling 
shareholders, which include affiliates of CCMP and Unitas, which are entities 
affiliated with certain members of our board of directors."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering together with cash on 
hand: 

• to prepay an aggregate amount of $42.5 million of our existing senior secured
  credit facility; 

• to pay J.H. Whitney a fee in an aggregate amount of $1.0 million in 
  connection with the termination of the management agreement; and 

• for other general corporate purposes. 

In March 2011, we used borrowings under our senior secured credit facility to 
discharge all indebtedness under our prior senior secured credit facility, pay 
a termination fee in connection with our interest rate swap agreement and pay 
a dividend indirectly to J.H. Whitney VI through JCS Holdings, LLC, our parent 
company. As of March 26, 2012, we had $117.0 million of borrowings outstanding 
under our senior secured credit facility, which matures in March 2016. The 
weighted-average interest rate (including margin) under our senior secured 
credit facility was 6.25% at March 26, 2012. KeyBank National Association, an 
affiliate of one of the underwriters, will receive a portion of the proceeds 
from this offering. Accordingly, this offering is being made in compliance with
FINRA Rule 5121. 

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we may 
invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing

$20.00 per share. Assuming no shares are issued pursuant to the underwriters' 
over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1,200,000 shares, this 
offering would result in gross proceeds of $160.0 million to us. Concurrently 
with, and conditional upon the consummation of, this offering, we will also 
issue and sell (i) 2,231,787 units, with each unit consisting of one share 
of our common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.5 share of our common stock, 
to certain institutional accredited investors for $20.00 per unit, and 
(ii) 46,043 shares of our common stock, at a price of $20.00 per share to
our Manager's deferred compensation plan in another private placement. The 
sale of our securities in these two private placements will result in gross 
proceeds of $45.6 million to us. Our Manager has agreed to pay the $0.80 per 
share underwriting discount payable with respect to each share sold in this 
offering and the $0.60 per unit placement agent fee payable with respect to 
each unit sold in the concurrent private placement of units to certain 
institutional accredited investors (other than to investors who have 
pre-existing business relationships with our Manager for which there 
will not be any placement agent fee payable). No placement agent fee or 
underwriting discount will be payable with respect to the shares of common 
stock we will sell to our Manager's deferred compensation plan. We currently 
estimate our expenses attributable to our organization, this offering and the 
two private placements (other than the underwriting discount and the placement 
agent fee payable by our Manager) to be $1.2 million. If the total 
attributable expenses exceed $1.2 million, our Manager has agreed to pay 
us for any expenses that exceed this amount. Therefore, we estimate that 
our aggregate net proceeds from this offering and the two private placements 
will be $204.4 million, after deducting estimated organizational and offering 
expenses payable by us (or $232.0 million, if the underwriters exercise their 
overallotment option in full). 

We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placements to purchase Agency RMBS and our potential target assets, focusing 
predominantly on Agency RMBS. Subject to prevailing market conditions at the 
time of purchase, we currently expect that the capital we deploy will be used 
initially to purchase Agency RMBS and our potential target assets in the 
following ranges: approximately 85-100% Agency RMBS, approximately 0-15% 
non-Agency RMBS, approximately 0-5% CMBS and approximately 0-5% ABS. Until 
appropriate investments can be identified, our Manager may invest the net 
proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements in 
interest-bearing short-term investments, including money market accounts 
and/or funds, that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT 
and maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. These 
initial investments, if any, are expected to provide a lower net return 
than we will seek to achieve from investments in Agency RMBS and our 
potential target assets. We anticipate that we will be able to identify 
a sufficient amount of investments in Agency RMBS and our potential 
target assets within approximately one to two months after the closing 
of this offering and the concurrent private placement. However, depending 
on the availability of appropriate investment opportunities and subject to 
market prevailing conditions, there can be no assurance that we will be 
able to identify a sufficient amount of investments within this timeframe. 

Prior to the time we have fully used the net proceeds of this offering 
and the concurrent private placements to acquire Agency RMBS and our 
potential target assets, we may fund our quarterly distributions out of 
such net proceeds."

discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us, a portion of which

from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock by the selling 
stockholders, which includes one of our officers and directors, including 
any shares sold by the selling stockholders in connection with the exercise 
of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain capital to pay all 
undistributed cumulative earnings to date to the current shareholders of 
World of Jeans & Tops, obtain additional capital, create a public market 
for our common stock and facilitate our future access to the public equity 
markets. Prior to completion of this offering, World of Jeans & Tops will 
issue notes to its then-existing “S” Corporation shareholders, which will 
reflect the amount of undistributed cumulative earnings remaining in World 
of Jeans & Tops from the date of its formation up to the date of termination 
of its “S” Corporation status. The notes have a term of 15 days and their 
interest rate will be the one-month LIBOR rate as of the date of their 
execution. We expect to use $84.0 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering to pay in full the principal amount of the notes, as well as any 
accrued interest. Therefore, our stockholders immediately following this 
offering, who were also the shareholders of World of Jeans & Tops prior to 
termination of its “S” Corporation status, will receive most of the net 
proceeds from the sale of shares offered by us. 

We expect net proceeds in excess of the final “S” Corporation distribution 
to be approximately $23.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discount 
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use such excess 
proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may 
include funding new store openings and funding other operating costs such 
as merchandise inventories, payroll, store rent, marketing and infrastructure 
expenditures. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending 
on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and 
technological developments and the rate of growth of our business. Therefore, 
we do not currently have a specific plan for the excess proceeds from this 
offering and our management will have significant flexibility in applying the 
net proceeds. Pending their use, we intend to invest the excess proceeds from 
this offering in short term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

Intended Use                                                       to Such Use

Repay borrowings outstanding under PCEC’s senior secured credit 
agreement and second lien credit agreement                           $  104.0
Distribution to equity owners of PCEC                                $  234.5

PCEC maintains a $400 million senior secured credit agreement, which provides 
for revolving loans and a $60 million second lien term loan. Borrowings under 
the senior secured credit agreement have a maturity date of August 24, 2012 
and bear interest at the applicable LIBOR rate, plus applicable margins ranging
from 1.50% to 2.25%, or at a base rate, based upon the greatest of (a) the rate
of interest as publicly announced by the administrative agent as its “reference
rate” and (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, plus applicable margins 
ranging from 0.50% to 1.25%. Borrowings under the second lien term loan have a 
maturity date of February 24, 2013 and bear interest at either (a) the greater 
of (i) the applicable LIBOR rate and (ii) 3.25%, plus the applicable margin of 
6.50%, or (b) a base rate, based upon the greater of (i) the rate of interest 
as publicly announced by the administrative agent as its “reference rate” and 
(ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, plus the applicable margin of 5.50%. 

As of December 31, 2011, total borrowings under PCEC’s senior secured credit 
agreement were $74.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 
approximately 2.01% for the fourth quarter of 2011. As of December 31, 2011, 
PCEC had $30.0 million outstanding under its second lien term loan at a 
weighted average interest rate of approximately 8.75% for the fourth quarter 
of 2011. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters participating in this 
offering are lenders under PCEC’s senior secured credit agreement and second 
lien credit agreement and will receive a substantial portion of the proceeds 
from this offering pursuant to the repayment of a portion of the borrowings 
thereunder."

after deducting estimated underwriting discounts, will be approximately $639.1 
million, or $735.0 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase additional common units. 
  
The Carlyle Group L.P. intends to use all of these proceeds to purchase newly 
issued Carlyle Holdings partnership units from Carlyle Holdings. We intend to 
cause Carlyle Holdings to use substantially all of these proceeds to repay the 
remaining outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of our 
existing senior secured credit facility. We intend to cause Carlyle Holdings to
use any proceeds from the exercise by the underwriters of their option to 
purchase additional common units from us to repay indebtedness under a loan 
agreement we entered into in connection with the acquisition of Claren Road and
any remainder for general corporate purposes, including general operational 
needs, growth initiatives, acquisitions and strategic investments and to fund 
capital commitments to, and other investments in and alongside of, our 
investment funds. We anticipate that the acquisitions we may pursue will be 
those that would broaden our platform where we believe we can provide investors
with differentiated products to meet their needs. Carlyle Holdings will also 
bear or reimburse The Carlyle Group L.P. for all of the expenses of this 
offering, which we estimate will be approximately $19.2 million. 
  
Outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $310.9 million 
as of December 31, 2011 and $618.1 million as of May 2, 2012. Our revolving 
credit facility matures on September 30, 2016 and currently bears interest at 
a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) at an alternate base rate plus an 
applicable margin not to exceed 0.75%, or (b) at LIBOR plus an applicable 
margin not to exceed 1.75%. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility have
been used to fund the redemption of the subordinated notes payable to Mubadala,
portions of the consideration and/or related transaction expenses in connection
with our recent acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. 
Affiliates of some of the underwriters are lenders under the revolving credit 
facility and will receive proceeds to the extent their currently outstanding 
loans under that facility are repaid as described above."

in this offering will be $171.7 million after deducting estimated underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Our net proceeds 
will increase by approximately $27.0 million if the underwriters’ option to 
purchase additional shares is exercised in full. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate 
purposes, which may include organic growth or the acquisition of businesses 
or assets that we believe are complementary to our present business and 
provide attractive risk-adjusted returns."
"SUPERNUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/supernus-pharmaceuticals-inc-702676-66013,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/supernus-pharmaceuticals-inc-702676-66013,424B4,5/2/2012,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=8583926,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of common stock that we are 
offering will be approximately $45.5 million, or $52.4 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. This projection is 
based upon the initial public offering price of $5.00 per share and after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions as well as estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds as follows: 

• Approximately $25.7 million for sales and marketing expenses in conjunction 
  with the expected commercial launch of SPN-538 and the preparation for the 
  commercial launch of SPN-804, assuming timely approval by the FDA. 

• Approximately $2.3 million to fund the continued clinical development of 
  SPN-810, including: preclinical carcinogenicity testing; process development 
  for commercial bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient; and completion of 
  current Phase II testing. 

• Approximately $1.3 million to fund the continued clinical development of SPN-
  812, including: preclinical carcinogenicity testing; process development for 
  commercial bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient; continued Phase II testing;
  and formulation development. 

• Approximately $5.8 million to repay a portion of the principle of the term 
  loans under our secured credit facility. 

• The remainder, if any, for general corporate purposes including general and 
  administrative expenses, capital expenditures and working capital. 

We believe that net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to complete 
the development of SPN-538 and SPN-804 through FDA approval and to fund the 
expected commercial launch of SPN-538 and preparation for the commercial launch
of SPN-804, assuming FDA approval on their respective PDUFA dates. In addition,
our operating plan, including our planned commercialization of SPN-538 and SPN-
804, may change as a result of many factors. 

As of December 31, 2011, we had $30.0 million of term loans outstanding under 
our secured credit facility, of which $15.0 million mature in August 2014 and 
$15.0 million mature in January 2015. The term loans bear interest at a fixed 
rate per annum of 11.0%. We used the proceeds of the terms loans to fund 
ongoing clinical trials for SPN-538, SPN-804 and SPN-810, to prepare for 
manufacturing validation of SPN-538 and SPN-804, to support formulation for 
various clinical stage products, to prepare commercial marketing of SPN-538 and
for regulatory filing fees. 

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds as described
above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of funds may be 
necessary. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon 
numerous factors, including the progress of our development and 
commercialization efforts, the progress of our clinical trials, whether or not 
we enter into strategic collaborations or partnerships and our operating costs 
and expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility
in applying these net proceeds. 

The costs and timing of drug development and commercialization and of 
regulatory approval, particularly conducting clinical studies, are highly 
uncertain, are subject to substantial risks and can often change. Accordingly, 
we may change the allocation of use of these proceeds as a result of 
contingencies such as the progress of research, progress of clinical trials, 
ability to secure approval of our products from the FDA, uptake of our products
in the marketplace and competitive responses. 

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering as described above or otherwise,
we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade securities."

common stock, obtain additional capital, facilitate our future access to the 
public equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential 
customers and improve our competitive position. While we have no specific 
plans at this time, we may use some of the proceeds from this offering to make 
additions to and expand our data center operations, and to build out our

offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $43.0 million.
The selling stockholders have granted the underwriters an option, exercisable 
for 30 days after the date of this prospectus, to purchase, from time to time, 
in whole or in part, up to an aggregate of 937,750 shares at the initial public
offering price less estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses. This option may be exercised if the underwriters 
sell more than 6,250,000 shares in connection with this offering. Because all 
of the shares subject to this option will be sold by the selling stockholders, 
we will not receive any additional proceeds from the sale of those shares. 

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of 
$12.00 per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this 
offering by $3.9 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set 
forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after 
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use our net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
working capital. We may also use a portion of the proceeds to repay our 
outstanding term loans or in acquisitions of businesses, products and 
technologies that are complementary to our business. As of April 30, 2012, we 
had outstanding term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $8.5 million 
under a Loan and Security Agreement dated January 28, 2011, which were used to 
finance our working capital requirements. The term loans bear interest at a 
rate of 10.5% per annum. The term loans will mature on August 1, 2015 with 
respect to $5.0 million of the outstanding principal, and on October 1, 2016, 
with respect to the remaining $3.5 million of the outstanding principal. Under 
the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement, we are required to pay a 
prepayment penalty in the form of additional interest payments in the event 
that we prepay any of the outstanding term loans prior to the third anniversary
of the funding of the term loans. Given this requirement, our management has 
not yet determined whether it is in our best interest to repay this 
indebtedness out of the proceeds of this offering. If we had repaid the entire 
amount of the term loans outstanding on April 30, 2012, the aggregate amount of
this prepayment penalty would have been $340,000. Although we have from time to
time evaluated possible acquisitions, we currently have no commitments or 
agreements to make any material acquisition, and we may not make any 
acquisitions in the future. Until we use our net proceeds of the offering, we 
intend to invest the funds in United States government securities and other 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments or high-grade 
corporate notes. Management will have significant flexibility in applying our 
net proceeds of the offering. This offering is also intended to facilitate our 
future access to public markets and to provide a source of liquidity for our 
current investors by establishing a public market for our common stock, as well
as by enabling the sale of our securities by our selling stockholders in this 
offering.

of common stock, calculated using an exchange rate of Ch$499.59=US$1.00 on 
June 21, 2012 assuming that the over-allotment option is not exercised, will 
be approximately Ch$231,650 million (US$464 million). An increase (decrease) 
of $1.00 in the price per share of common stock would increase (decrease) the 
net proceeds in connection with the global offering by Ch$46,477 million 
(US$93 million) (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised and 
calculated using the exchange rate of Ch$499.59=US$1.00 on June 21, 2012). 

We estimate that the net proceeds from the preemptive rights offerings would 
be approximately Ch$358,800 million (US$718 million) (based on the waiver by 
our Controlling Shareholders of their rights with respect to 105,000,000 
shares of common stock subject to the preemptive rights offering and assuming
the exercise in full of the remaining preemptive subscription rights 
calculated using the offering price per share of Ch$2,600). We cannot assure 
you that the preemptive rights offering will be fully or even partially 
subscribed by other shareholders entitled to participate in the preemptive 
rights offering. Consequently, our net proceeds may be limited to the net 
proceeds of the global offering. 

We intend to use (i) approximately U.S.$245 million of the net proceeds from 
the global offering and the preemptive rights offering to repay all of our 
outstanding indebtedness under our Santander Short-Term Loan (as defined 
below), (ii) approximately U.S.$480 million to acquire the remaining 38.636% 
of Jumbo Retail Argentina shares currently held by UBS AG London Branch 
(“UBS London”), (iii) to repay approximately U.S.$200 million in short-term
indebtedness owed to an affiliate of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.
under our BBVA Short-Term Loan (as defined below), (iv) to repay amounts drawn
under our committed credit facility in the aggregate amount of U.S.$750 
million, with an affiliate of, J.P. Morgan and an affiliate of Morgan Stanley,
which amounts drawn totaled U.S.$250 million as of May 7, 2012, and (v) the
remainder, if any, for capital expenditures, working capital and general 
corporate purposes. 

On January 2, 2012, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Prezunic. In 
order to finance our acquisition of Prezunic, on January 2, 2012 we entered 
into a Ch$127.73 billion short-term facility with Banco Santander Chile, as 
lender (“Santander Short-Term Loan”). The Santander Short-Term Loan matures 
on December 28, 2012, and has an annual interest rate equal to the Tasa 
Bancaria (the Banking Interest Rate, or “TAB”), established by the Asociación 
de Bancos e Instituciones Financieras (the Association of Banks and Financial 
Institutions, or “ABIF”), plus 0.4%. 

On March 13, 2012, we entered into a short-term credit facility for Ch$100,000
million (approximately U.S.$200 million) with an affiliate of Banco Bilbao 
Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., as lender, to finance our investing activities, 
including capital expenditures of U.S.$75 million and working capital needs 
of U.S.$25 million, and also to refinance certain short-term liabilities 
amounting to U.S.$100 million, including repayment of overdraft lines (“BBVA 
Short-Term Loan”). The BBVA Short-Term Loan bears interest at an annual rate 
based on the Índice de Cámara Promedio, an indexed interest rate established 
by ABIF, and has a maturity date of March 13, 2013. 

On April 27, 2012, we entered into a U.S.$750 million committed credit 
facility with J.P. Morgan Chase National Association, an affiliate of J.P. 
Morgan, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley, The Bank o
f Tokyo—Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., as lenders, (the 
“J.P. Morgan Credit Facility”) in order to finance our short-term funding 
requirements, including capital expenditures, interest expense and tax 
obligations. The J.P. Morgan Credit Facility bears an interest rate of LIBOR, 
as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, 
plus a margin of 1.25% for the first six months, 1.50% for the following
three months, and 1.75% thereafter. The J.P. Morgan Credit Facility matures 
on March 13, 2013. 

In the event that substantially less than the maximum amount of proceeds from 
the preemptive rights offering are obtained, the Company will apply the funds
received from the global offering to pay amounts outstanding under the 
Santander Short-Term Loan, first, with any remaining proceeds to be applied 
pro rata to repay amounts outstanding under the J.P. Morgan Credit Facility 
and the BBVA Short-Term Loan. Any proceeds then remaining will be applied to 
acquire the Jumbo Retail Argentina shares currently held by UBS London, 
with the remainder, if any, to be used for general corporate purposes. The 
Company plans to fund any shortfall in the amounts of proceeds expected from 
the preemptive rights offering with additional indebtedness. 

It is likely that our capital expenditures will vary significantly from our 
current projections based on timing of investments and changes in market 
opportunities."
STREAM EXCHANGE TRADED TRUST,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/stream-exchange-traded-trust-840573-65551,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/stream-exchange-traded-trust-840573-65551,424B3,6/6/2012,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=8660008,"A substantial amount of proceeds of the offering of the Shares are used by the 
Fund to engage in the trading of Designated Contracts on the Index Commodities 
with a view to tracking the changes, positive or negative, in the levels of the
Index over time, less the expenses of the operations of the Fund. If and when 
necessary, the Fund may invest in one or more Cleared Swaps, Substitute 
Contracts and/or Alternative Financial Instruments. The Fund’s holdings may 
also include Cash Instruments. 

To the extent, if any, that the Fund trades in futures contracts and/or Cleared
Swaps on U.S. exchanges, the assets deposited by the Fund with PBI as margin 
must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. 

To the extent, if any, that the Fund trades in Cleared Swaps on U.S. exchanges,
the assets deposited by the Fund with the futures commission merchant as margin
must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such segregated 
funds may be invested only in a limited range of instruments — principally U.S.
government obligations. 

To the extent, if any, that the Fund trades in futures on markets other than 
regulated U.S. futures exchanges, funds deposited with CFL to margin positions 
held on such exchanges are invested in bank deposits or in instruments of a 
credit standing generally comparable to those authorized by the CFTC for 
investment of “customer segregated funds,” although applicable CFTC rules 
prohibit funds employed in trading on foreign exchanges from being deposited in
“customer segregated fund accounts.” Furthermore, CFL is a member of the 
Financial Services Authority and as such is regulated by the Financial Services
Authority in the conduct of its business in the United Kingdom. 

Although the percentages set forth below may vary substantially over time, as 
of the date of this Prospectus, the Fund estimates: 

(i)  up to approximately 10% of the Net Asset Value of the Fund will be placed 
     in segregated accounts in the name of the Fund with PBI and CFL (or 
     another eligible financial institution, as applicable) in the form of Cash
     Instruments to margin positions of all commodities combined. Such funds 
     will be segregated pursuant to CFTC rules with respect to PBI and will be 
     held pursuant to the rules of the Financial Services Authority with 
     respect to CFL; and 

(ii) approximately 90% of the Net Asset Value of the Fund will be maintained in
     segregated accounts in the name of the Fund in bank deposits and Cash 
     Instruments. 

The percentage that the Fund’s Cash Instruments will bear to the total net 
assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the futures 
contracts change. 

Should the Fund invest in Cleared Swaps and/or Alternative Financial 
Instruments, the Fund will deposit collateral with the appropriate 
counterparties in order to initiate and maintain positions in Cleared Swaps 
and/or Alternative Financial Instruments, as applicable. Such collateral 
provided will be held in U.S. government securities or in cash, for which the 
Fund will receive interest credits at short-term rates. Certain counterparties 
may receive a benefit as a result of the deposit of such cash in the form of a 
reduction in their outstanding overnight borrowing, despite such cash belonging
to the Fund, not the specific counterparty. 

A futures commission merchant, counterparty, government agency or commodity 
exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the 
Fund to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a 
security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any 
positions held. 

The Managing Owner is a registered commodity pool operator and will be 
responsible for the cash management activities of the Fund, including investing
in Cash Instruments. 

The Fund receives 100% of the interest income earned, if any, on its fixed 
income assets on deposit with the Commodity Brokers or the Custodian."
