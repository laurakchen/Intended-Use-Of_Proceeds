Common Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately
$23.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated Offering expenses, and, together with $675,000 from the exercise of
the Weis Markets Warrant, result in total proceeds of $24.5 million. The Company
intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to repay certain borrowings under
its credit facilities which incur interest at rates between LIBOR plus 1.0% and
LIBOR plus 1.7%. At January 19, 1998 the Company had approximately $15.2 million
of such borrowings outstanding, $6.0 million of which is due in November 2002,
$3.0 million of which begins to amortize in February 1999, $6.0 million of which
is due in February 1998 and $200,000 of which is due upon demand. Approximately
$5.9 million of such borrowings arose from the acquisition of Castle Rock and
the repayment of associated liabilities, approximately $6.2 million of such
borrowings arose from capital expenditures associated with the expansion of the
Milesburg Facility and the construction of the Ginnie Springs bottling facility
and approximately $3.1 million of such borrowings arose from general operating
expenses. The Company intends to use an aggregate of $13.0 million of the
proceeds to fund a portion of the capital expenditures associated with the
expansion of the Milesburg Facility (including repayment of $4.1 million
currently borrowed under the credit facilities as described above) and $4.3
million of the proceeds to fund a portion of the capital expenditures associated
with the construction of the Ginnie Springs bottling facility (including
repayment of $2.1 million currently borrowed under the credit facilities as
described above). The Company estimates that the total cost of the capital
expenditures associated with the expansion of the Milesburg Facility will be
approximately $17.8 million and the construction of the Ginnie Springs bottling
facility will be approximately $6.6 million. The amount of net proceeds to be
used for each project, however, depends on the closing date of the Offering and
the portion of each of the projects remaining to be completed at that date. The
additional amounts that may be required to complete each project will come from
borrowings under the Company's existing credit facilities and cash generated
from the Company's operations. The balance, if any, of the net proceeds from the
Offering will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
Pending such uses, the total proceeds will be invested in short-term,
interest-bearing investment grade securities or commercial paper."

Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be $18,780,000 after 
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses. The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds of the 
Offering to fund construction of an additional 91,000 square feet of office 
space on vacant land adjacent to its headquarters. The Company used internally 
generated funds to acquire this parcel in November 1997. The Company 
anticipates that construction and development of the additional office space 
will cost approximately $9.0 million, that it will break ground in April 1998 
and that it will complete construction in approximately 12 months after 
construction begins. Once the new office space is completed, the Company plans 
to transfer the building and the underlying real estate to an unaffiliated 
third party pursuant to a sale and leaseback transaction. No assurance can be 
made that the cost of construction and development will not exceed such 
estimate, or that the Company will be able to consummate a sale and leaseback 
transaction with respect to such property. Mercury intends to use the balance 
of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. A 
portion of the proceeds of the Offering may be used to pay amounts arising out 
of an audit by the IRS of the Company's tax returns for the years ended June 
30, 1992 through June 30, 1995. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Overview."" In addition, the 
Company may use a portion of the net proceeds of this Offering for acquisitions 
of complementary businesses, technologies or products, although there are 
currently no commitments or agreements with respect to any material 
acquisition. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds 
in short term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities. The Company will 
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock by the Selling

the public equity markets. 

The Company intends to use approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds of 
this offering to fund its capital expenditures for 1998 and to utilize the

Stock offered by the Company hereby, after deducting Underwriting Discounts and 
Commissions and other Offering expenses (estimated to be approximately 
$634,000), all of which are payable by the Company, are estimated to be 
approximately $22.8 million. The net proceeds will be used to repay 
approximately $7.7 million of existing indebtedness and for general corporate 
purposes, which may include future acquisitions of complementary businesses. 
Approximately $15.1 million, or 66% of the net proceeds to be received by the 
Company, will be allocated to general corporate purposes. Accordingly, 
management will have broad discretion with respect to the expenditure of such 
proceeds. See ""Risk Factors -- Broad Management Discretion as to Use of 
Proceeds."" The Company, has no agreement, understanding or commitment with 
respect to any acquisition and is not currently engaged in such negotiations. 

The Company's current indebtedness consists of (i) a revolving line of credit 
and a term loan with a bank with maximum principal amounts of $4.0 million each 
(the ""Bank Facility""), and (ii) a note payable to NationsBank in the original 
principal amount of $560,000 (the ""NationsBank Note""). The interest rate on the 
revolving line of credit agreement is the daily prime rate and the interest 
rate on the term loan is 2.50% in excess of the London InterBank Offered Rate. 
In January 1997, the Company repurchased 13.4% of its outstanding Common Stock 
for $5.9 million, using the proceeds from borrowings on the Bank Facility. The 
Company has also used the revolving line of credit for cash flow requirements 
and general corporate purposes, including the payment of dividends to 
shareholders. See ""Dividend Policy."" As of December 31, 1997, the revolving 
line of credit had an outstanding principal balance of $3.7 million and the 
term loan had an outstanding principal balance of $3.5 million. The NationsBank 
Note bears interest at an annual rate of 10.74% and, as of December 31, 1997, 
had an outstanding principal balance of $517,000. Upon the consummation of the 
Offering, the Company intends to pay off the outstanding balances of the Bank 
Facility and the NationsBank Note in connection with their termination. The 
Company is currently negotiating with lenders regarding a new credit facility. 

The principal purposes of this Offering are to increase the Company's equity 
capital and financial flexibility, create a public market for the Common Stock, 
facilitate future access by the Company to the public equity markets, create a 
currency for potential acquisitions, enhance the Company's ability to use the 
Common Stock as a means of attracting, retaining and incentivizing senior 
managers and professionals and provide working capital to fund the Company's 
growth strategy. See ""Business -- Growth Strategy."" 

Pending their application by the Company, the net proceeds of this Offering not 
immediately required for the purposes described above will be invested 
principally in U.S. Government securities, short-term certificates of deposit, 
money market funds or other short-term, interest-bearing securities."

The Sirrom Note was issued on June 30, 1997. The Sirrom Note requires payments 
of interest only, computed at 13.5% per annum, payable monthly in arrears 
through maturity (June 30, 2002). Approximately $1,007,000 of the proceeds of 
the Sirrom Note were applied toward the repayment of the bank indebtedness and 
the balance toward working capital. The amount of the Sirrom Termination Fee 
was determined through arm's length negotiations between the Company and Sirrom 
based on factors, including the Company's interest in eliminating uncertainty 
with respect to its future equity-related liabilities and Sirrom's interest in 
receiving cash for relinquishment of its put option. 

The net proceeds, if any, received in connection with the exercise of the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option will be applied to working capital and may 
be used by the Company for financing receivables and inventory, personnel 
expense, additional sales and marketing expense and additional research and 
development expense. A portion of the net proceeds received by the Company may 
be used for the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or 
technologies. Although the Company has from time to time engaged in discussions 
with respect to possible acquisitions, it has no present understandings,
 commitments or agreements, nor is it currently engaged in any negotiations, 
with respect to any acquisition. None of the net proceeds of the Offering are 
specifically designated for payments to officers or Directors. 

Pending use of the net proceeds from this Offering, the Company intends to 
invest the net proceeds received by it in bank certificates of deposit, 
interest-bearing savings accounts, prime commercial paper, United States 
Government obligations, money market funds or similar short-term investments. 
Any income derived from these short-term investments is expected to be used for 
working capital. 

The amounts set forth above are estimates developed by management for the 
allocation of the net proceeds to be received by the Company from this Offering 
based upon the current state of the Company's existing and proposed business 
and prevailing economic conditions. These estimates are subject to reallocation 
by the Board of Directors among the applications listed above or to new 
applications and are further subject to future events, including changes in 
general economic conditions, the Company's business plan, and the financial 
markets in general. The Company will have broad discretion as to the 
application of such net proceeds. See ""Risk Factors -- Significant Unallocated

the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 
Such net proceeds have not been reduced by the amount of the Company's 
organizational and other operating expenses which were $153,411 as of November 
30, 1997. The net proceeds of this offering will be segregated until the Bank's 
receipt of final approvals from the OCC and the FDIC to commence banking 
operations, but will be available for certain organizational and pre-opening 
expenses of the Company and the Bank. 

Approximately $7.5 million of the net proceeds of this offering will be invested
by the Company in shares of Common Stock of the Bank to provide the Bank's 
initial capitalization. The Bank expects to use approximately $2,137,000 of 
these funds to acquire, construct, furnish and equip the permanent premises in 
which it is anticipated that the Bank will be located, and approximately 
$132,000 to cover occupancy expenses and necessary furniture, fixtures and 
equipment expense for the Bank's temporary offices during the period of 
construction of its main facility. It is currently anticipated that the 
remaining amount will be used by the Bank to fund investments in loans and U.S. 
government and agency securities, federal funds sold and for payment of 
operating expenses. 

The balance of the net proceeds of this offering, after capitalizing the Bank 
with $7.5 million, is estimated to be approximately $1,534,865. A total of 
approximately $366,000 has been advanced by the organizers to the Company to 
cover expenses of organizing the Bank. Under the terms of these advances, the 
organizers will receive repayment in full, on or about the closing of this 
offering, in shares of Common Stock valued at the Price to Public. The Company's
organizers also have indicated their present intention to purchase shares of 
Common Stock in this offering. See ""Principal Stockholders."" The remaining 
amount of net proceeds (plus any net proceeds as a result of the exercise of 
the Underwriter's over-allotment option) will initially be invested by the 
Company in an overnight repurchase agreement with the Bank secured by U.S. 
Treasury and Agency securities and otherwise will be held by the Company as 
working capital for general corporate purposes as well as for possible future 
capital contributions to the Bank to support asset growth. Such uses by the 
Company, however, may be subject to change. The Company believes that the net 
proceeds of the offering will satisfy the Company's cash requirements for at 
least the first 12 month period following the opening of the Bank.

year (prorated for partial years) accruing from June 1, 1997. The redemption 
price for the Series A Preferred Stock equals $1.00 per share plus accumulated 
and unpaid dividends on the redemption date. In accordance with the terms of 
the asset purchase agreement (the ""Asset Purchase Agreement"") entered into by 
the Company with the Predecessor Company and its owners, the parties to the

shares of Series A Preferred Stock in payment of such purchase price reduction.
 The Company does not have any obligation to pay any accrued dividends on such 
cancelled shares. The amount shown represents the estimated redemption price at 
January 30, 1998 of the remaining 1,095,915 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
 Upon completion of the Offering, the Company expects that it will redeem the 
Series A Preferred Stock on January 30, 1998. See ""Description of Securities --
 Series A Preferred Stock."" 


(3) In November 1997, the Company obtained a loan in the amount of $100,000 
from Michael J. Xirinachs, a founder of the Company and a Director of the 
Company, bearing interest at the rate of 24% per annum, and requiring repayment 
on February 11, 1998. The Company has also obtained a loan from Karen Bagley in 
the amount of $100,000, which bears interest at the rate of 24% per annum and 
is due and payable full upon demand. Upon completion of this Offering, the 
Company will use a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay the 
expected outstanding balance owing on each of these loans. See ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- 
Overview."" 

(4) Includes working capital and other ongoing selling, general and 
administrative expenses. See the Consolidated Financial Statements as of, and 
for the period ended September 30, 1997, included elsewhere in this Prospectus,
 for information about the Company's current working capital needs (including 
accounts payable and accrued expenses) and ongoing selling, general and 
administrative expenses. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Offering based upon the current state of its business 
development and management estimates of current industry conditions. The net 
proceeds may be reallocated among the categories set forth above or otherwise 
in response to, among other things, changes in the Company's business plans, 
future revenues and expenses and industry, regulatory or competitive 
conditions. The amount and timing of expenditures will vary depending on a 
number of factors, including changes in the Company's contemplated operations 
or business plans and changes in economic and industry conditions. Any such 
shifts will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and Officers of the 
Company. 
Pending such uses, the net proceeds of the Offering are expected to be invested 
in U.S. Government Securities or deposited in federally insured accounts of 
banks or money market accounts of other financial institutions, or invested in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing investments or other similar 
short-term investments."

offered hereby (after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company which have 
been or will be funded by advances from Mr. Snyder) will be approximately $79.8 
million (approximately $92.5 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment 
options are exercised in full). 

Of the $79.8 million net proceeds, the Company estimates that approximately 
$53.4 million will be used to pay the cash portion of the Acquisitions 
Consideration, all of which will be paid to former stockholders and other 
equity owners of the Founding Companies. Approximately $2.7 million of the net 
proceeds will be used to pay a portion of the cash transfers related to the 
Owner Amounts of certain Founding Companies. In addition, approximately $6.4 
million of the net proceeds will be used to repay the estimated outstanding 
indebtedness of the Founding Companies at the closing of the Offerings. The 
estimated outstanding indebtedness to be repaid from the proceeds of the 
Offerings bears interest at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
8.9% and matures at various dates from December 1997 through October 2012. In 
connection with the Acquisitions, the Company expects to issue approximately 
$13.3 million of notes payable to fund a portion of the Owner Amounts. 
Following the consummation of the Offerings, such notes payable to owners of 
the Founding Companies will be repaid with borrowings under the proposed credit 
facility. The Company will use a portion of the proceeds received from the 
Offerings to repay Mr. Snyder for the $4.8 million estimated offering costs 
expected to be advanced by him to the Company. Such advances amounted to 
approximately $1.6 million as of September 30, 1997. The initial $1 million of 
such advances bears interest at a stated rate (8.5% as of the date of this 
Prospectus), and additional advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%. See 
""Certain Transactions."" 

The approximately $17.3 million of remaining net proceeds ($30.0 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment options are exercised in full) will be used for 
working capital and for general corporate purposes, which are expected to 
include future acquisitions. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest 
the net proceeds of the Offerings in short-term, investment-grade, interest-
bearing securities. While the Company is continuously considering possible 
acquisition prospects as part of its growth strategy, the Company is not 
presently engaged in active negotiations with respect to any particular 
acquisition. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations -- Combined Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

The Company has reached an agreement to obtain a bank line of credit for $65 
million for working capital, capital expenditures, other corporate purposes and 
acquisitions. The line of credit will be subject to customary drawing 
conditions and the execution of certain loan documentation. See ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- 
Combined Liquidity and Capital Resources."""

Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be $5.0 million 
(approximately $5.6 million if the Over-Allotment Option granted to the 
Underwriters by the Company is excercised in full), at an initial public 
offering price of $4.00 per share and after deducting the estimated offering 
expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions payable by the Company. 

The Company expects to use the estimated net proceeds (i) to repay certain 
indebtedness, which was incurred to fund the working capital requirements of 
the Company's operations, of which $1.54 million will be paid to certain 
related parties (the ""Related Party Indebtedness""); (ii) to develop a national 
sales and marketing network, including hiring of additional sales personnel; 
(iii) to acquire and/or lease fixed assets, including bar-code equipment, 
prototype fabrication equipment, and equipment to upgrade the Company's 
information systems; (iv) to finance increased inventory levels to maximize 
efficiency and volume discounts; and (v) to establish domestic woven label 
capability for rapid turnaround of samples and short-run production. The 
balance of the net proceeds will be used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, including approximately $92,000 that will be distributed to 
Pacific Trim's shareholders to permit them to pay income taxes attributable to 
the earnings of Pacific Trim prior to the Termination Date. See ""The Company."" 

The Company anticipates allocating the net proceeds of the Offering among the 
foregoing uses approximately as follows:

The Company is also conducting the Offering to create a market for its Common 
Stock, to facilitate future access by the Company to the public equity markets 
and to enhance the Company's public image and credibility to support its 
marketing efforts, particularly its plans to create a national sales presence 
in the United States. 

Until the net proceeds of the Offering are used, the Company intends to invest 
them in United States government securities, short-term certificates of 
deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest bearing investments. 
The Company's management will have broad discretion as to the application of 
the net proceeds to the Company from the sale of Common Stock in the Offering. 
The Company may change the allocation of these proceeds in response to 
developments in the industries in which it operates and changes in the Company.

TIMBERLAND BANCORP INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/timberland-bancorp-inc-10445-9388,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/timberland-bancorp-inc-10445-9388,424B3,12/2/1997,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=844757,"The net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock offered hereby are
     estimated to range from $41.5 million to $56.5 million, or up to $65.2
     million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%.  See ""PRO
     FORMA DATA"" for the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts.  The
     Holding Company plans to contribute to the Savings Bank 50% of the net 
     proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock to the Savings Bank in exchange 
     for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Savings
     Bank, and retain the remaining net proceeds. This will result in the 
     Holding Company retaining approximately $20.8 million to $28.3 million of 
     net proceeds, or up to $32.6 million if the Estimated Valuation Range is 
     increased by 15%, and the Savings Bank receiving an equal amount.

          Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the Common Stock
     will increase the Savings Bank's capital and will support the expansion of
     the Savings Bank's existing business activities.  The Savings Bank will use
     the funds contributed to it for general corporate purposes, including,
     initially, local lending, investment in short term U.S. government and
     agency obligations and the possible repayment of outstanding FHLB advances.
     The Savings Bank may also use a portion of the net proceeds contributed to
     it to acquire or establish additional branch offices within its primary
     market area.  Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements,
     agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding any additional
     branching activities.

          In connection with the Conversion and the establishment of the ESOP,
     the Holding Company intends to loan the ESOP the amount necessary to
     purchase 8% of the shares sold in the Conversion.  The Holding Company's
     loan to fund the ESOP may range from $3.4 million to $4.6 million based on
     the sale of 340,000 shares to the ESOP (at the minimum of the Estimated
     Valuation Range) and 460,000 shares (at the maximum of the Estimated
     Valuation Range), respectively, at $10.00 per share.  If 15% above the
     maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range, or 6,612,500 shares, are sold in
     the Conversion, the Holding Company's loan to the ESOP would be
     approximately $5.3 million.  It is anticipated that the ESOP loan will have
     a 10-year term with interest payable at the prime rate as published in The
     Wall Street Journal on the closing date of the Conversion. The loan will be
     repaid principally from the Savings Bank's contributions to the ESOP and,
     if appropriate, from dividends payable on the Common Stock.

          The remaining net proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially
     will be invested primarily in short term U.S. government and agency
     obligations.  Such proceeds will be available for additional contributions
     to the Savings Bank in the form of debt or equity, to support possible
     future diversification or acquisition activities, as a source of dividends
     to the stockholders of the Holding Company and for future repurchases of
     Common Stock to the extent permitted under Washington law and federal
     regulations.  Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements,
     agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding any such
     activities.

          Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors will have
     the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and
     regulatory requirements.  Since the Holding Company has not yet issued
     stock, there is currently insufficient information upon which an intention
     to repurchase stock could be based.  The facts and circumstances upon which
     the Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future may
     include but are not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the
     price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading,
     the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of
     return and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the
     book value and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares,
     and the ability to improve the Holding Company's return on equity; (ii) the
     avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional
     shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock
     benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases would
     be in the best interests of the Holding Company and its stockholders. Any
     stock repurchases will be subject to a determination by the Board of
     Directors that both the Holding Company and the Savings Bank will be
     capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any
     such repurchases and that capital will be adequate, taking into account,
     among other things, the level of nonperforming and other risk assets, the
     Holding Company's and the Savings Bank's current and projected results of
     operations and asset/liability structure, the economic environment and tax
     and other regulatory considerations.  See ""REGULATION -- The Holding
     Company -- Stock Repurchases.""

          The consolidated capital levels of the Holding Company will be
     significant after the consummation of the Conversion as a result of the net
     proceeds from the Offerings.  See ""RISK FACTORS -- Return on Equity after
     Conversion,"" ""CAPITALIZATION,"" and ""HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA CAPITAL
     COMPLIANCE.""  In light of such capital levels, the Holding Company may 
     consider a possible post-Conversion tax-free distribution to stockholders 
     in the form of a return of capital. However, there are no current plans 
     regarding such a distribution and the Holding Company has committed to the 
     FDIC not to make any such distribution within the first year following the 
     consummation of the Conversion."
MYSTIC FINANCIAL INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/mystic-financial-inc-7271-9292,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/mystic-financial-inc-7271-9292,424B3,11/24/1997,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=1467950,"An amount equal to 50% of the net proceeds from the sale of the 
Common Stock ($8.6 million at the midpoint of the Current Valuation Range) will 
be added to the general funds of the Bank and used for general corporate 
purposes, including the origination of loans, funding the construction and/or 
acquisition costs of establishing new branch locations, and enhancing the 
Bank's liquidity ratios. The balance of the funds will be retained as the 
Company's initial capitalization, with a portion of those funds ($1,640,000 at 
the midpoint of the Current Valuation Range) being loaned to the ESOP to fund 
its purchase of Common Stock in the Offerings or, if necessary, to purchase 
shares of Common Stock through open-market purchases following completion of 
the Offerings. Pursuant to the Bank's Post-Conversion Supervision Policy, the 
Company may use the funds it retains to support future expansion of operations 
or diversification into other banking-related businesses and for other business 
or investment purposes, although management has no current plans regarding such 
activities. Subject to applicable limitations, the Company may also use 
available funds to repurchase shares of Common Stock and for the payment of 
dividends. Under FDIC regulations, the Bank is prohibited from repurchasing its 
capital stock within one year following its conversion to stock form, except 
that stock repurchases of no greater than 5% of the Bank's outstanding capital 
stock may be repurchased during the one year period where compelling and valid 
business reasons are established to the satisfaction of the FDIC. The Company 
may not reduce the amount or retire any part of its capital stock without the 
prior consent of the FDIC and the Commissioner. The Company will also comply 
with any applicable regulations of the FRB regarding the repurchase by the bank 
of its own capital stock. In addition, pursuant to its stock repurchase policy, 
the Company has agreed to submit any such stock repurchase within the one year 
period to the Commissioner for approval prior to engaging in any such stock 
repurchase. Any change in this policy will require the prior approval of the 
Commissioner. It is expected that in the interim, all or part of the net 
proceeds will be invested in U.S. Government and Agency securities and other 
short-term investments and used to reduce FHLB borrowings. 

The Bank has structured an array of commercial services administered and run by 
the Bank's commercial loan department which are designed to give business 
owners borrowing opportunities for modernization, inventory, equipment, 
construction, consolidation, real estate, working capital, vehicle purchases 
and the refinancing of existing corporate debt. In the past two years, the Bank 
has made a major commitment to small business commercial lending. The Bank has 
worked to develop a niche of making commercial loans to companies which have 
from $500,000 to $15 million in sales and has recently become an approved 
lender of the Small Business Administration. The Bank has expanded its 
commercial lending department with the addition of two senior officers with 
considerable commercial lending expertise and has developed a support staff to 
run the commercial loan department. Conversion proceeds are expected to be 
deployed to fund the Bank's traditional one- to four-family residential lending, 
as well as the expanded commercial lending activities. There is no specific 
amount the Bank plans to allocate to its lending operation. The Bank has 
experienced strong loan demand and anticipates that a portion of the proceeds 
will be used to fund additional loans, thereby reducing the Bank's reliance on 
deposits and borrowings for funding needs. 

Although the Bank opened a new office at 201 Salem Street in November 1995, 
which has been successful, especially on the commercial lending front, the 
Bank's lending and deposit gathering activities are limited by the fact that it 
currently operates from only three full service locations and one student-run 
educational branch located at Medford High School. Accordingly, the Bank is 
pursuing establishing one or more other branch locations either de novo, or by 
purchasing an existing deposit base and/or location. The Bank has performed 
feasibility studies of certain locations, and is considering a plan to 
establish a new branch at one of these locations. Although there can be no 
assurance that the Bank's branching efforts will be successful, the Bank 
expects to apply a portion of the Conversion proceeds to fund the construction 
and/or acquisition of one or more additional branch locations. The Bank is 
reviewing the feasibility of expanding its branch network and continues to 
review various locations on an ongoing basis. However, there are no specific 
plans or sites which have been identified by the Bank as probable locations and 
there are no current negotiations for the acquisition of branch locations 
other than inquiries as to availability and cost. Expansion beyond four offices 
will facilitate expanded services and increased loan originations within the 
Bank's existing underwriting standards. 
The total number of shares of the Common Stock to be issued in the Conversion 
cannot be stated with certainty at this time, because it will depend upon the 
estimated pro forma market value of the Common Stock at the time of sale. See 
""The Conversion -- Stock Pricing and Number of Shares to be Issued."" However, 
the net proceeds to the Company would be approximately $17,257,000 based upon 
the assumptions that (i) 2,050,000 shares of Common Stock are sold at a 
purchase price per share of $10.00 for an aggregate of $20,500,000 
(the midpoint of the Current Valuation Range), (ii) the Conversion expenses are 
$782,780 in the aggregate and (iii) ESOP and Restricted Stock Plan purchases 
are $1,640,000 and $820,000, respectively. 

The actual net proceeds may be more or less than the estimated amount because 
the total proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock may be significantly more 
or less than the midpoint of the Current Valuation Range and because actual 
Conversion expenses may be more or less than those currently expected. The 
following table indicates the total gross proceeds, estimated Conversion 
expenses and estimated net proceeds, assuming the Common Stock is sold at the 
minimum, midpoint and maximum of the Current Valuation Range, and at the 
Super-Maximum (which is 15% above the maximum of the Current Valuation Range 
and is the highest amount of Common Stock that may be sold without further 
solicitation of subscribers).

net proceeds from the sale of the Conversion Stock are estimated to range from 
$41.4 million to $56.2 million (or $64.7 million if the Valuation Price Range 
is increased by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data."" The Company plans to contribute to 
the Bank 50% of the net proceeds and retain the remaining net proceeds. This 
would result in the Company retaining approximately $24.4 million of net 
proceeds (50% of $48.8 million) based on the issuance of 5,000,000 shares at 
the midpoint of the Valuation Price Range. 

Receipt of the net proceeds of the sale of the Conversion Stock will increase 
the Bank's capital. The Bank will use the funds contributed to it for general 
corporate purposes, including increased lending, possible purchase of loan 
participations or investment in U.S. Government or agency securities and 
mortgage backed securities of the type currently held by the Bank. In addition, 
depending on the level of market interest rates following consummation of the 
Conversion, the Bank may use a portion of the proceeds to retire any 
outstanding FHLB advances. 

In connection with the Conversion and the establishment of the ESOP, the 
Company intends to loan the ESOP the amount necessary for it to acquire 2% of 
the shares issued in the Conversion. The Company's loan to fund the ESOP may 
range from $850,000 to $1,000,000 to $1,150,000 based on the sale of 4,250,000 
shares (at the minimum of the Valuation Price Range), 5,000,000 shares (at the 
midpoint of the Valuation Price Range), and 5,750,000 shares (at the maximum of 
the Valuation Price Range), respectively, at $10.00 per share. If 15% above the 
maximum of the Valuation Price Range, or 6,612,500 shares, are sold in the 
Conversion, the Company's loan to the ESOP would be approximately $1,323,000. 

The remaining net proceeds retained by the Company initially will be invested 
primarily in investment securities of the type currently held by the Bank. Such 
proceeds will be available for additional contributions to the Bank in the form 
of debt or equity, to support future acquisition and diversification activities, 
as a source of dividends to the stockholders of the Company and for future 
repurchases of Common Stock to the extent permitted under applicable law and 
regulations. Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements, agreements 
or understandings, written or oral, regarding any diversification or acquisition 
activities. The Conversion will also facilitate the Company's access to the 
capital markets. 

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors will have the 
authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and regulatory 
requirements. Since the Company has not yet issued stock, there is currently 
insufficient information upon which an intention to repurchase stock could be 
based. The facts and circumstances upon which the Board of Directors may 
determine to repurchase stock in the future may include but are not limited to: 
(i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment, 
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in the Company's return on 
equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue 
additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee 
stock benefit plans; (iii) the ability of the Company to utilize pooling of 
interests accounting treatment in connection with future mergers and 
acquisitions; and (iv) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in 
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Any stock repurchases 
will be subject to a determination by the Board of Directors that both the 
Company and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory 
requirements after any such repurchases and that capital will be adequate 
taking into account, among other things, the level of nonperforming and other 
risk assets, the Company's and the Bank's current and projected results of 
operations and asset/liability structure, the economic environment and tax and 
other regulatory considerations. During the first 12 months following 
completion of the Conversion, the Company generally may not, without prior 
approval of the FDIC, repurchase in the aggregate more than 5% of the shares 
outstanding upon completion of the Conversion."

Offering, the $1,100,000 in proceeds generated from Group's sale of its 200,000 
shares of Common Stock in the Minimum Offering. This $1,100,000 will be paid to 
the Company to satisfy, in their entirety, all receivables then outstanding from 
Medley Refrigeration to the Company. Group, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement 
controlling the disbursement of subscription proceeds at the closing of the 
Minimum Offering, has authorized the Escrow Agent to remit directly to the

______________________________________

(1) The Company will satisfy a portion of its outstanding short term 
indebtedness and a portion of its long-term indebtedness with a portion of the 
proceeds from this offering. Loans from Messrs. Press, Edelson and Steven 
Dreyer, directors of the Company, will be repaid with a portion of these 
proceeds. Specifically, Mr. Press will receive $76,000 in complete satisfaction 
of all indebtedness of the Company owing to him (Mr. Press has waived all 
interest payments), Mr. Edelson will receive $45,000 in complete satisfaction of 
all indebtedness of the Company owing to him (Mr. Edelson waived all interest 
payments) and an affiliate of Mr. Dreyer will receive $14,333.10 in partial 
satisfaction of certain indebtedness of the Company owing to it. The $121,000 
in loans being repaid with the proceeds from this offering to Messrs. Press and 
Edelson were incurred to finance the Company's operating expenses in connection 
with, and in anticipation of, this Offering.  
(2) On each of August 20, 1996, November 20, 1996 and February 20, 1997, the 
Company declared its regular quarterly cash dividend with respect to shares of 
its Convertible Preferred Stock. At the time of each of the aforementioned 
dividend declarations, the Company had sufficient cash available to pay the 
dividend to all holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock other than Messrs. 
Press, Edelson and Dreyer and holders affiliated or related to them. The Company 
will utilize a portion of the proceeds from this offering to satisfy all 
declared, but unpaid dividends.  
(3) The Company intends to utilize a portion of the proceeds from this offering 
to expand its refrigeration equipment leasing business. Specifically, the 
Company anticipates broadening and intensifying its marketing efforts to 
attract equipment lessees unaffiliated with Medley Refrigeration. In addition, 
the Company intends to expand its geographic positioning and business plan by 
entering into geographic marketplaces in which Medley Refrigeration does not 
currently do business and by marketing to other refrigeration companies that do 
not compete directly with Medley Refrigeration. To date, the Company has lacked 
the capital necessary to expand its business as presently contemplated. 
(4) The Company intends to utilize a portion of the proceeds from this offering 
to establish a factoring business which will provide small to medium sized 
companies with capital through the discounted purchase of such companies' 
accounts receivable. The expansion into the factoring business will require the 
Company to hire additional marketing and administrative personnel. The Company 
intends to implement a direct marketing campaign to introduce the Company's 
factoring services to entities in the Miami, Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, 
Florida markets. 
(5) The Company will utilize $165,000 from this offering to redeem, at a price 
of $5.50 per share, an aggregate of 30,000 shares of Common Stock owned by 
Messrs. Robert D. Press and Steven L. Edelson, the President and Chairman of 
the Board of the Company, respectively. These shares were transferred and 
assigned by Group to Messrs. Press and Edelson in January 1996 in consideration 
for services performed by them on behalf of the Company.  
(6) Working capital will be utilized by the Company to enhance, and otherwise 
stabilize, cash flow during the initial 12 months following the consummation of 
this offering, such that any shortfalls between operating revenues and costs 
will be covered by working capital. Although the Company prefers to retain its 
working capital in reserve, the Company may be required to expend part or all 
of these proceeds as financial demands dictate. 

Although it is uncertain whether the Company's shares of Common Stock will rise 
to a level at which the Warrants would be exercised, in the event subscribers 
in this offering elect to exercise all of the Warrants offered herein, the 
Company will realize gross proceeds of approximately $6,900,000 if the Minimum 
Offering is sold and $9,200,000 if the Maximum Offering is sold. Management 
anticipates that the proceeds from the exercise of the Warrants would be 
contributed to working capital of the Company. Nonetheless, the Company may, at 
the time of exercise, allocate a portion of the proceeds to any other corporate 
purpose. Accordingly, investors who exercise their Warrants will entrust their 
funds to management, whose specific intentions regarding the use of such funds 
are not presently and specifically known. 

The amounts set forth in the above use of proceeds table merely indicate the 
proposed use of proceeds and actual expenditures may vary substantially from 
these estimates depending upon economic conditions and the success, if any, of 
the Company's existing and proposed new businesses. The Company is unable to 
predict the precise period for which this offering will provide financing, 
although management believes that the Company should have sufficient working 
capital to meet its cash requirements for approximately 12 months from the date 
of this Prospectus. Accordingly, the Company may need to seek additional funds 
through loans or other financing arrangements during this period of time. No 
such arrangements exist or are currently contemplated and there can be no 
assurance that they may be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company in the 
future should the need arise. 

Pending utilization, management intends to make temporary investment of the 
proceeds in bank certificates of deposit, interest bearing savings accounts, 
prime commercial paper or federal government securities."

purchase all of the capital stock we will issue in connection with the 
Conversion. A portion of the net proceeds to be retained by SFSB Holding 
Company will be loaned to our employee stock plan to fund its purchase of 8% 
of the shares sold in the Conversion. On a short-term basis, the balance of the
 net proceeds retained by SFSB Holding Company initially will be invested in 
short-term investments. Although there are no current plans, the net proceeds
 subsequently may be used to fund acquisitions of other financial services
 institutions or to diversify into non-banking activities. The net proceeds 
may also serve as a source of funds for the payment of dividends to 
stockholders or for the repurchase of the shares. A portion of the net proceeds
 may also be used to fund the purchase of 4% of the shares for a restricted
 stock plan (the RSP) which is anticipated to be adopted following the 
Conversion. See ""Pro Forma Data."" 

The funds we receive from the sale of our capital stock to SFSB will be added
 to our general funds and be used for general corporate purposes including: 
(i) investment in mortgages and other loans, (ii) investment in U.S. Government
 and federal agency securities, (iii) investment in mortgage-backed securities 
or (iv) funding loan commitments. However, initially we intend to invest the
 net proceeds in short-term investments until we can deploy the proceeds into
 higher yielding assets. The funds added to our capital will further strengthen
 our capital position. 

The net proceeds may vary because the total expenses of the conversion may be
 significantly more or less than those estimated. We estimate our expenses to
 be approximately $320,000. Our estimated net proceeds will range from 
$4,355,000 to $6,005,000 (or up to $6,953,750 in the event the maximum of the
 estimated valuation range is increased to $7,273,750). See ""Pro Forma Data.""
 The net proceeds will also vary if expenses are different or if the number of
 shares to be issued in the conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in our
 estimated pro forma market value. Payments for shares made through withdrawals
from existing deposit accounts with us will not result in the receipt of new
 funds for investment by us but will result in a reduction of our liabilities
 and interest expense as funds are transferred from interest-bearing
 certificates or accounts."

(1) The Bridge Financing was completed in October 1997, with the proceeds used 
to finance operations and provide working capital to the Company. 
The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Offering. This estimate is based upon certain assumptions, 
including that no events occur which would cause the Company to abandon any 
particular efforts, that competitive conditions remain stable, that the 
Company's product and service activities will occur as projected and that 
revenue levels and headcount do not differ materially from management's 
expectations. The amounts actually expended for each purpose may vary 
significantly in the event any of these assumptions prove inaccurate. The 
Company reserves the right to change its use of proceeds, as unanticipated 
events may cause the Company to redirect its priorities and reallocate the 
proceeds accordingly. 

A portion of the proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use 
complementary technologies. While from time to time the Company may evaluate 
potential acquisitions of such businesses, products or technologies, there are 
no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any 
acquisition of other businesses, products or technologies. 

Any additional proceeds received upon exercise of the Over-Allotment Option, 
the Underwriter's Warrants or the Warrants will be added to working capital. 
Pending utilization, the net proceeds of the Offering will be invested in short-
term, interest-bearing investments."

(1) The Bridge Financing was completed in October 1997, with the proceeds used 
to finance operations and provide working capital to the Company. 
The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Offering. This estimate is based upon certain assumptions, 
including that no events occur which would cause the Company to abandon any 
particular efforts, that competitive conditions remain stable, that the 
Company's product and service activities will occur as projected and that 
revenue levels and headcount do not differ materially from management's 
expectations. The amounts actually expended for each purpose may vary 
significantly in the event any of these assumptions prove inaccurate. The 
Company reserves the right to change its use of proceeds, as unanticipated 
events may cause the Company to redirect its priorities and reallocate the 
proceeds accordingly. 

A portion of the proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use 
complementary technologies. While from time to time the Company may evaluate 
potential acquisitions of such businesses, products or technologies, there are 
no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any 
acquisition of other businesses, products or technologies. 

Any additional proceeds received upon exercise of the Over-Allotment Option, 
the Underwriter's Warrants or the Warrants will be added to working capital. 
Pending utilization, the net proceeds of the Offering will be invested in short-
term, interest-bearing investments."

  The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
to repay amounts due to NationsBank, N.A. under its line of credit. As of

February 1, 2000 and bear interest at the prime lending rate plus 1.0%. The
remainder of the net proceeds will be used for continued vertical market and

capital expenditures. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering to expand its business through acquisitions. Although the
Company expects to complete the acquisition of two companies prior to the
closing of this offering and continues to explore prospective acquisition
opportunities, the Company does not currently have any commitments for
business acquisitions subsequent to the closing of this offering. See

of factors, including the Company's revenue growth, asset growth, cash flow

offering will be invested in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
securities. The Company currently anticipates that the net proceeds to be

(4) Includes: (i) $968,000 for the repayment of principal on the promissory 
note issued in December 1995 as part of the Debt Financing (as defined herein), 
which note bears interest at 10% per annum; (ii) $122,400 for repayment of 
principal and accrued interest (8% per annum) on a certain loan to the Company 
from a third party during the second quarter of 1997 which is due upon the 
consummation of this Offering; (iii) $404,600 for repayment of principal and

(5) Represents costs associated with leasing or buying additional computers and 
the additional machinery required to commence the Company's planned small-scale

If the Underwriters exercise the Over-allotment Option in full, the Company

added to the Company's working capital. 
The Company anticipates, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the net proceeds of this Offering, together 
with its projected cash flow from operations, if any, will be sufficient to 
satisfy the Company's contemplated cash requirements for approximately 12 to 18 
months following the closing date of this Offering. In the event that the 
Company's plans change or its assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or 
if the net proceeds of this Offering or the Company's projected cash flow prove 
to be insufficient to fund operations (due to unanticipated expenses, 
manufacturing problems, marketing difficulties or otherwise), the Company may 
find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within the 
above-described categories, or to use portions of the net proceeds for other 
purposes or may be required to seek additional financing or curtail its 
operations. The Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or sources 
of, additional financing and it is not anticipated that existing stockholders 
will provide any portion of the Company's future financing requirements. There 
can be no assurance that any such additional financing will be available to the 
Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any inability to obtain 
additional financing when needed would have a material adverse effect on the 
Company, requiring it to curtail or possibly cease operations. See 'Risk 
Factors -- Need for Substantial Additional Funds; Uncertainty of Additional 
Financing' and 'Plan of Operation.' 
The Company may use all or a portion of the $495,000, or 15.43% of the net 
proceeds from the Offering allocated to working capital, to acquire all or a 
portion of existing companies in businesses which the Company believes are 
compatible with its business including, but not limited to, competitors of the 
Company. Any decision to make an acquisition will be based upon a variety of 
factors, including, among others, the purchase price and other financial terms 
of the transaction, the business prospects and competitive position of and the 
nature of any formulations, designs or products and the extent to which any 
acquisition would enhance the Company's prospects. The Company is not currently 
engaged in identifying any potential acquisition and has no plans, agreements, 
understandings or arrangements for any acquisitions. There can be no assurance 
that the Company will be able to successfully consummate any acquisition or, if 
it does, that it will successfully integrate into its business any acquired 
product or business. See 'Risk Factors -- Risks Associated with Proposed 
Expansion.' 

Pending utilization of the net proceeds of the Offering, the Company may make 
temporary investments, in among other things, bank certificates of deposit, 
short-term interest-bearing investments equivalent to commercial paper, prime 
commercial paper, United States government obligations and money-market funds."

Prior to such use, the remaining net proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings
 under the Warehouse Facility. The net proceeds, if any, from the exercise of 
the Underwriters' over-allotment option will be utilized to reduce borrowings 
under the Warehouse Facility. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the sale of the Shares based upon the Company's operations, the
 Company's business plan, and current economic and industry conditions and is 
subject to reapportionment of proceeds among the categories listed above or to 
new categories in response to, among other things, changes in the Company's 
plans, regulations, industry conditions, and future revenues and expenditures.
 The amount and timing of expenditures will vary depending on a number of
 factors, including changes in the Company's operations or business plan and 
changes in economic and industry conditions. 

Based on the operating plan, the Company believes that the net proceeds of this
 Offering, together with revenues from continuing operations, will be 
sufficient to satisfy its capital requirements and finance its plans for 
expansion for at least the next 12 months. Such belief is based upon certain 
assumptions, and there can be no assurance that such assumptions are correct.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such resources will satisfy the 
Company's capital requirements for said period. The Company may require 
additional financing in order to expand its operations. Such financing may take 
the form of the issuance of common or preferred stock or debt securities, 
and/or may involve bank or other lender financing. There can be no assurance 
that the Company will be able to obtain needed additional capital on a timely 
basis, on favorable terms, or at all."

of the proceeds of the Offering will be used to fund research, development and 
commercialization programs, for general working capital purposes and, assuming 
the scale-up of the 9 MW plant is successful, the Company's equity capital 
requirements for the Future Expansion.

in full) after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses. Such expenses include a fee of $750,000 which the Company 
has agreed to pay to Foster Management Company for its assistance in effecting 
the Offering. The Company has paid approximately $600,000 of offering expenses 
as of the date of this Prospectus, which amount was drawn down by the Company 
from its 8% subordinated term notes due January 15, 2007, thereby resulting in 
an actual $42.8 million of net proceeds from the Offering ($49.5 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). See ""Certain 
Transactions."" 
The Company intends to apply approximately $38.9 million of the net proceeds of 
the Offering to retire certain indebtedness of the Company and to pay all 
accrued but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock outstanding prior to the 
Offering as follows: (i) $11.6 million to repay the outstanding balance of the 
Company's 8% subordinated term notes due December 1, 2006, together with 
accrued interest; (ii) $5.0 million to repay the outstanding balance of the 
Company's 8% subordinated term notes due January 15, 2007, together with 
accrued interest; (iii) $15.5 million to repay the outstanding balance of the

accrued interest; 
(iv) $2.5 million to repay the outstanding balance of the 6% redeemable 
promissory note due December 31, 1998, together with accrued interest; (v) $3.0 
million to repay the outstanding balance of the Company's 6% subordinated 
convertible promissory notes due December 1, 2000, together with accrued 
interest; (vi) $1.0 million to repay all of the amount borrowed by the Company 
from an institutional lender pursuant to a demand line of credit (the ""Credit 
Facility"") (which bears interest at the Company's option at (a) the greater of 
(x) such lender's prime rate (which at January 15, 1998 was 8.5%), or (y) the 
federal funds rate (which at January 15, 1998 was 5.36%) plus 0.5% or (b) the 
eurodollar rate (which at January 15, 1998 was 5.59%) plus 2%, together with 
accrued interest and (vii) $300,000 to pay all accrued but unpaid dividends on 
the Preferred Stock outstanding prior to the Offering. Substantially all of the 
foregoing indebtedness relates to the Company's acquisitions and has been used 
primarily to fund the cash portions of the purchase prices for acquisitions 
made by the Company during 1996 and 1997 and to pay expenses related thereto. 
See Notes 7 and 9 of Notes to the Company's Combined Financial Statements, 
""Capitalization"" and ""Certain Transactions"" for further information concerning 
such indebtedness. The remaining net proceeds will be added to the Company's 
working capital and will be used to finance future acquisitions and internal 
growth. Pending such use, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term investment grade, interest-bearing, certificates of deposit or 
guaranteed obligations of the United States. The Company plans to augment its 
internal growth by acquiring companies with businesses that offer complementary 
services. However, no portion of the proceeds of the Offering has been 
allocated for any specific future acquisitions, nor has the Company entered 
into any agreements or letters of intent with respect to any future 
acquisitions. 
DIVIDEND POLICY Since the Recapitalization in December 1996, the Company has 
not paid a cash dividend on its Common Stock. It is the current policy of the 
Company's Board of Directors to retain any earnings to finance the operations 
and expansion of the Company's business. Holders of the Company's Preferred 
Stock, Series 1998, are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as 
the Board of Directors may declare from time to time with respect to shares of 
Common Stock out of funds legally available therefor on the basis of 8.33 times 
the dividends paid per share of Common Stock, appropriately adjusted for any 
stock splits, stock dividends or similar events affecting the Common Stock. The 
payment of cash dividends in the future will depend on the Company's results of 
operations, financial condition and capital needs and on other factors deemed 
pertinent by the Company's Board of Directors. In addition, pursuant to its 
anticipated credit agreement with NationsBank, N.A., the Company will be 
prohibited from declaring and paying any dividends during the term of such 
agreement. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operation -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."""

approximately $77.1 million and net borrowings under the New Credit Agreement 
of approximately $127.6 million, to complete the Refinancing Plan, which is 
expected to consist of: (i) the redemption of all of the Zero Coupon Notes for 
$99.8 million (including a redemption premium of $7.0 million), (ii) the 
redemption of all of the Senior Notes for $93.9 million (including a redemption 
premium of $4.0 million), (iii) the repayment of all outstanding term loan 
indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement, the outstanding principal 
amount of which was $65.3 million as of December 27, 1997, (iv) the repayment 
of all outstanding revolving indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement, 
the outstanding principal amount of which was $24.5 million as of December 27, 
1997, and (v) the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 
Refinancing Plan. The Company plans to use the proceeds of the Offering, the 
Notes Offering and a portion of the proceeds from the New Credit Agreement to 
fund the redemption of the Zero Coupon Notes and the Senior Notes. Accordingly, 
the proceeds from the Offering and the Notes Offering will be used to defease 
the Zero Coupon Notes and the Senior Notes pending such redemptions, which the 
Company currently expects to occur approximately 30 days after the closing of 
the Offering. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares 
of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. 

The term loan indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement has a maturity 
date of June 2002 and currently bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 
3.0%, which, as of September 30, 1997, equaled approximately 8.8%. The 
revolving loan indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement has a maturity 
date of June 2001 and currently bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 
2.5%, which, as of September 30, 1997, equaled approximately 8.3%, and provides 
for a commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% per annum on the unused 
portion of the facility, depending on the Company's ratio of consolidated debt 
to EBITDA (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement). The Zero Coupon Notes 
have a maturity date of September 2004 and accrete at a fixed rate of 15% per 
annum compounded semiannually, with cash interest payments commencing in March 
2000 at a fixed rate of 15% per annum. The Senior Notes have a maturity date of 
September 2002 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 12% per annum."

See ""Certain Transactions."" 

Approximately $1.6 million of the indebtedness expected to be repaid by the 
Company out of the net proceeds of the Offering was borrowed from a stockholder 
of the Company pursuant to a line of credit and two promissory notes, all of 
which bear interest at the prime interest rate plus 2%. The line of credit 
provides for maximum borrowings of $250,000 and matures in February 1999. 
Initial borrowings under the two promissory notes were $250,000 and $1.1 million
and such promissory notes mature in September 1998 and July 1998, respectively. 
The remainder of the indebtedness being repaid was incurred under the Credit 
Facility (as defined), which bears interest at the lender's prime interest rate 
plus 1.5% and matures on July 31, 1998.

(1) Represents net proceeds allocated to construct three Lundy's restaurants. 
The Company estimates that the cost to construct a Lundy's restaurant will be 
approximately $1,500,000 per location (net of anticipated landlord 
contributions) and that the cost, if any, to open such restaurants in excess of 
the net proceeds of this offering allocated for such purpose will be financed 
through cash flow from operations, equipment and vendor financing and landlord 
development concessions and rent allowances. In connection with its expansion 
strategy, to the extent appropriate opportunities arise, the Company may use a 
portion of such proceeds to open high-volume landmark-type restaurants. In the 
event that cash flow from operations is insufficient or that the Company is 
unable to obtain adequate equipment, vendor or landlord financing, or other 
unexpected events occur, such as delays in identifying suitable locations, 
negotiating leases, obtaining permits or design and construction delays, the 
Company will not be able to open all of such locations in a timely manner, or 
at all. See ""Business --Expansion Strategy"" and ""-- Site Selection."" 
(2) Includes costs of general corporate overhead, capital expenditures for 
existing restaurants and maintaining inventory. To the extent cash flow from 
operations is insufficient, such proceeds may be used to finance the pre-
opening expenses of Lundy's restaurants. 

If the Underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full, the Company 
will realize additional net proceeds of $659,025, which will be added to the 
Company's working capital. 

The allocation of the net proceeds from this offering set forth above 
represents the Company's best estimate based upon its currently proposed plans 
and assumptions relating to its operations and certain assumptions regarding 
general economic conditions. If any of these factors change, the Company may 
find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within the 
above-described categories or to use portions thereof for other purposes. 

Based on the Company's current proposed plans and assumptions relating to the 
implementation of its expansion strategy (including the timetable of opening 
American Park and new Lundy's locations and the costs associated therewith), 
the Company anticipates that the net proceeds of this offering, together with 
anticipated cash flow from operations and equipment, vendor and landlord 
financing, will be sufficient to satisfy its contemplated cash requirements for 
at least 12 months following the consummation of this offering. In the event 
that the Company's plans change or its assumptions prove to be inaccurate 
(due to unanticipated expenses, construction delays or other difficulties) or 
the proceeds of this offering otherwise prove to be insufficient to fund 
operations and implement the Company's proposed expansion strategy, the Company 
could be required to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated. Because 
the Company's strategy is to open a limited number of high-volume restaurants, 
the costs associated with opening any such restaurant may vary substantially. 
Other than the ability to enter into bartering transactions with member dining 
clubs, the Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or potential 
sources of, additional financing, and it is not anticipated that any officers, 
directors or stockholders will provide any additional loans to the Company. 
Consequently, there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be 
available to the Company when needed, on commercially reasonable terms, or at 
all. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 


Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest 
bearing investments."

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $28.9 
million and $39.4 million (or $45.4 million if the Estimated Price Range is 
increased by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion--Stock Pricing"" as 
to the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Company will be unable 
to utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offerings until the consummation of 
the Conversion. 

The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank to 
be issued upon Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the 
Offerings, with the remaining net proceeds to be retained by the Company. Based 
on net proceeds of $39.4 million and the assets of the Bank as of September 30, 
1997, the Company expects to utilize $19.7 million of net proceeds to purchase 
the common stock of the Bank. Such portion of net proceeds will be added to the 
Bank's general funds which the Bank currently intends to utilize for general 
corporate purposes, including: investment in loans, particularly residential, 
commercial real estate and construction and development loans; investment in 
federal funds; the repayment of FHLB advances; funding of stock-based benefit 
plans; and, to a lesser extent, investment in short-term mortgage-backed and 
mortgage-related securities. The Bank may also use such funds for the expansion 
of its facilities and to expand operations through acquisitions of other 
financial institutions, branch offices or other financial services companies. 
The Bank has not yet determined the approximate amount of net proceeds to be 
used for any of the purposes mentioned above. 

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains to 
capitalize the ESOP Loan Subsidiary which intends to loan funds to the ESOP to 
enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of the Common Stock issued in the Conversion, 
including shares issued to the Foundation. The Company and Bank may 
alternatively choose to fund the ESOP's stock purchases through a loan by a 
third-party financial institution. The remaining net proceeds retained by the 
Company will initially be invested in short-term mortgage-backed and mortgage-
related securities. Based upon the sale of 1,508,750 shares or 2,041,250 shares 
at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated Price Range and the issuance of 
shares to the Foundation, the amount of the loan to the ESOP would be $2.6 
million or $3.5 million, respectively (or $4.1 million if the Estimated Price 
Range is increased by 15%) to be repaid approximately over a ten year period at 
the prevailing prime rate of interest, which currently is 
8.5%. See ""Management of the Bank--Benefits--Employee Stock Ownership Plan and 
Trust."" 

The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the future 
expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment of 
branch offices and the acquisition of smaller financial institutions or their 
assets, including those located within the Bank's market area or 
diversification into other banking related businesses. The Company has no 
current arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding any such 
opportunities or transactions. The Company, upon the Conversion, will be a 
unitary savings and loan holding company, which under existing laws would 
generally not be restricted as to the types of business activities in which it 
may engage, provided that the Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender 
(""QTL""). See ""Regulation--Holding Company Regulation"" for a description of 
certain regulations applicable to the Company. 

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company will 
have the authority to conduct stock repurchases, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, the Company, pursuant to 
OTS regulations, will be prohibited from repurchasing any shares of the Common 
Stock for three years except (i) for an offer to all stockholders on a pro rata 
basis, or (ii) for the repurchase of qualifying shares of a director. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided below, beginning one year 
following completion of the Conversion, the OTS regulations permit the Company 
to repurchase its Common Stock so long as: (i) the repurchases within the 
following two years are part of an open-market program not involving greater 
than 5% of its outstanding capital stock during a 12-month period; (ii) the 
repurchases do not cause the Bank to become ""undercapitalized"" within the 
meaning of the OTS prompt corrective action regulation; and (iii) the Company 
provides to the Regional Director of the OTS no later than 10 days prior to the 
commencement of a repurchase program written notice containing a full 
description of the program to be undertaken and such program is not disapproved 
by the Regional Director. See ""Regulation--Prompt Corrective Regulatory 
Action."" In addition, under current OTS policies, repurchases may be allowed in 
the first year following Conversion and in amounts greater than 5% in the 
second and third years following Conversion provided there are valid and 
compelling business reasons for such repurchases and the OTS does not object to 
such repurchases. 

Based upon facts and circumstances following the Conversion and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but 
not be limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which 
the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness 
of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk 
involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or 
earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares and the opportunity to 
improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders. Although the Company has no current plans to 
repurchase its stock, in the event the Company does determine to repurchase 
stock, such repurchases may be made at market prices which may be in excess of 
the Purchase Price in the Conversion. 
Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of 
Directors that both the Company and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of 
all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that such 
capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, the level of 
non-performing and other risk assets, the Company's and the Bank's current and 
projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic 
environment, tax and other considerations. See ""The Conversion--Certain 
Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares after Conversion."" 

While the Company's Board of Directors intends to consider a policy of paying 
cash dividends in the future, the Board has not currently formulated a policy 
with respect to the payment of dividends. The payment of dividends or 
repurchase of stock, however, would be prohibited if stockholders' equity would 
be reduced below the amount required to maintain the Bank's liquidation account.

Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After Conversion."""

The net proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares may vary depending upon 
financial and market conditions at the time of the completion of the Offering. 
See ""THE CONVERSION - Pricing and Number of Common Shares to be Sold."" The 
expenses detailed above are estimated. Actual expenses may be more than or less 
than estimated. See ""THE CONVERSION Plan of Distribution."" 

The Holding Company will retain up to 50% of the net proceeds from the sale of 
the Common Shares, or approximately $11.0 million at the maximum, as adjusted, 
of the Valuation Range. Such proceeds will be used to lend an amount equal to 
8% of the proceeds of the Offering to the ESOP to acquire Common Shares in the 
Offering and the balance of the proceeds will be invested initially in short-
term investments. The loan to the ESOP will have a term of 15 years and an 
interest rate equal to the applicable federal rate published periodically by 
the IRS, which is currently 5.93%. The ESOP loan will be repaid through cash 
contributions to the ESOP from the Bank and the use of any dividends paid on 
the unallocated ESOP shares. Ultimately the proceeds will be used for general 
corporate purposes, which may include payments of dividends, repurchases of 
Common Shares and funding of the RRP. See ""THE CONVERSION - Restrictions on 
Repurchase of Common Shares."" OTS regulations generally prohibit stock 
repurchases in the first year following the completion of the Conversion, 
without prior approval of the OTS. 

The remainder of the net proceeds received from the sale of the Common Shares, 
approximately $11.0 million at the maximum, as adjusted, of the Valuation 
Range, will be invested by the Holding Company in the capital stock to be 
issued by the Bank to the Holding Company as a result of the Conversion and 
will increase the regulatory capital of the Bank and will permit the Bank to 
expand its lending and investment activities and to enhance customer services. 
The Bank anticipates that such net proceeds will initially be invested in 
short-term investments with maturities of one year or less and utilized for 
general corporate purposes, including loan originations."

30 days following consummation of the Offering, (vi) approximately $486,000 
will be used to repay 15.0% promissory notes issued by the Company subsequent 
to December 31, 1997 to fund certain offering and operating expenses, which 
notes mature three days following consummation of the Offering, and (vii) 
approximately $276,000 will be used to purchase certain accounts receivable, 
net of accounts payable, of the Founding Affiliated Practices. The remaining 
net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which are expected to 
include future acquisitions and future capital expenditures. Pending such uses, 
the net proceeds will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-
grade securities. The promoters (including the dentist-owners of the Founding 
Affiliated Practices), officers and directors of the Company will receive an 
aggregate of approximately $7.7 million out of the net proceeds of the 
Offering. Other than with respect to the Affiliations, the Company currently 
has no agreement or understanding with respect to any future affiliation. See 
""Risk Factors--Proceeds of Offering Payable to Affiliates"" and ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--
Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

The consideration being paid by the Company in connection with each Affiliation 
was determined by negotiations between executive officers of the Company not 
affiliated with any Founding Affiliated Practice and a representative of that 
Founding Affiliated Practice. The Company used the same valuation method to 
negotiate the consideration being paid to each of the Founding Affiliated 
Practices, including the respective practices wholly owned by Drs. Reed, 
Andress, Clarke, Greder, Kay and Yaros, which method was based upon the 
Founding Affiliated Practice's gross revenue, net of certain operating 
expenses, and the Company's assessment of growth potential. See ""Certain 
Transactions"" for information concerning the identification of the owners of 
the Founding Affiliated Practices and the respective amounts of cash being paid 
to them out of the proceeds of the Offering and shares of Common Stock being 
issued to them in connection with the Affiliations. 

The indebtedness of the Founding Affiliated Practices to be repaid bears 
interest at an average rate of 8.0% and would otherwise mature at various dates 
through 2002."

proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock to be sold by the Company will 
be approximately $54,085,000 (approximately $61,962,000 if the Underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option in full) after deduction of underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the 
Company. 

The principal purposes of the Offering are to increase the Company's equity 
capital, to create a public market for the Common Stock, to facilitate future 
access by the Company to public equity markets, to provide liquidity to certain 
of the Company's existing stockholders and to provide increased visibility and 
credibility to the Company in a marketplace where many of its competitors are 
publicly-held companies. 

The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering for 
working capital and general corporate purposes, including financing accounts 
receivable and capital expenditures made in the ordinary course of its 
business, as well as for possible acquisitions of businesses, products and 
technologies that are complementary to those of the Company. Although the 
Company has not identified any specific businesses, products or technologies 
that it may acquire, nor are there any current agreements or negotiations with 
respect to any such transactions, the Company from time to time evaluates such 
opportunities. Pending such uses, the net proceeds will be invested in 
government securities and other short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing

the Offering to: (i) facilitate the development of manufacturing capacity for 
EARTHSHELL products by engineering, developing and constructing turnkey 
manufacturing lines for lease to licensees or contribution to joint ventures 
(approximately $63.0 million); (ii) expand the EARTHSHELL product development

technology; and (vi) establish a fund for the enforcement and protection of 
patents ((v) and (vi) together, approximately $7.4 million). 

In addition, approximately $50.9 million of the net proceeds of the Offering 
will be used by the Company to repay certain indebtedness owed to its principal 
stockholder, EKI (approximately $36.9 million in principal, accrued interest 
and accounts payable as of February 28, 1998), and Imperial Bank (approximately 
$14.0 million as of February 28, 1998). The debt owed to EKI, which was 
incurred at various times between February 1995 and the date hereof, bears 
interest at the prime rate published in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL as adjusted on 
the first day of each calendar quarter, and is due and payable upon demand by 
EKI. At December 31, 1997, this indebtedness bore interest at an annual rate of 
8.5%. The indebtedness to Imperial Bank, which was incurred at various times 
between June 1996 and the date hereof bears interest at an annual rate of 1% in 
excess of the Bank's prime lending rate as announced from time to time. At 
December 31, 1997, this indebtedness bore interest at an annual rate of 9.5%.

Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

The remaining net proceeds (approximately $55.2 million) will be used by the 
Company for general corporate purposes, including the employment of additional 
personnel, the continued design and development of EARTHSHELL products and 
anticipated operating losses. Except as indicated, the Company cannot presently 
determine the specific amounts of funds, and the timing of any payments, that 
may be required in connection with the use of the portion of the net proceeds 
allocated to general corporate purposes. The Company's management will have 
broad discretion in applying the net proceeds, and the Company reserves the 
right to change the use of proceeds if unanticipated developments in the 
Company's business or changes in economic or competitive conditions make shifts

$18,931,000 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). 
The net proceeds from this Offering will be used by the Company as follows: (i) 
approximately $3,000,000 to expand marketing and advertising efforts and 
potential strategic alliances with Internet search engines guides and online 
communities; (ii) approximately $500,000 to repay a secured loan made to the 
Company by the Trustees of the General Electric Pension Trust which accrues

Electric Pension Trust are being utilized for working capital purposes. Jeffrey 
S. Tauber pledged 172,500 of his shares of Common Stock as security for the 
loan. See ""Risk Factors -- Management's Broad Discretion in Allocating a 
Substantial Portion of the Proceeds,"" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Conditions and Results of Operations,"" ""Business -- Certain

From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company evaluates 
possible acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, products and 
technologies that are complementary to those of the Company. A portion of the 
net proceeds may therefore be used to fund acquisitions or investments. The 
Company currently has no arrangements, agreements or understandings, and is not 
engaged in active negotiations, with respect to any such acquisition or 
investment. 

Pending the application of the net proceeds from this Offering, the Company 
intends to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-
bearing instruments or money market funds. To the extent necessary to avoid 
being subject to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act of 
1940, as amended, the Company would invest the balance in United States 
Treasury obligations. Returns on such investments may be less than those that 
might otherwise result if the Company were able to use such funds immediately 
in its operations."

Stock offered hereby are estimated to be $61.4 million after deducting the

offering are to obtain additional capital, repay certain existing and expected 
indebtedness, create a public market for the Common Stock and facilitate future 
access to public markets. Shortly after this offering, the Company expects to 
begin to use approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds to repay existing 
($3.0 million at December 31, 1997) and expected future indebtedness under the 
Company's working capital line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. 
Such indebtedness bears interest at the bank's prime rate plus 1%, is 
collateralized by accounts receivable and matures in December 1998. In 
addition, beginning in January 1999, the Company expects to begin to use a 
portion of the proceeds to repay aggregate indebtedness of $8.0 million that it 
incurred in March 1998 pursuant to its working capital line of credit agreement 
with Transamerica Business Credit Corporation and MMC/GATX Partnership No. 1. 
This indebtedness bears interest at 12.95% and, if this offering is completed, 
will mature in January 2000. The Company expects to use the remaining net 
proceeds primarily for working capital and other general corporate purposes to 
fund the Company's operations, including payment of salaries and benefits for 
the Company's personnel, costs associated with the operation of the Company's 
network, payments under leases and scheduled monthly payments of principal and 
interest on outstanding and any future indebtedness. See ""Risk Factors--Broad 
Management Discretion in Allocation of Proceeds."" A portion of the proceeds 
also may be used to repay other indebtedness, to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use 
complementary technologies. See Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. In the 
ordinary course of business, the Company evaluates potential acquisitions of 
such businesses, products or technologies. However, the Company has no present 
understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition of 
businesses, products or technologies. Pending use of the net proceeds for the 
above purposes, the Company intends to invest such funds in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. In addition to the use of the 
net proceeds from the offering, the Company also expects during the next 12 
months to meet its capital and working capital requirements through existing 
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash from sales of 
services and proceeds from existing and future equipment loans and lease lines 
and working capital lines of credit and possibly other borrowings. See ""Risk

capital expenditures such as the expansion of research facilities, as well as 
the purchase of additional laboratory automation equipment, production

""Description of Capital Stock--Preferred Stock."" The Company expects to use the 
balance of the net proceeds for research and development, including internal 
discovery programs, the further development of its GeneCalling, PathCalling and 
HitCalling databases and working capital and general corporate purposes. The 
amounts actually expended for each purpose, other than the amount expended for 
the redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock, may vary significantly 
depending upon numerous factors, including progress of the Company's internal 
programs and research and development projects, the number and breadth of these 
programs, achievement of milestones under collaborative arrangements, the 
ability of the Company to establish and maintain research collaborations and 
database subscriptions, and the progress of the development efforts of the 
Company's collaborators and subscribers. These factors also include the level 
of the Company's activities relating to commercialization of rights it has 
retained in its collaborative arrangements, competing technological and market 
developments, the costs involved in the defense, prosecution and enforcement of 
patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the costs and timing

between $105.6 million and $143.2 million ($164.7  million  assuming an increase
in the Offering Price Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" as to the  assumptions
used to arrive at such amounts.
         Bancshares plans to contribute to the Bank 50% of the net proceeds from
the  Offerings  and  retain  the  remainder  of the net  proceeds.  The  Company
anticipates  that after the loan to the ESOP and after  contributing  50% of the
funds raised in the  Conversion  and  Reorganization  to the Bank,  it will have
approximately  $60.0 million (based upon the sale of 14,490,000 shares of Common
Stock)  which it intends to loan to the Bank.  The Bank will invest these funds,
initially in short  interest-bearing  deposits and short and  intermediate  term
securities.  The Company  intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to make a
loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8.0% of the  Conversion
Stock.  Based upon the issuance of 10,710,000  shares and  14,490,000  shares of
Conversion  Stock at the  minimum  and  maximum  of the  Offering  Price  Range,
respectively,  the loan to the ESOP  would be $8.6  million  and $11.6  million,
respectively. It is anticipated that the loan to the ESOP will have a term of
not less than 20 years and a fixed rate of  interest at the prime rate as of the
date of the loan. See ""MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK -- Employee Stock Ownership Plan.""
The net proceeds  retained by Bancshares  also may be used to support the future
expansion of operations or diversification into other banking-related businesses
and for other  business or investment  purposes,  including the  acquisition  of
other  financial  institutions  and/or  branch  offices,  although  there are no
current  plans,  arrangements,   understandings  or  agreements  regarding  such
expansion,  diversification or acquisitions. The Bank does, however, continually
evaluate  additional  branching  opportunities  that  will  complement  existing
operations or support  expansion into new markets.  The Bank owns certain vacant
land in its  market  area  which may be used for branch  expansion  in 1998.  No
assurance can be given,  however, that such expansion will occur during 1998. In
addition,  subject to applicable regulatory  limitations,  the net proceeds also
may be used to repurchase shares of Common Stock,  although Bancshares currently
has made no decision concerning the repurchase of shares following  consummation
of the Conversion and Reorganization.  See ""THE CONVERSION AND REORGANIZATION --
Certain  Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares after the Conversion and
Reorganization."" The portion of the net proceeds contributed to the Bank will be
used for general corporate  purposes,  primarily  investment in residential real
estate  loans and will be  initially  used to  invest  primarily  in  short-term
interest-bearing deposits and marketable securities.
         In addition,  a portion of the proceeds may be used to fund open market
purchases of Common Stock for the  Recognition  Plan if such plan is approved by
shareholders.  The estimated cost of such plans is dependent upon the price paid
for the shares in the open market. If Common Stock equal to 4% at the maximum of
the Offering Range, or 579,600 shares, was purchased for the Recognition Plan at
$10 per share, the cost would be $5.8 million. See ""MANAGEMENT OF HARBOR FEDERAL

$439.9 million and $597.2 million ($687.7 million assuming an increase in the 
Estimated Price Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" as to the assumptions used 
to arrive at such amounts. 

The Company plans to use 50% of the net proceeds from the Offerings to purchase 
all the outstanding common stock of the Bank issued in the Conversion and 
retain the remainder of the net proceeds. The net proceeds retained by the 
Company will be initially used to invest primarily in investment securities and 
mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities. The Company intends to use a 
portion of the net proceeds to make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the 
ESOP to purchase 8.0% of the Common Stock sold in the Offerings. Based upon the 
issuance of 45,254,630 shares and 61,226,852 shares at the minimum and maximum 
of the Estimated Price Range, respectively, the loan to the ESOP would be $36.2 
million and $49.0 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the loan to the 
ESOP will have a term of not less than 20 years and a fixed interest rate at 
the Bank's prime rate as of the date of the loan. See ""Management -- Benefits 
-- Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" The net proceeds from the Offerings also may 
be used by the Company and the Bank to support future expansion of retail 
banking operations or diversification into other businesses, through 
acquisitions or otherwise, including the potential acquisition of other 
financial institutions and/or branch offices. There are no current plans, 
arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding such diversification or 
acquisitions. 

Subject to applicable regulatory limitations and then-existing circumstances, 
the net proceeds also may be used by the Company to repurchase shares of Common 
Stock, although the Company currently has no plans of effecting any such 
transactions following consummation of the Conversion. Pursuant to Department 
regulations, the Company may not repurchase any Common Stock in the first year 
after Conversion and, during each of the next two following years, may only 
repurchase up to 5% of its outstanding capital stock during each 12 month 
period. In addition, the FDIC prohibits an institution which has converted from
 mutual to stock form of ownership from repurchasing its capital stock within 
one year following the date of its conversion to stock form, except that stock 
repurchases of no greater than 5% of a bank's outstanding capital stock may be 
repurchased during this one-year period where compelling and valid business 
reasons are established to the satisfaction of the FDIC. Based upon facts and 
circumstances following the Conversion and subject to applicable regulatory 
requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to repurchase shares of 
Common Stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but are 
not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the
 Common Stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the 
attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return 
and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value 
and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the 
opportunity to improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of 
dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the 
exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) 
any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of 
the Company and its stockholders. In the event the Company determines to 
repurchase stock, such repurchases may be made at market prices which may be in 
excess of the Purchase Price. To the extent that the Company repurchases stock 
at market prices in excess of the Purchase Price, such repurchases may have a 
dilutive effect upon the interests of existing stockholders. Any stock 
repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of Directors that 
the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory 
requirements after any such repurchases and that such capital will be adequate, 
taking into account, among other things, the level of nonperforming and other 
risk assets, the Company's and the Bank's current and projected results of 
operations and asset/liability structure, the economic environment, tax and 
other considerations. See ""The Conversion -- Certain Restrictions on Purchase
 or Transfer of Shares after the Conversion."" The portion of the net proceeds 
contributed to the Bank will be used for general corporate purposes, including 
investment in loans and investment and mortgage-backed securities."

(1) Includes (i) $1,390,000 in 15% notes payable issued by the Company to 
various individuals to mature on March 31, 1998, (ii) $278,000 in 15% notes 
payable issued by the Company to various individuals to mature on March 31, 
2000 and (iii) $474,000 in 15% notes payable issued by the Company to various 
individuals to mature on December 31, 2000, the proceeds of which were used to 
fund capital expenditures for the development of two additional stores. 

The exact allocation of the proceeds for such purposes and the timing of such 
expenditures may vary significantly depending upon numerous factors, including 
the number of stores to be developed by the Company. Pending the application of 
such proceeds, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds of this Offering 
in short-term, investment-grade securities. The Company estimates that such 
proceeds together with the proceeds from anticipated commercial credit 
facilities will be sufficient to fund such expenditures and other cash 
requirements for the next 12 months. However, if the Company fails to obtain 
such credit facilities, the Company may be required to delay the development of 
new stores. Over the longer term, it is likely that the Company will require 
additional capital to fund its anticipated growth. The Company has no present 
plans, proposals, arrangements, commitments, agreements or understandings with 
respect to any acquisitions. However, the Company may use a portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire additional stores or other pawnshop companies. See

from $47.4 million to $64.3 million, or to $74.0 million if the Estimated
Valuation Range is increased by 15%, depending upon the number of shares sold
and the expenses of the Stock Conversion. The Holding Company has received
conditional OTS approval to purchase all of the capital stock of the Bank to be
issued in the Stock Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the
Offerings. This will result in the Holding Company retaining approximately $23.7
million to $32.2 million of the net proceeds, or up to $37.0 million if the
Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%, from which the Holding Company
will fund a loan to the ESOP, and the Bank receiving an equal amount.

     Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the Common Stock will
increase the Bank's capital and will support the expansion of the Bank's
existing business activities. The Bank will use the funds contributed to it for
general corporate purposes, including, initially, lending and investment in
short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations.
 
     A portion of the net proceeds retained by the Holding Company will be used
for a loan by the Holding Company to the ESOP to enable it to purchase 8% of the
shares of Common Stock issued in the Stock Conversion. Such loan would fund the
entire purchase price of the ESOP shares ($5,244,000 at the maximum of the
Estimated Valuation Range) and would be repaid principally from the Bank's
contributions to the ESOP and from dividends payable on the Common Stock held by
the ESOP. The remaining proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially will
be invested primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. Such
proceeds will be available for additional contributions to the Bank in the form
of debt or equity, to support future growth and diversification activities, as a
source of dividends to the stockholders of the Holding Company and for future
repurchases of Common Stock (including possible repurchases to fund the MRP or
to provide shares to be issued upon exercise of stock options) to the extent
permitted under Tennessee law and OTS regulations. The Holding Company will
consider exploring opportunities to use such funds to expand operations through
acquiring or establishing additional branch offices and the acquisition of other
financial institutions. Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements,
agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding any such activities."

the Representative's Warrants), after deducting estimated underwriting 
discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company, are estimated to be 
approximately $23.0 million. The Company intends to use (i) approximately $3 
million of such proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes and 
(ii) the balance of approximately $20.0 million to finance the development of 
new adult living communities. However, delays or difficulties in obtaining 
financing or project development could cause the Company to use the portion of 
such net proceeds intended for development to acquire additional existing adult 
living communities and for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
Management Contract Obligations. The Company anticipates that most of the 
construction loans it obtains to finance the development and lease-up costs of 
the new adult living communities will fund approximately 80% of such costs, 
requiring the Company to contribute approximately 20% of such costs. The 
Company estimates that the cost of developing each new adult living community 
utilizing construction financing (including reserves necessary to carry the 
community through its lease-up period) will be approximately $9.5 million. The 
Company will use approximately $20.0 million of its net proceeds of this 
Offering to fund the portion of development costs not provided by construction 
financing, which is currently anticipated to be sufficient to permit the 
development of approximately 11 of the 30 to 34 new adult living communities on 
which the Company plans to commence construction over the next two years if 
such proceeds funded approximately 20% of the development costs. The Company 
anticipates that the proceeds of this Offering and funds generated by its 
business operations will be sufficient to fund approximately 20% of these 
development costs for a period of at least 12 months at the anticipated rate of 
development. In order to maintain its development program at its projected 
level beyond this 12-month period, the Company intends to utilize the proceeds 
of anticipated refinancings of construction financing on, and/or sale-
leasebacks of, stabilized, newly constructed communities at higher principal 
amounts than the original construction financing, or raise additional funds 
through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities to fund the 
development costs not provided by construction financing and/or utilize long 
term leases or similar forms of financings which require the investment of 
little or no capital on the part of the Company. Although the Company has 
obtained financing for the eight adult living communities whose construction is 
completed or currently under construction, the Company does not have 
commitments for construction financing for any of the 30 to 34 new adult living 
communities on which the Company plans to commence construction over the next 
two years. The Company believes that it will be able to obtain such needed 
additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will 
be able to obtain the financing and/or sale-leasebacks, or complete any 
additional debt or equity offerings, necessary to complete its development plan.

Proceeds,"" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""Business --

Pending the uses outlined above, funds will be placed into short term 
investments such as governmental obligations, bank certificates of deposit, 
banker's acceptances, repurchase agreements, short term debt obligations, money 
market funds, and interest bearing accounts. The Company has not established 
investment criteria for such short-term investments."

Common Stock offered by the Selling Shareholders hereby. See ""Principal and

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase the Company's 
capitalization and financial flexibility, to create a public market for the 
Company's Common Stock, to facilitate future access by the Company to public 
equity markets, to provide liquidity to existing shareholders, to provide 
increased visibility and credibility in a market in which many of the Company's

offering are to increase the Company's equity capital, to create a public
market for the Common Stock, to facilitate future access by the Company to
public equity markets and to provide liquidity for the Company's existing
stockholders.
  The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds for the repayment
of the outstanding balance under its secured credit facility with People's
Bank, of which $858,000 was outstanding as of December 31, 1997. The facility
bears interest at the bank's prime rate plus 0.5% per annum (9.0% as of
December 31, 1997). Amounts outstanding under such credit facility were used
by the Company for working capital purposes. The credit facility matures on
August 15, 1998. The Company also intends to use a portion of the net proceeds
to pay accumulated and unpaid dividends on its Series A convertible preferred
stock, par value $.01 per share (the ""Series A Convertible Preferred Stock""),
and Series B convertible preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the
""Series B Convertible Preferred Stock""), upon the Preferred Stock Conversion
(which dividends were equal to an aggregate of $75,474 as of December 31, 1997
and are anticipated to be an aggregate of approximately $300,000 upon the
consummation of this offering). The actual amount of the accumulated dividends
to be paid with a portion of the net proceeds will be based on the period of
time the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are actually
outstanding. The Company intends to use the balance of the net proceeds from
this offering (i) to expand its sales and marketing capabilities by increasing
the size of its sales force and recruiting staff and expanding its marketing
and promotional programs and (ii) for general corporate purposes, including
working capital. The Company may also use a portion of such net proceeds for
acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to those of the Company.
While the Company from time to time evaluates such potential acquisitions, the
Company currently has no understandings, commitments or agreements with
respect to any acquisitions. The Company has not determined the amounts it
plans to expend with respect to each of the expected uses or the timing of
such expenditures. As a consequence, management will have the discretion to
allocate the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts actually expended
for each use may vary significantly depending on a number of factors,
including the amount of future revenue, the amount of cash generated or used
by the Company's operations, the progress of the Company's sales and marketing
efforts, the success of the Company's recruiting efforts, the status of
competitive services and acquisition opportunities presented to the Company.
Pending such uses, the net proceeds to the Company from this offering will be
invested in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.

(1) Includes approximately $2,100,000 for purchases of inventories, 
approximately $500,000 for purchases of software and capital equipment not 
related to manufacturing or research and development and approximately $490,000 
for the reduction of accounts payable. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the offering during the next 18 to 24 months. This estimate is 
based on certain assumptions, including that no events occur which would cause 
the Company to abandon any particular efforts, that competitive conditions 
remain stable, that the Company's manufacturing facility expansion will occur 
as projected and that the Company does not enter into collaborations to fund 
facility expansion separately. The amounts actually expended for each purpose 
may vary significantly in the event any of these assumptions prove inaccurate. 
The Company reserves the right to change its use of proceeds as unanticipated 
events may cause the Company to redirect its priorities and reallocate the 
proceeds accordingly. 

A portion of the net proceeds may also be used for investments in or 
acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies, although no 
such transactions are presently contemplated or currently under negotiations. 
Pending such uses, the Company expects to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment grade securities. 

The Company plans to finance its working capital and other capital resource 
needs with its current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from future 
operations, if any, and proceeds from this offering. The Company believes that 
these resources will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and other 
capital needs for at least the next 24 months."

used to fund planned expansion in existing markets. Pending new market 
expansion or land acquisition opportunities, a portion of the net proceeds will 
be used to repay a portion of the outstanding balances under the Company's 
construction credit facilities. Borrowings under such credit facilities bear 
interest at rates ranging from prime plus 0.5% to prime plus 1.5% per annum,

Of the net proceeds, the Company estimates that approximately $28.7 million 
will be used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the Founding 
Companies, all of which will be paid to the stockholders of the Founding 
Companies. The remainder of the purchase price for the Founding Companies will 
be paid by the issuance of 6,720,000 shares of Common Stock to their 
stockholders. The total value of the cash and stock paid for the Founding 
Companies will equal $82.4 million (based on an estimated fair value per share 
equal to the assumed initial public offering price less a marketability 
discount of 20%). In addition, approximately $15.5 million of the net proceeds

closing of the Offering. Of that $15.5 million, (i) approximately $5.1 million 
is owed by Maumee to a financial institution, bears interest at 1.5% over the 
bank's base rate or 10% at December 31, 1997 and matures May 31, 2000 and (ii) 
approximately $7.1 million of the $9.8 million currently outstanding under a 
line of credit provided to Alatec by a financial institution, bears interest at 
the prime rate or 8.5% at December 31, 1997 and matures in June 1999. The 
remaining indebtedness of $3.3 million to be repaid from the proceeds of the 
Offering consists of various notes payable that bear interest ranging from 6.2% 
to 9.3% and mature at various dates through January 2002. See ""Certain 
Transactions."" After the consummation of the Offering and the Acquisitions and 
after giving effect to the application of the proceeds as described above and 
to the anticipated draw down on the Company's credit facilities, described 
below, to pay off the Founding Companies' current indebtedness, the Company 
expects to have a total of $10.8 million in debt outstanding. 

The Company has obtained a commitment from a bank for a credit facility of $50 
million. The bank has also committed to use its best efforts to form a 
syndicate for an additional $25 million credit facility. The Company intends to 
use such facilities for working capital, payoff of indebtedness of the Founding 
Companies, and acquisitions. The credit facilities will be subject to customary

Acquisition, but it regularly engages in discussions relating to potential 
acquisitions. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to 
acquire racing-related businesses in the near future.

Company is indebted to Torchmark Corporation and to Liberty National Life 
Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Torchmark Corporation 
(""Liberty""), under the terms of two promissory notes dated November 22, 1997, 
in the original aggregate principal amounts of approximately $90 million 
payable to Torchmark Corporation (the ""Torchmark Note"") and of approximately 
$390 million payable to Liberty (the ""Second Liberty Note""). The Torchmark Note 
and the Second Liberty Note each mature on November 25, 2002 and bear interest 
at an annual rate of 8%. The Torchmark Note and the Second Liberty Note were 
distributed by the Company as a dividend. In addition, the Company is indebted 
to Liberty under the terms of a promissory note dated December 31, 1996, in the 
original aggregate principal amount of approximately $124 million, that matures 
on May 1, 2000 and bears interest at an annual rate of 6% (the ""First Liberty 
Note""). The First Liberty Note was issued in connection with an intercompany 
funding arrangement. 

Prior to the Offering, the Company prepaid outstanding amounts remaining under 
the Notes to the extent necessary so that the remaining aggregate principal 
amount of the Notes equals the net proceeds of the Offering (including net 
proceeds to be realized from any exercise of the over-allotment option in 
excess of $35.0 million). See ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions--
Relationship with Torchmark--Intercompany Debt."" 

The net proceeds of the Offering (other than the net proceeds from any exercise 
of the over-allotment option) will be applied to prepay the outstanding amounts 
due under the Notes. Net proceeds from the exercise of the over-allotment 
option will be retained by the Company for general corporate purposes to the 
extent of $35.0 million, and the excess over $35.0 million, if any, will be 
used to prepay the Notes to Torchmark."

consideration to be paid to the Founding Companies is subject to post-closing 
adjustment. Approximately $14.3 million of the net proceeds will be used to 
repay certain indebtedness assumed by the Company in the Acquisitions. See 
""Certain Transactions."" The indebtedness to be repaid from the proceeds of the 
Offering bears interest at effective rates up to 11.0%, with a weighted average 
interest rate of 8.4%. Such indebtedness would otherwise mature at various 
dates through 2006. Approximately $440,000 of the net proceeds will be used to 
pay a finders' fee in connection with the Company's acquisition of Bomar.

customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the Credit

offering to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Redeemable Preferred 
Stock as required by the terms of such shares. In connection with such 
redemption, the difference between the book value and the redemption value of 
approximately $4.1 million will be recorded as accretion of Preferred Stock 
when determining income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per 
share. This $4.1 million of accretion will be recorded in the second quarter of 
fiscal 1998 when the offering is completed and together with the anticipated 
charge to in-process research and development related to the acquisition of SIS 
Microelectronics will result in a loss attributable to common stockholders and 
a loss per share in that quarter. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds of the 
offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. A portion of the 
net proceeds may also be used for investments in or acquisitions of 
complementary businesses, products or technologies, although no such 
transactions are currently under negotiation. Pending such uses, the Company 
expects to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing securities."

Conversion will depend upon the total number of shares actually sold in the 
Offerings and the actual expenses of the Conversion. As a result, the actual 
net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock cannot be determined until the 
Conversion is completed. It is presently estimated that the net proceeds from 
the Offerings will be between $5,500,000 and $7,600,000, based on the current 
Estimated Valuation Range, after deduction for $450,000 in estimated expenses. 
The independent appraisal on which the aggregate purchase price of the Common 
Stock is based will be updated immediately prior to completion of the Stock 
Conversion. Such update could cause the appraisal and the aggregate purchase 
price of the Common Stock to be increased to $9,257,500 without a 
resolicitation of subscribers, resulting in estimated net proceeds of 
$8,807,500. The Company has received regulatory approval from the Administrator
 to purchase all of the capital stock of the Converted Savings Bank to be 
issued in the Stock Conversion in exchange for approximately 83% of the net 
proceeds after deducting the cost of the ESOP loan. Based on the sale of 
700,000 shares of Common Stock at the midpoint of the Estimated Valuation Range
 and assuming the purchase of eight percent of the shares to be issued in the 
Stock Conversion by the ESOP, the Savings Bank would receive approximately 
$5,000,000 in cash, and the Company would retain approximately $990,000 in cash
 and $560,000 in the form of a note receivable from the ESOP. The ESOP note 
receivable will be for a ten-year term and carry an interest rate equal to the 
prime rate as published in The Money Rates Column of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, 
adjusted on an annual basis. 

The proceeds retained by the Company, after funding the ESOP, initially will be
 invested in short-term and intermediate-term securities including cash and 
cash equivalents and U.S. government and agency obligations. Such proceeds will
 be available for a variety of corporate purposes, including funding the MRP, 
if implemented, future acquisitions and diversification of business, additional
 capital contributions, dividends to shareholders, and future repurchases of 
the Common Stock to the extent permitted by applicable regulations. 
Approximately $1,800,000 of the proceeds to be transferred to the Converted 
Savings Bank will be used to purchase land and construct a building for a new 
branch office. The Company and the Savings Bank currently have no other 
specific plans, intentions, arrangements, or understandings regarding 
acquisitions, branch purchases, capital contributions, or stock repurchases and
 does not contemplate any such acquisitions or stock repurchases within the 
twelve months following the Conversion. In addition, proceeds retained by the 
Company will be available to be loaned to the Commercial Bank if necessary in 
the event and to the extent loan growth exceeds deposit growth or for other 
corporate purposes. Subject to regulatory and other considerations, the Company
 intends to establish a semi-annual cash dividend following the Conversion at 
an initial rate of approximately $0.20 per share (an annual rate of $0.40 per
 share, or four percent, based on the $10.00 per share Purchase Price), 
commencing during the first six months subsequent to the Stock Conversion. See
 ""Dividend Policy."" Due to the limited nature of the Company's business 
activities, the Company believes that the net proceeds retained after the Stock
 Conversion, earnings on such proceeds and payments on the ESOP note receivable
 will be adequate to meet the Company's financial needs until dividends are
paid by the Commercial Bank; however, no assurance can be given that the 
Company will not have a need for additional funds in the future. For additional
 information, see ""Regulation -- Depository Institution Regulation -- Dividend 
Restrictions."" A portion of the net proceeds may be used to acquire shares of 
Common Stock pursuant to the MRP if the MRP is implemented. See ""Management of
 the Savings Bank -- Certain Benefit Plans and Agreements -- Stock Option 
Plans"" and "" -- Management Recognition Plan."""

With approximately $1,500,000 of the proceeds of this Offering, Industrial 
Rubber plans to purchase a facility or otherwise develop the capacity to sell 
and distribute steel and iron products. Approximately $1,500,000 of the 
proceeds are intended to be used to purchase a facility or otherwise develop 
the capacity for recycling, mixing, molding and calendaring rubber. 
Approximately $850,000 will be used to acquire existing businesses or to 
purchase equipment and obtain facilities for satellite production and 
distribution. Approximately $850,000 will be used to fund additional 
development of proprietary engineered products, improved rubber formulas and 
production processes and marketing and sales activities. Approximately 
$675,000 will be used to repay a bank loan to the Company, the proceeds of 
which will be used for an S Corporation distribution to the existing 
shareholder to enable him to pay income taxes resulting from the Company's 
earnings through December 31, 1997. The remainder of the proceeds will be used 
for working capital and general corporate purposes, including funding increased 
inventory and accounts receivables. Any additional proceeds received upon the 
exercise of the overallotment option or the Underwriter's Warrant will be used 
for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Since Industrial Rubber has not entered into any acquisition or material 
equipment purchase agreements, there can be no assurance that it will able to 
carry out its expansion plans for the amounts budgeted. 

Pending utilization of the net proceeds of this Offering, the Company plans to 
invest such net proceeds in short-term money market investments, including 
money market funds, certificates of deposit and interest-bearing bank accounts. 


The Company believes that the proceeds of this Offering, together with cash on 
hand, interest expected to be earned thereon, anticipated revenues and bank 
borrowings will be sufficient to fund its operations and expansion plans for at 
least 12 months."

proceeds from the Offering to conduct research and product development 
activities. The balance of the net proceeds (approximately $2.4 million) will 
be used to expand the Company's sales and marketing capabilities and to 
consolidate and equip its facilities, as well as for working capital or other 
general corporate purposes. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest 
the proceeds of the Offering in short term, investment grade, interest-bearing

Elan has agreed to purchase in private placement transactions concurrently with 
the closing of the Offering the Elan Shares for approximately $15.74 million. 
Simultaneously with such purchases, the Company will repay the Elan Notes, 
including interest thereon. See ""Transactions Related to the Offering"" and 
""Certain Transactions."" 

The actual amount expended and the timing of the use of the net proceeds of the 
Offering for each purpose set forth in the preceding paragraph may vary 
significantly depending upon a number of factors, including the costs and 
timing of the Company's research and development activities, the number and 
type of clinical tests the Company is required to conduct in seeking approval 
of its products from governmental agencies, the success of the Company's 
developmental efforts, the costs and timing of the expansion of the Company's 
sales and marketing activities, the extent to which the Company's existing and 
new products gain market acceptance, the Company's ability to maintain existing 
collaborative relationships and enter into new collaborative relationships, 
competing technological, market and patent developments, the progress of the 
Company's commercialization efforts and the commercialization efforts of the 
Company's distributors and co-marketers, the costs involved in preparing, 
filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other

From the net proceeds of the Offering, the Company will repay any amounts 
outstanding under its line of credit. The line of credit provides for the 
Company to borrow, subject to certain conditions, up to $8,000,000, secured by 
certain of the assets of the Company, at an interest rate of the commercial 
lender's prime rate plus one-half percent per year. As of March 31, 1998, the 
Company had no advances outstanding under this line of credit. This line of 
credit, in part, will be used to fund the LLC Distribution and to make 
additional distributions to the stockholders of Manhattan LLC based on income 
earned from January 1, 1998 through the date of the Restructuring. See ""Risk

to repay a Grid Promissory Note (the ""1995 Note"") payable to its Chairman of 
the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, Alan J. Dabbiere. The 1995 
Note is payable on demand and bears interest at a rate of 5% per year. As of 
February 28, 1998, the balance of the 1995 Note (including accrued interest) 
was $1,937,000. 

The remaining net proceeds will be used for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes. Such purposes may include the funding of new product 
development efforts and possible acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses 
and technologies that are complementary to those of the Company. The Company 
has no specific agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any 
such acquisitions or investments. The amounts actually expended for each

amount,  approximately $5.9 million will be used to fund the cash portion of the
consideration  for the  acquisition  of Roda,  and  approximately  $1.4  million

The Roda  Acquisition.""  The Roda Seller Debt,  which has no specified  maturity
date,  bears  interest  at the  rate of 10% per  annum,  payable  semi-annually.
Pursuant to the Roda Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to cause Roda to
repay  the  Roda  Seller  Debt  within  28 days  following  the  closing  of the
Acquisition.  In addition,  the Company intends to use $4.8 million to repay the
Reorganization  Notes,  representing  a  portion  of  the  consideration  in the
Reorganization  to the  stockholders  of the  Predecessor  and  undistributed  S
corporation  taxable  income upon which they have already  paid taxes.  See ""The
Company -- The  Reorganization.""  The Reorganization  Notes bear no interest and
have no specified  maturity  date.  The Company also intends to repay up to $1.0
million of  indebtedness  to Summit Bank under its term loan and all outstanding
borrowings  under its  revolving  line of credit with Summit  Bank,  expected to
total $1.2  million as of the  consummation  of the  Offering.  The  Predecessor
borrowed  $1.2  million  under  the line of  credit  in  April  1998 in order to
partially fund a $1.4 million distribution to stockholders of the Predecessor to
enable  them to pay taxes due on April 15,  1998 on account of  undistributed  S
corporation  taxable income.  The term loan bears interest at a rate of 8.5% per
annum and  matures on  December  1, 2001.  The  revolving  line of credit  bears
interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate and matures on May 30, 1998.

borrowings  under the revolving  line of credit and to repay the  Reorganization
Notes, a total of $6.0 million,  or 23.3%,  of the estimated net proceeds of the
Offering  will  be  received  by,  or  applied  for  the  benefit  of,  existing
stockholders  of the  Company.  The  remaining  net  proceeds  of the  Offering,
estimated to be  approximately  $11.4 million,  will be used for working capital
and  general  corporate  purposes,   which  may  include  capital  expenditures,
marketing  activities and strategic  acquisitions.  The Company currently has no
agreement or understanding with respect to any future acquisitions.  Pending the
use of the net proceeds, the Company will invest the net proceeds in short-term,

Product Development Expenses. The Company intends to use approximately 
$ 4,500,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering to significantly increase its 
investment in product development activities associated with the development of 
new products, including new products to be used on the Internet, the completion 
of the development of its ACID and VEGAS software products, and the continued 
enhancement of the Company's existing products, including enhancement of 
products for use on the Internet. The Company also expects to make expenditures 
for the licensing of technology, for the acquisition of additional software 
products, and for the hiring of additional, experienced, software engineers. 
Sales and Marketing Expenditures. The Company intends to use approximately 
$2,600,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering for the sale and marketing of 
the Company's existing and new products, including $1,600,000 for advertising 
and trade show related activities, $500,000 for expansion of the level of 
technical support offered to its dealers and customers and $500,000 for the 
opening of sales offices in several locations, including Europe and the eastern 
and western coasts of the United States. 

Facilities and Other Capital Expenditures. The Company intends to use 
approximately $700,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering to renovate a 
building adjacent to its principal facility for required expansion space. 
Additionally, the Company expects to use $700,000 of the net proceeds of the 
Offering to lease additional space for sales and administrative offices, and to 
invest in additional personal computers, networking systems, furniture, 
fixtures, leasehold improvements, and related equipment. See ""Business-- 
Facilities."" 

Repayment of Certain Indebtedness. The Company intends to use approximately 
$750,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay certain indebtedness of 
the Company. Such indebtedness consists of (i) a $620,000 term loan due January 
3, 2003, bearing interest at 7.71% per annum, and (ii) an equipment loan due 
February 2002, bearing interest at 9.75% per annum, of which $129,000 was 
outstanding on February 28, 1998. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital 
Resources."" 

Expansion of Internal Operations. The Company intends to use approximately 
$750,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering for expansion of internal 
operations, including further improvement of the Company's management 
information systems and the continued development of the Company's website. 

Working Capital and General Corporate Purposes. The Company intends to use the 
remainder of the net proceeds of the Offering for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Offering, based on the current state of its operations, its 
current plans and current economic conditions. Proceeds may be reapportioned 
among the categories listed above. The amount and timing of expenditures will 
vary depending upon a number of factors, including progress of the Company's 
operations, technical advances, terms of collaborative arrangements, and 
changes in competitive conditions. The Company also expects, when the 
opportunity arises, to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products 
or technologies. The Company has no present understandings, commitments or 
agreements with respect to any material acquisition or investment. 

The Company currently anticipates that the net proceeds of this Offering, along 
with cash provided by operations, will enable it to meet its operational and 
capital requirements for at least the 12 months following the date of this 
Prospectus. However, there can be no assurance that the net proceeds of this 
Offering and cash provided by operations will satisfy the Company's 
requirements for any particular period of time. To the extent capital resources 
are insufficient to meet future capital requirements, the Company will have to 
raise additional funds to satisfy the Company's requirements. There can be no 
assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. See 
""Risk Factors--Possible Need for Additional Financing."" 

Pending application of the net proceeds of the Offering, the Company intends to 
invest such net proceeds in interest-bearing, short-term investment grade 
financial instruments."

Bancorp (the ""Common Stock"") cannot be determined until the Offering is 
completed, it is presently anticipated that the net proceeds from the sale of 
the Common Stock will be between $85.3 million and $115.7 million (or $133.2 
million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%). See ""Pro Forma 
Data"" and ""The Reorganization and Offering--Stock Pricing and Number of Shares 
to Be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. Niagara 
Bancorp will be unable to utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offering until 
the consummation of the Reorganization. 

Niagara Bancorp will contribute approximately 50% of the net proceeds of the 
Offering to the Bank, or approximately $42.7 million to $66.6 million at the 
minimum and adjusted maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range, respectively. 
Such portion of net proceeds received by the Bank from Niagara Bancorp will be 
used by the Bank for general corporate purposes, including investments in short
- and medium-term, investment grade debt securities, mortgage related 
securities and marketable equity securities, and to increase the origination of 
mortgage, consumer and commercial business loans. The Bank may also use such 
funds for the continued expansion of its retail banking franchise, and to 
expand operations through acquisitions of other financial institutions, branch 
offices or other financial services companies. To the extent that the stock-
based benefit programs which Niagara Bancorp intends to adopt subsequent to the 
Offering are not funded with authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock of 
Niagara Bancorp, Niagara Bancorp or Bank may use net proceeds from the Offering 
to fund the purchase of stock to be awarded under such stock benefit programs. 
See ""Risk Factors--Possible Dilutive Effect of Issuance of Additional Shares"" 
and ""Management of the Bank--Benefit Plans--Stock Option Plan"" and ""-- 
Recognition and Retention Plan."" 

Niagara Bancorp intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains to make 
a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of the shares 
sold in the Offering. Based upon the sale of 8,677,747 shares or 11,740,482 
shares at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range, the amount 
of the loan to the ESOP would be $6.9 million or $9.4 million, respectively (or 
$10.8 million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%). See 
""Management of the Bank--Benefit Plans--Employee Stock Ownership Plan and 
Trust."" The remaining net proceeds retained by Niagara Bancorp will initially 
be invested in short- and medium-term debt obligations, mortgage related 
securities and other marketable equity securities. 

The net proceeds retained by Niagara Bancorp may also be used to support the 
future expansion of operations through the acquisition of financial 
institutions or their assets, including those located within the Bank's market 
area, or diversification into other banking related businesses. However, 
Niagara Bancorp and the Bank have no current arrangements, understandings or 
agreements regarding any such transactions. Upon completion of the 
Reorganization, Niagara Bancorp will be a bank holding company, and will be 
permitted to engage only in those activities that are permissible for bank 
holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the 
Federal Reserve Board. See ""Regulation -- Holding Company Regulation"" for a 
description of certain regulations applicable to Niagara Bancorp. 

Upon completion of the Reorganization, the board of directors of Niagara 
Bancorp will have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to 
statutory and regulatory requirements. Pursuant to New York regulations, and 
without the prior approval of the Department, Niagara Bancorp may not 
repurchase any Common Stock, in the first year after the Reorganization, and 
during each of the next two following years, may not repurchase more than 5% of 
its shares outstanding. In addition, the FDIC prohibits an insured savings bank 
which has converted from the mutual to stock form of ownership from 
repurchasing its capital stock within one year following the date of completion
 of its stock offering, except that stock repurchases of no greater than 5% of
 a bank's outstanding capital stock may be repurchased during this one-year 
period where compelling and valid business reasons are established to the 
satisfaction of the FDIC. Based upon facts and circumstances following 
completion of the Reorganization and subject to applicable regulatory 
requirements, the board of directors may determine to repurchase stock in the 
future. Such facts and circumstances may include but not be limited to: (i) 
market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in 
the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the 
investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of 
the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to improve Niagara 
Bancorp's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by 
not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or
 to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in 
which repurchases would be in the best interests of Niagara Bancorp and its 
stockholders. In the event Niagara Bancorp determines to repurchase stock, such 
repurchases may be made at market prices which may be in excess of the $10.00 
per share purchase price in the Offering (the ""Subscription Price""). Any stock 
repurchases will be subject to the determination of Niagara Bancorp's board of 
directors that both Niagara Bancorp and the Bank will be capitalized in excess 
of all applicable regulatory requirements after any repurchases and that such 
capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, the level of 
non-performing and other risk assets, Niagara Bancorp's and the Bank's current 
and projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic 
environment, tax and other considerations."

Stock offered hereby at the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share 
are estimated to be $29.9 million ($34.6 million if the Underwriters' over- 
allotment option is exercised in full). The Company will use the net proceeds 
as follows: (i) approximately $7.8 million will be used to redeem all the 
Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, including unpaid dividends; (ii) 
approximately $20.6 million will be used to repay outstanding indebtedness 
under the Company's revolving credit facility; and (iii) the balance of 
approximately $1.5 million will be used for general corporate purposes, 
including affiliations with additional dental group practices. The Company's 
$30 million revolving credit facility bears interest at either prime- or LIBOR-
based rates, at the Company's option, plus a margin based upon the Company's 
debt coverage ratio, which ranges up to 0.50% for prime-based loans and up to 
2.125% for LIBOR-based loans. At March 31, 1998, $20.6 million was outstanding 
under this credit facility at a prime-based rate of approximately 8.8%. The 
facility matures April 2000. To date, the proceeds from this revolving credit 
facility have been used for affiliations with dental practices. Pending the 
foregoing uses, the balance of the net proceeds will be invested in short-term, 
investment grade, interest bearing obligations. The Company anticipates that 
future affiliations will be completed using a combination of cash, subordinated 
promissory notes and Common Stock."

The expenses are estimated assuming that (a) all of the indicated number of
Common Shares are sold in the Subscription Offering; (b) the directors, officers
and their associates purchase 200,500 shares; (c) the ESOP purchases 8% of the
Common Shares sold; and (d) 60% of the Common Shares are sold to residents of
Boone County or Kenton County, Kentucky, 20% of the Common Shares are sold to
residents of counties contiguous to either Boone County or Kenton County,
Kentucky, and 20% of the Common Shares are sold to persons not residents of
Boone County or Kenton County, Kentucky, or any county contiguous to either of
such counties. Actual expenses may be more or less than estimated. See ""THE
CONVERSION - Plan of Distribution.""
         CFKY will retain 50% of the net proceeds from the sale of the Common
Shares, or $9,771,000 at the mid-point of the Valuation Range, including the
value of a promissory note from the ESOP which CFKY intends to accept in
exchange for the issuance of Common Shares to the ESOP. Such proceeds will be
used to fund the RRP and, initially, will be invested in short-term and
intermediate-term government securities. The remainder of the net proceeds
received from the sale of the Common Shares, $9,771,000 at the mid-point of the
Valuation Range, will be invested by CFKY in the capital stock to be issued by
Columbia Federal to CFKY as a result of the Conversion. Such investment will
increase the regulatory capital of Columbia Federal and will permit Columbia
Federal to expand its lending and investment activities and to enhance customer
services. Enhanced customer services may include the origination of additional
types of loans, including commercial loans and additional types of consumer
loans, such as home equity loans.
         Columbia Federal anticipates that such net proceeds initially will be
invested in mortgage-backed securities. Eventually, however, Columbia Federal
will attempt to use the net proceeds to originate and, if circumstances permit,
to purchase loans. Such use will be consistent with Columbia Federal's effort to
improve its interest rate risk position as well as increase its income. See ""THE
BUSINESS OF COLUMBIA FEDERAL - General."" See ""RISK FACTORS - Reduction in Return
on Equity Due to Proceeds of Offering.""
         Although CFKY and Columbia Federal could use the increase in capital to
acquire other financial institutions or for CFKY to repurchase its own
outstanding shares, CFKY and Columbia Federal have no current plans or
agreements, written or oral, and are not negotiating, to acquire any other
institution and have no current plans for CFKY to repurchase any of its shares."

estimated Offering expenses payable by the Company) from the sale of 2,600,000 
shares of Common Stock offered hereby at an initial public offering price of 
$14.50 per share are estimated to be approximately $33.8 million (approximately 
$40.8 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). 
The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering as follows: (i) an 
aggregate of $25.0 million to repay indebtedness consisting of $23.5 million 
principal amount outstanding under a $26.5 million credit facility with 
NationsCredit (the ""Credit Facility"") and $1.5 million principal amount 
outstanding under a note originally issued to Sirrom Capital Corporation 
(""Sirrom"") in connection with the NeoStar Medical(R)Acquisition (the ""Sirrom 
Note"") and presently owned by NationsCredit; (ii) an aggregate of $3.3 million 
to repay obligations relating to the NeoStar Medical(R) Acquisition consisting 
of $1.8 million payable in respect of non-compete agreements entered into with 
certain shareholders of NeoStar Medical(R) and $1.5 million principal 
outstanding under a promissory note issued to NeoStar Holding, Inc. (the 
""Acquisition Note""); and (iii) the balance of approximately $5.5 million for 
working capital and general corporate purposes including, among other things, 
the funding of acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or 
technologies, although the Company has no present commitments or agreements 
with respect to any additional material acquisitions, as well as the 
acquisition of certain additional office space in Atlanta, Georgia from an 
affiliated party. See ""Certain Transactions"" and Notes 6 and 11 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. 

Borrowings under the Credit Facility were used to finance the Strato(R)/
Infusaid(TM) Acquisition and to redeem warrants to purchase Common Stock issued 
to a former lender. Outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility bears 
interest at floating rates based on NationsCredit's Commercial Paper Rate plus 
4.25% to 5.25% (9.84% to 10.84% at December 31, 1997) and matures upon the 
earlier of the receipt by the Company of the proceeds from the Offering or July 
1, 2004. The Sirrom Note bears interest at a rate of 13.75% per annum and 
matures September 25, 2000. The Acquisition Note is a non-interest bearing note 
(other than a $37,235 portion thereof which bears interest at the prime rate 
plus 1%) with principal payments due monthly through June 30, 2000, and five 
payments due on various dates through October 31, 2003, all of which payments 
are due upon completion of the Offering. Pending use of the net proceeds as 
described above, the Company will invest the net proceeds in investment grade, 
interest-bearing securities. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the 
sale of Common Stock by the Selling Shareholders. As a result of the repayment 
of amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, pledges of shares of Common 
Stock by Messrs. Hunt, Peterson and Mallady will be terminated."

to range from $28.3 million to $38.5 million, or up to $44.4 million if the 
Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%. See ""PRO FORMA DATA"" for the 
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Holding Company has received 
conditional OTS approval to purchase all of the capital stock of the Savings 
Bank to be issued in the Conversion and Reorganization in exchange for 50% of 
the net proceeds of the Conversion Offerings. This will result in the Holding 
Company retaining approximately $14.2 million to $19.3 million of net proceeds, 
or up to $22.2 million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%, 
and the Savings Bank receiving an equal amount. See ""PRO FORMA DATA."" 

Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the Common Stock will 
increase the Savings Bank's capital and will support the expansion of the 
Savings Bank's existing business activities. The Savings Bank will use the 
funds contributed to it for general corporate purposes, including, initially, 
lending and investment in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations and 
mortgage-backed securities. 

The net proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially will be invested 
primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations and mortgage-
backed securities or in a deposit account either at the Savings Bank or another 
financial institution. Such proceeds will be available for additional 
contributions to the Savings Bank in the form of debt or equity, to support 
future diversification or acquisition activities, as a source of dividends to 
the stockholders of the Holding Company and for future repurchases of Common 
Stock to the extent permitted under Delaware law and federal regulations. The 
Holding Company will also use a portion of the net proceeds retained by it to 
refinance the ESOP's third party loan, which had an outstanding balance of 
$804,000 at September 30, 1997. See ""PRO FORMA DATA."" 
The Holding Company will consider exploring opportunities to use such funds to 
expand operations through acquiring or establishing additional branch offices 
or acquiring other financial institutions. In addition, the Holding Company may 
consider exploring opportunities to expand into non-traditional lines of 
business, such as securities brokerage, insurance agency and real estate 
development activities, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Currently, 
there are no specific plans, arrangements, agreements or understandings, 
written or oral, regarding any diversification activities. The Savings Bank, 
however, currently conducts real estate development activities through 
subsidiaries. See ""BUSINESS OF THE SAVINGS BANK -- Subsidiary Activities."" 

Following consummation of the Conversion and Reorganization, the Holding 
Company's Board of Directors will have the authority to adopt plans for 
repurchases of Common Stock, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Since the Holding Company has not yet issued stock, there currently is 
insufficient information upon which an intention to repurchase stock could be 
based. The facts and circumstances upon which the Board of Directors may 
determine to repurchase stock in the future would include but are not limited 
to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is 
trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other 
investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the 
investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of 
the remaining outstanding shares, and the ability to improve the Holding 
Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by 
not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or 
to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in 
which repurchases would be in the best interests of the Holding Company and its 
stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject to a determination by the 
Board of Directors that both the Holding Company and the Savings Bank will be 
capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such 
repurchases and that capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other 
things, the level of nonperforming and classified assets, the Holding Company's 
and the Savings Bank's current and projected results of operations and asset/
liability structure, the economic environment and tax and other regulatory 
considerations. For a discussion of the regulatory limitations applicable to 
stock repurchases and current OTS policy with respect thereto, see ""THE

 Placement, the Company plans to sell directly to Becton Dickinson, Hoechst

 $13.9 million for operational and capital expenditures, including facilities
 expansion, manufacturing scale-up and manufacturing and laboratory equipment;

marketing capabilities. The Company will use the balance of approximately
 $11.2 million of the net proceeds for working capital and other general
 corporate purposes. The cost, timing and amount of funds required by the
 Company cannot be precisely determined at this time and will be based upon
 numerous factors, including the following: the Company's progress in research
 and development; the results of clinical trials; the timing and costs of
 obtaining regulatory approvals; the ability of the Company to establish and
 receive payments under collaborative agreements; the costs involved in
 preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent
 claims; competing technological and market developments; changes in the
 Company's existing research relationships; evaluation of the commercial
 viability of potential products; effective commercialization activities and
 arrangements; and the cost and availability of alternative methods of

The Stock Company will contribute 50% of the net proceeds of the Offering to 
the Bank. Such portion of net proceeds received by the Bank from the Stock 
Company will be added to the Bank's general funds which the Bank currently 
intends to utilize for general corporate purposes, including investments in 
short- and medium-term investments. The Bank also intends to use such funds to 
increase its origination of mortgage, consumer and commercial business loans. 
The Bank may also use such funds for the expansion of its retail banking 
franchise, and to expand operations through acquisitions of other financial 
institutions, branch offices or other financial services companies. To the 
extent that the stock-based benefit programs which the Stock Company intends to 
adopt subsequent to the Offering are not funded with authorized but unissued 
shares of Common Stock, the Stock Company or Bank may use net proceeds from the 
Offering to fund the purchase of stock to be awarded under such stock benefit 
programs. See ""Risk Factors--Possible Dilutive Effect of Issuance of Additional 
Shares"" and ""Management of the Bank--Stock Option Plan"" and ""--Recognition 
Plan."" 

The Stock Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains to 
make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of the 
shares sold in the Offering. See ""Management of the Bank--Employee Stock 
Ownership Plan and Trust."" The remaining net proceeds retained by the Stock 
Company will be invested initially in short- and medium-term investments. 

The net proceeds retained by the Stock Company may also be used to support the 
future expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment 
of branch offices and the acquisition of financial institutions or their 
assets, or diversification into other banking related businesses. However, the 
Stock Company and the Bank have no current arrangements, understandings or 
agreements regarding any such transactions. Upon completion of the 
Reorganization, the Stock Company will be regulated as a mutual holding company 
under the Home Owners' Loan Act (the ""HOLA"") and regulations of the OTS. See 
""Regulation --Holding Company Regulation."" 

Upon completion of the Reorganization, the Board of Directors of the Stock 
Company will have the authority to repurchase stock, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Based upon facts and circumstances following the 
Reorganization and subject to applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of 
Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and 
circumstances may include but not be limited to (i) market and economic factors 
such as the price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of 
trading, the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the 
rate of return and risk involved in the investment, and the opportunity to 
improve the Stock Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the Stock 
Company and its shareholders. In the event the Stock Company determines to 
repurchases stock, such repurchases may be made at market prices which may be 
in excess of the Subscription Price in the Offering. To the extent that the 
Stock Company repurchases stock at market prices in excess of the per share 
book value, such repurchases may have a dilutive effect upon stockholders' 
equity per share of Common Stock."

 be determined until the Offering is completed, it is presently anticipated that
 the net proceeds will be between $151.1 million and $205.1 million (or $236.1 
million if the Offering Range is increased by 15%), based upon the assumptions 
set forth in ""Pro Forma Data."" The Company will be unable to utilize any of the
 net proceeds of the Offering until the consummation of the Conversion. 
The Company will contribute to the Bank 50% of the net proceeds of the Offering,
 which will be added to the Bank's general funds that management currently intends 
to initially utilize for general corporate purposes, 
including investment in one- to four-family residential real estate loans and 
other loans and investment in short-term and intermediate-term securities and mortgage-backed securities. The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to loan funds to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 4% of the Subscription Shares issued in the Offering. To the extent the 1998 Recognition Plan is not funded with authorized but unissued Common Stock, the Company or Bank may use net proceeds from the Offering to fund the purchase of stock to be awarded under such plan. See ""Management of the Bank--Benefit Plans."" 
Net Offering Proceeds, including proceeds retained by the Company and proceeds
 contributed to the Bank, may also used to support the future expansion of 
operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment of new branch offices,
 and the acquisition of other financial institutions or diversification into 
other banking related businesses. The Bank has acquired two financial institutions 
since September 30, 1996, and the Company and the Bank continue to actively
 explore additional acquisition opportunities, engage in discussions or negotiations 
regarding possible acquisitions, and conduct business investigations of prospective 
target institutions. Neither the Company nor the Bank has any specific agreements 
or understandings regarding any additional acquisitions at this time. 
Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company will
 have the authority to repurchase stock, subject to statutory and regulatory 
requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, the Company, pursuant to OTS policy, 
will be prohibited from repurchasing any shares of Common Stock for three years
 except (i) for an offer to all stockholders on a pro rata basis, or 
(ii) for the repurchase of qualifying shares of a director. Notwithstanding the
 foregoing and except as provided below, beginning one year following completion
 of the Conversion, the Company may repurchase Common Stock so long as: (i) the
 repurchases within the following two years are part of an open-market program 
not involving greater than 5% of its outstanding capital stock during a twelve-
month period; (ii) the repurchases do not cause the Bank to become 
""undercapitalized"" within the meaning of the OTS prompt corrective action
 regulation; and (iii) the Company provides to the Regional Director of the OTS
 no later than ten days prior to the commencement of a repurchase program 
written notice containing a full description of the program to be undertaken and
 such program is not disapproved by the Regional Director. However, the Regional
 Director has authority to permit repurchases during the first year following 
consummation of the Conversion and to permit repurchases in excess of 5% during
 the second and third years upon the establishment of exceptional circumstances,
 as determined by the Regional Director. 
Based upon facts and circumstances following the Conversion and subject to 
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to
 repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but
 will not be limited to (i) market and economic factors such as the price at
 which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness 
of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk 
involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or 
earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to
 improve the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of
 stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders. In the event the Company determines to repurchase stock,
 such repurchases may be made at market prices which may be in excess of the
 Subscription Price in the Offering. To the extent that the Company repurchases
 stock at market prices in excess of the per share book value, such repurchases
 may have a dilutive effect upon the interests of existing stockholders."

The Company is also conducting the Offering to create a market for its Common 
Stock, to facilitate future access by the Company to the public equity markets 
and to enhance the Company's public image and credibility to support its 
marketing efforts. 

The CASI Note is non-interest bearing and is due and payable on February 28, 
1998, or the closing of the Offering, whichever is sooner. Until March 9, 1998, 
David Tobey, a director of the Company, was the President, Chief Executive 
Officer and a significant stockholder of CASI and an employee of CASI's parent 
Datatec. The Datatec Note bears interest at the rate of 10% per annum, and is 
required to be repaid on February 28, 1998, or the closing of the Offering, 
whichever is sooner. The Bridge Notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum 
and are payable upon the earlier of the closing of the Offering or 18 months 
from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 1997 (excluding interest), the 
balance of the CASI Note was $700,000, the balance of the Datatec Note was 
$100,000 and the aggregate balance of the Bridge Notes was $400,000. 

The Company believes that the proceeds of the Offering, funds from operations 
and available lines of credit will be sufficient to support the Company's 
capital needs for the next 12 months. The Company intends to maintain 
flexibility in the use of the proceeds of the Offering (other than amounts to 
retire the Bridge Notes, the Datatec Note and the CASI Note). The amounts 
actually expended for each use of the proceeds, if any, are at the discretion 
of the Company and may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, 
including requirements for launching new product lines, marketing, advertising 
and working capital to support growth. Accordingly, management reserves the 
right to reallocate the proceeds of the Offering as it deems appropriate. The 
Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, 
products or proprietary rights, or to enter into joint ventures; however, the 
Company currently has no commitments or agreements relating to any of these 
types of transactions other than those disclosed in this Prospectus. Until the 
net proceeds of the Offering are used, the Company intends to invest them in 
United States government securities, short-term certificates of deposit, money 
market funds or other short-term interest bearing investments."

 to range from $43.5 million to $59.1 million, or up to $68.1 million if the
 Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%. See ""PRO FORMA DATA"" for the
 assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Holding Company has received
 conditional OTS approval to purchase all of the capital stock of the 
Association to be issued in the conversion in exchange for 50% of the net 
proceeds of the conversion. This will result in the Holding Company retaining
 approximately $21.8 million to $29.5 million of net proceeds, or up to $34.1 
million if the Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%, and the
 Association receiving an equal amount. 

Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the common stock will 
increase the Association's capital and will support the expansion of the 
Association's existing business activities. The Association will use the funds 
contributed to it for general corporate purposes, including, initially, lending
 and investment in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. Depending
 on loan demand, the Association may consider using a portion of the conversion
 proceeds for investment in mortgage-backed securities. 

In connection with the conversion and the establishment of the ESOP, the 
Holding Company intends to loan the ESOP the amount necessary to purchase 8% of
 the shares of common stock sold in the conversion. The Holding Company's loan 
to fund the ESOP may range from $3,570,000 to $4,830,000 based on the sale of
 238,000 shares to the ESOP (at the minimum of the Estimated Valuation Range)
 and 322,000 shares (at the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range), 
respectively, at $15.00 per share. If 15% above the maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range, or 4,628,750 shares, are sold in the conversion, the Holding 
Company's loan to the ESOP would be approximately $5,554,500 (based on the sale
 of 370,300 shares to the ESOP). It is anticipated that the ESOP loan will have
 a 15-year term with interest payable at the prime rate as published in The 
Wall Street Journal on the closing date of the conversion. The loan will be 
repaid principally from the Association's contributions to the ESOP and from
 any dividends paid on shares of common stock held by the ESOP. 

The remaining net proceeds retained by the Holding Company initially will be 
invested primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. Such
 proceeds will be available for additional contributions to the Association in
 the form of debt or equity, to support future diversification or acquisition 
activities, as a source of dividends to the stockholders of the Holding Company
 and for future repurchases of common stock to the extent permitted under 
Delaware law and federal regulations. The Holding Company will consider 
exploring opportunities to use such funds to expand operations through 
acquiring or establishing additional branch offices or acquiring other 
financial institutions. Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements, 
agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding any expansion 
activities. 

Following consummation of the conversion, the Board of Directors will have the
 authority to adopt plans for repurchases of common stock, subject to statutory
 and regulatory requirements. Since the Holding Company has not yet issued
 stock, there currently is insufficient information upon which an intention to
 repurchase stock could be based. The facts and circumstances upon which the 
Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future would
 include but are not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the 
price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the 
attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return
 and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value
 and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the ability
 to improve the Holding Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of
 dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the
 exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and 
(iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best 
interests of the Holding Company and its stockholders. Any stock repurchases
 will be subject to a determination by the Board of Directors that both the
 Holding Company and the Association will be capitalized in excess of all
 applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that capital
 will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, the Association's 
level of nonperforming and classified assets, the Holding Company's and the 
Association's current and projected results of operations and asset/liability
 structure, the economic environment and tax and other regulatory considerations

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that
the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $43.3 million
and $58.8 million (or $67.8 million if the Estimated Price Range is increased by
15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion - Stock Pricing"" as to the
assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Company will be unable to
utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offerings until the consummation of the
Conversion.
    The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank
to be issued upon Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the
Offerings. Based on net proceeds of $43.3 million to $58.8 million, the Company
expects to utilize between $21.6 million and $29.4 million of net proceeds to
purchase the common stock of the Bank. Such portion of net proceeds received by
the Bank from the Company will be added to the Bank's general funds which the
Bank currently intends to utilize for general corporate purposes, including
investment in loans and securities. The Bank may also use such funds for the
expansion of its facilities, including the construction of a new branch in 1998,
and to expand operations through acquisitions of other financial institutions,
branch offices or other financial services companies within the Bank's primary
market area. To the extent that the stock-based benefit programs which the
Company or the Bank intend to adopt subsequent to the Conversion are not funded
with authorized but unissued common stock of the Company, the Company or Bank
may use net proceeds from the Conversion to fund the purchase of stock to be
awarded under such stock benefit programs. See ""Risk Factors--Stock-Based
Benefits to Management, Employment Contracts and Change in Control Payments"" and
""Management of the Bank--Benefit Plans -Stock Option Plan"" and ""--Stock
Program.""
    The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds it retains (i.e.,
50% of the net proceeds, which based on net proceeds of $43.3 million to $58.8
million will be between $21.6 million and $29.4 million) to make a loan directly
to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase in the Conversion, or in the open
market to the extent Common Stock is not available to fill the ESOP's
subscription, 8% of the Common Stock issued in connection with the Conversion,
including shares issued to the Foundation. Based upon the sale of 4,458,250
shares or 6,031,750 shares at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated Price
Range, and the issuance of shares to the Foundation, the amount of the loan to
the ESOP would be $3.9 million or $5.2 million, respectively (or $6.0 million if
the Estimated Price Range is increased by 15%), with a term of 15 years at the
prevailing prime rate of interest, which currently is 8.5%. The Company and Bank
may alternatively choose to fund the ESOP's stock purchases through a loan by a
third party financial institution. See ""Management of the Bank--Benefit
Plans--ESOP."" The remaining net proceeds retained by the Company will initially
be invested in mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities and other
investment grade marketable securities.
    The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the
future expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment of
branch offices and the acquisition of savings associations and commercial banks
or their assets, including those located within the Bank's market area or
diversification into other banking related businesses. The Company and the Bank
have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding any such
transactions. The Company, upon the Conversion, will be a unitary savings and
loan holding company, which under existing laws would not be restricted as to
the types of business activities in which it may engage. See ""Regulation and
Supervision-- Holding Company Regulation"" for a description of certain
regulations applicable to the Company.
    Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company
will have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory
and regulatory requirements. Unless previously approved, the Company,
pursuant to applicable regulations, may not repurchase any Common Stock in
the first year after conversion. If approval is obtained to repurchase common
stock during the first year after conversion, then such repurchase may not be
greater than 5% of the capital stock issued. Further, the Company may not
repurchase any of its Common Stock if the repurchases would cause the Bank to
become ""undercapitalized"" within the meaning of the FDIC prompt corrective
action regulation. See ""Regulation and Supervision -Prompt Corrective
Regulatory Action."" In addition, the FDIC prohibits an insured mutual state
savings bank which has converted from the mutual to stock form of ownership
from repurchasing its capital stock within one year following the date of its
conversion to stock form, except that stock repurchases of no greater than 5%
of a bank's outstanding capital stock may be repurchased during this one-year
period where compelling and valid business reasons are established to the
satisfaction of the FDIC.
    Based upon facts and circumstances following the Conversion and subject to
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but not
be limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the
stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of
other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved
in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per
share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to improve the
Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by
not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or
to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which
repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
In the event the Company determines to repurchase stock, such repurchases may be
made at market prices which may be in excess of the Purchase Price in the
Conversion. To the extent that the Company repurchases stock at market prices in
excess of the Purchase Price in the Conversion, such repurchases may have a
dilutive effect upon the interests of existing stockholders. Any stock
repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of Directors that
both the Company and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable
regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that such capital will be
adequate, taking into account, among other things, the level of non-performing

of which $878,000 was incurred on January 7, 1998 in connection with the 
purchase of the Cavanaughs on the Falls hotel. Any remaining proceeds will be 
used by the Company for future investments in, or acquisitions of, hotel

repaid with the net proceeds of the Offering, an aggregate of approximately 
$1.5 million will be used by the Company to repay a note payable to Inland 
Northwest Corporation, an entity owned by certain members of the Barbieri 
Family, in the amount of $933,000 and an obligation owed to the Barbieri Family 
Foundation, Inc. in the amount of $600,000. Pending such uses, the Company 
intends to invest the net proceeds in short- term investment grade, interest-
bearing securities, certificates of deposit or guaranteed obligations of the 
United States of America. At December 31, 1997 the indebtedness to be repaid 
bore interest at fixed and variable rates, with a weighted average annual rate 
of 8.8% and a weighted average remaining maturity of six years and six months.

Stock offered by the Company hereby (after deducting underwriting discounts and
 commissions and estimated Offering expenses payable by the Company) are 
approximately $59.2 million ($68.1 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment
 options are exercised in full). 

The Company intends to use approximately: (i) $33.3 million to repay the 
Company's indebtedness to Zapata outstanding as of December 31, 1997 and (ii)
 $2.1 million to repay bank indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 1997.
 Of the $33.3 million of intercompany indebtedness to be repaid to Zapata,
 $28.1 million was incurred to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for
 the Recent Acquisitions and the balance was primarily incurred to pay the
 Company's federal income taxes. The Zapata intercompany indebtedness incurred
 in connection with the Recent Acquisitions bears interest at 8.5% per annum
 and matures in November 2002. The balance of the intercompany indebtedness
 does not bear interest. The $2.1 million of bank indebtedness was incurred to
 fund working capital needs, bears interest at the bank's prime rate or LIBOR
 plus 175 basis points, at the Company's election, and matures in August 2002.
 See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
 of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources.' Management of the Company
 will have broad discretion concerning the allocation and use of the net
 proceeds of this Offering remaining after the repayment of indebtedness
 described above. Management intends to apply these remaining net proceeds to
 general corporate purposes, including working capital and future acquisitions.
 Although the Company is currently evaluating various acquisition 
opportunities, the Company has no current or pending plans, agreements, 
understandings, negotiations or arrangements with respect to any material
 acquisition. In addition to repaying indebtedness, the Company's primary 
purposes in conducting this Offering are to obtain additional equity capital,
 create a public market for the Common Stock, facilitate future access to the
 public equity markets and provide increased visibility for the Company. 

Pending application of the net proceeds to the Company from the Offering, the
 Company intends to invest such net proceeds in interest-bearing, short-term,
 investment grade securities or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. 

The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Common
 Stock by the Selling Stockholder."

(1) The Company plans to open five new retail stores during the 24 months 
following the Effective Date at an estimated cost of $650,000 per store, or 
$3,250,000 in the aggregate. The estimated cost of opening each new store 
includes the cost of leasehold improvements, including design and decoration, 
machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, security deposits, opening 
inventory (net of the portion to be borrowed from the Company's lender), lease 
acquisition expenses, preopening expenses, and 
additional advertising and promotion in connection with the opening. Instead of 
leasing and developing a new location, the Company may acquire the business of 
an existing consumer electronics retailer, although no agreements have been 
reached with any such company, and no such negotiations are pending. 

(2) Possible working capital uses include inventory, advertising and other 
ongoing selling, general and administrative expenses, to be determined by the 
Company's executive officers based upon their assessment of the Company's 
needs. 

The amounts and timing of these expenditures may vary depending upon numerous 
factors including the ability of the Company to locate suitable premises or to 
enter into acceptable leases for the opening of new retail facilities. The 
foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of this Offering, based on both the expected utilization of funds 
necessary to finance the Company's existing activities and the Company's 
current objectives, as well as current economic conditions. The Company may 
from time to time reallocate funds among the uses discussed above or to new 
uses if it believes such reallocation to be in its best interests. 

Prior to the opening or acquisition of new stores, the net proceeds may be used 
to paydown (in full or in part) the Company's outstanding obligations under its 
revolving line of credit facility which permits repayment and reborrowing of 
funds from time to time. It is the Company's intention to re-borrow any portion 
of the credit facility which is paid down as the Company requires the funds. 
Any portion not so used will be invested in short-term money market instruments 
or direct U.S. Government obligations. 

Any proceeds from the exercise of the Warrants and/or the Over-Allotment Option 
and any income from investments will be included in the Company's working 
capital and used for general corporate purposes. 

The Company expects that cash flow from operations, together with the net 
proceeds of this Offering and amounts available under its revolving credit 
facility, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the twenty-four 
month period immediately following the consummation of the Offering."
NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA FINANCIAL CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/northeast-pennsylvania-financial-corp-4701-9809,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/northeast-pennsylvania-financial-corp-4701-9809,424B3,2/24/1998,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=214241,"Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock cannot
be determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated
that the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be between $37.1
million and $50.4 million (or $58.1 million if the Estimated Price Range is
increased by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion -- Stock Pricing"" as
to the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. The Company will be unable to
utilize any of the net proceeds of the Offerings until the consummation of the
Conversion.
 
     The Company will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank
to be issued upon Conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds, with the
remaining net proceeds to be retained by the Company. Based on the midpoint of
the Estimated Price Range, the Company expects to utilize the $21.9 million of
net proceeds to purchase the common stock of the Bank. Such portion of net
proceeds will be added to the Bank's general funds which the Bank currently
intends to utilize for general corporate purposes, including investments in
loans, mortgage-related and investment securities, the possible repayment of
FHLB advances under appropriate market conditions, and the funding of
stock-based benefit plans. The Bank may also use such funds for the expansion of
its facilities, and to expand operations through acquisitions of other financial
institutions, branch offices or other financial services companies. The Bank has
not yet determined the approximate amount of net proceeds to be used for any of
the purposes mentioned above.
 
     The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to make a loan
directly to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to purchase 8% of the Common Stock
issued in the Conversion, including shares issued to the Foundation. The Company
and Bank may alternatively choose to fund the ESOP's stock purchases through a
loan by a third-party financial institution. The remaining net proceeds retained
by the Company will initially be invested in mortgage-related securities and
federal agency obligations. Based upon the sale of 3,825,000 shares or 5,175,000
shares at the minimum and maximum of the Estimated Price Range, and the issuance
of shares to the Foundation, the amount of the loan to the ESOP would be $3.3
million or $4.5 million, respectively (or $5.1 million if the Estimated Price
Range is increased by 15%) to be repaid over a 10-year period at the prevailing
prime rate of interest, which currently is 8.5%. See ""Management of the Bank --
Other Benefit Plans -- Employee Stock Ownership Plan.""
 
     The net proceeds retained by the Company may also be used to support the
future expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment of
branch offices and the acquisition of other financial institutions or their
assets, including those located within the Bank's market area or diversification
into other banking related businesses. The Company has no current arrangements,
understandings or agreements regarding any such opportunities or transactions.
The Company, upon the Conversion, will be a unitary savings and loan holding
company, which under existing laws would generally not be restricted as to the
types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that the Bank
continues to be a qualified thrift lender (""QTL""). See ""Regulation -- Holding
Company Regulation"" for a description of certain regulations applicable to the
Company.
 
     Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors of the Company
will have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory
and regulatory requirements. Unless approved by the OTS, the Company, pursuant
to OTS regulations, will be prohibited from repurchasing any shares of the
Common Stock for three years except (i) for an offer to all stockholders on a
pro rata basis, or (ii) for the repurchase of qualifying shares of a director.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided below, beginning one year
following completion of the Conversion, the OTS regulations permit the Company
to repurchase its Common Stock so long as: (i) the repurchases within the
following two years are part of an open-market program not involving greater
than 5% of its outstanding capital stock during a 12-month period; (ii) the
repurchases do not cause the Bank to become ""undercapitalized"" within the
meaning of the OTS prompt corrective action regulation; and (iii) the Company
provides to the Regional Director of the OTS no later than 10 days prior to the
commencement of a repurchase program written notice containing a full
description of the program to be undertaken and such program is not disapproved
by the Regional Director. See ""Regulation -- Prompt Corrective Regulatory
Action."" In addition, under current OTS policies, repurchases may be allowed in
the first year following Conversion and in amounts greater than 5% in the second
and third years following
Conversion provided there are valid and compelling business reasons for such
repurchases and the OTS does not object to such repurchases.
 
     Based upon facts and circumstances following Conversion and subject to
applicable regulatory requirements, the Board of Directors may determine to
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but are
not limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the
stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of
other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved
in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per
share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to improve the
Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by
not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or
to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which
repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Although the Company has no current plans to repurchase its stock, in the event
the Company does determine to repurchase stock, such repurchases may be made at
market prices which may be in excess of the Purchase Price in the Conversion.
 
     Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of
Directors that both the Company and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of
all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that such
capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, the level of
non-performing and other risk assets, the Company's and the Bank's current and
projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic
environment, tax and other considerations. See ""The Conversion -- Certain
Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After Conversion.""
 
     Additionally, in connection with the Conversion, the Company and Bank have
committed to the OTS that during the one-year period following the consummation
of the Conversion, the Company will not make any distribution to stockholders
that, for federal tax purposes, would be treated as a return of capital without
prior approval of the OTS."

The Company intends to use an estimated $4,400,000 of the net proceeds of the 
Offering to expand its sales and marketing efforts. Of this amount, 
approximately $3,200,000 is expected to be used to increase brand awareness of 
the Company's products through implementation of a comprehensive advertising 
and public relations campaign and increased expenditures on trade shows, and 
the remaining $1,200,000 is expected to be used for hiring of additional 
marketing and technical sales personnel and wages and benefits for current 
sales and marketing personnel. The additional marketing and technical personnel 
are expected to support the Company's sales and marketing efforts in industries 
where the Company's products are currently being marketed (including apparel, 
footwear and sporting goods products), as well as its near term (including home 
furnishings, shipping and packaging, and healthcare) and long term (including 
automotive, aerospace, and computers and electronics) target industries. The 
additional amounts allocated to trade show participation will be used to design 
and construct trade show displays that can be adapted for use in each of the 
industries in which the Company currently competes. See ""Business -- Strategy"" 
and ""--Sales and Marketing."" 

The Company intends to use an estimated $2,400,000 of the net proceeds of the 
Offering for product 
development for current and potential customers and strategic partners, 
including the development of additional and improved end-use products to be 
sold by strategic partners utilizing the Company's Thermasorb(R) and ComforTemp
(R) products and the establishment of customer and technical support service 
teams. See ""Business -- Product Development Services and Support."" 

The Company intends to use approximately $600,000 of the net proceeds of the 
Offering to fund capital expenditures necessary to support the sales and 
marketing, research and development, improved quality control and product 
development expansion described above, including but not limited to, the 
acquisition of certain testing and analysis equipment for use in connection 
with the Company's product development, research and development and improved 
quality assurance efforts. 

To date, the Company has funded its research and development efforts (and 
anticipates that it will continue to fund the majority of such efforts) through 
funding obtained from government and related private sources. Accordingly, the 
Company intends to use an estimated $200,000 of the net proceeds of the 
Offering for research and development, including, hiring additional technical 
personnel and developing new products and technologies. In the event the 
Company is unable to obtain government or private industry funding for research 
and development, the Company will be required to pay any future research and 
development costs from its own resources which would increase the amount of net 
proceeds allocated to research and development efforts thereafter. See 
""Business -- Research and Development."" 

The balance of the net proceeds of approximately $1,544,000 ($3,010,000 if the 
Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full), will be employed for working 
capital, including hiring other management personnel. The Company may also from 
time to time utilize a portion of such proceeds to acquire or enter into 
licensing arrangements with respect to complementary businesses, products, 
services or technologies. 



The table above represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
uses of the net proceeds of the Offering based upon the current state of its 
business operations, its current business plan and strategy, and current 
economic and industry conditions. The amount and timing of expenditures will 
vary depending upon a number of factors, including, among other things, the 
progress of the Company's product development and marketing efforts, changing 
competitive conditions and general economic conditions. The allocation of the 
net proceeds of the Offering is subject to reapportionment among the purposes 
listed above. Management has broad discretion as to the actual allocation of 
the net proceeds. The actual allocation of the net proceeds cannot be predicted 
with any degree of certainty. See ""Risk Factors -- Broad Discretion as to Use 
of Proceeds."" 
Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends 
to invest the net proceeds of the Offering in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade debt securities, money market accounts, certificates of 
deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States government."

(1) Includes the purchase of skate components, finished product assemblies and 
short term warehousing for distribution to the United States. 
(2) The terms of the 1997 Loan provide that $600,000 of such loan is to be 
repaid upon consummation of this offering. The 1997 Loan bears interest at 12% 
per annum. The proceeds of the 1997 Loan were used for inventory purchases, to 
pay costs of this offering and general corporate purposes. 

(3) The terms of the Bridge Notes provide for repayment in full of all 
principal and interest upon consummation of this offering. The Bridge Notes 
bore interest at 12% per annum. As of October 31, 1997 the Bridge Notes were in 
default and are entitled to an additional 6% of interest for a total interest 
rate of 18% per annum. The amount noted includes interest owed through March 
31, 1998. The proceeds of the issuance of the Bridge Notes were utilized for 
inventory purchases, costs of this offering and general corporate purposes. 

(4) The Company will repay $175,000 of loans from stockholders and former 
officers and directors of the Company. The loans are due upon demand and bear 
interest at 12% per annum. The proceeds of the loans were used for working 
capital. See ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."" 

(5) At the closing of this offering, $122,000 will be paid to Mr. Forcelledo 
for payment of accrued salary to the date of this Prospectus. Mr. Forcelledo 
has agreed to waive the payment of $106,000 of the total accrued salary of 
$228,000 otherwise payable to him. See ""Management -- Employment Agreements."" 

(6) Includes the development and completion of the Company's administrative and 
operational infrastructure, selling, general and administrative expenses and 
other general corporate purposes. Includes the payment of $72,000 to a creditor 
of the Company. See ""Legal Proceedings."" These funds may also be utilized to 
pay officer's salaries. 

Of the $587,000 of offering expenses, the Company has previously paid 
approximately $190,000. 

The above amounts and priorities for the use of proceeds represent 
management's estimates based upon current operating plans and certain strategic 
assumptions, including those relating to the Company's future revenue levels 
and expenditures, and assumptions regarding industry and general economic and 
other conditions. Although the Company does not contemplate any changes in the 
proposed use of proceeds, to the extent the Company finds that adjustment is 
required to the use of proceeds of this offering, the amounts shown may be 
adjusted among the uses indicated above, or certain portions of the net 
proceeds may be used for other purposes. Such shifts will be at the discretion 
of the Company. Any material changes in the use of proceeds by the Company will 
be reported by the Company in its Exchange Act reports. In the event the 
Company is able to obtain a credit line for inventory purchases, the Company 
may utilize all or some of the proceeds allocated above for inventory purchases 
for additional marketing, advertising and working capital. The Company reserves 
the right to enter into short term borrowing in the future as business 
conditions or the Company's needs may require. 
Included in the estimated offering expenses are approximately $90,000 of 
expenses which were paid from the proceeds of the 1997 Loan and 1997 Bridge 
Offering. 

The Company anticipates that it will commence the application of the proceeds 
upon completion of this offering and that such proceeds will be applied over 
the next twelve months. The Company believes that the net proceeds of this 
offering will be sufficient to satisfy its requirements to implement its 
business plans over such period. 

To the extent the over-allotment option is exercised, any proceeds from such 
exercise will be used for working capital. 

The Company will not derive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling 
Stockholder Shares by the Selling Stockholders, although it will receive the 
exercise price of the 1996 Warrants in the event a 1996 Warrant is exercised by 
a Selling Stockholder. In the event that all of the 247,936 1996 Warrants are 
exercised, the Company will receive $1,239,680 of proceeds. Any proceeds 
received from the exercise of 1996 Warrants will be used for working capital 
purposes. Additionally, in the event that all of the Agent Warrants are 
exercised, the Company will receive $137,973, which proceeds will be used for 
working capital purposes. 

Pending the use of the offering proceeds, the net proceeds of this offering 
will be invested in short-term interest-bearing deposits or United States 
government securities."

offered hereby are estimated to be approximately $10.4 million ($12.1 million if
the Underwriters' over-allotment option is fully exercised).
     The primary purpose of this offering is to provide additional capital
required to support the Company's continued growth and expansion. The Company
intends to use approximately $3.5 million to purchase additional inventory of
aircraft components and spare parts, including JT9 or CF6 engines in connection
with the Company's entry into the wide-body aircraft market. An additional $3.1
million will be used to repay indebtedness owed, and S Corporation distributions
payable, to the Existing Common Stockholders. Advances from the Existing Common
Stockholders, which totalled approximately $650,000 at April 30, 1998, bear
interest at rates between 6% and 8% per annum, are unsecured and mature on or
prior to June 30, 1998. See ""S Corporation Distributions"" for further
information concerning amounts to be distributed to the Existing Common
Stockholders in connection with the termination of the Company's S Corporation
status. An additional $3.0 million will be used to repay a portion of
indebtedness expected to be outstanding under a $10.0 million credit facility
maturing in September 1998 (the ""Credit Facility"") with NationsBank, N.A.
(""NationsBank""), which currently bears interest at the London Interbank Offered
Rate (""LIBOR"") plus an amount between 1.75% to 2.25%.
     The balance of the net proceeds of this offering, or $1.1 million, together
with available borrowings under the Credit Facility, will be used to purchase
aircraft and engines for disassembly, sale or lease, to increase the Company's
inventory of aircraft components and spare parts, to fund strategic acquisitions
and for other working capital needs. The Company intends to use an undetermined
portion of the net proceeds of this offering and available borrowings to pursue
strategic acquisitions of FAA-licensed repair facilities, aircraft component and
spare part redistributors, and small manufacturers of aviation products.
Although the Company has identified a number of companies engaged in these
activities, the Company has no agreements, understandings or commitments with
respect to any acquisitions and there can be no assurance that any acquisitions
will be completed. Amounts allocated to working capital will also be used to
fund additional marketing activities, for the hiring of additional customer
support personnel and to hire additional personnel experienced in avionics and
instrumentation as the Company executes its strategy of expanding in this market
segment. See ""Business -- Business Strategy.""
     The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the use of the net
proceeds to be received in this offering, based on current planning and business
conditions. However, the Company reserves the right to change such uses when and
if market conditions or unexpected changes in operating conditions or results of
operations occur. The amounts actually expended for each use may vary
significantly depending upon a number of factors including, but not limited to,
future growth and the amount of cash generated by the Company's operations. The
Company believes that its existing capital resources and the net proceeds of
this offering will be sufficient to maintain its current and planned operations
for a period of at least 18 months from the date of this Prospectus. Net
proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be
invested principally in U.S. government securities, short-term certificates of
deposit, money market funds or other short-term, interest-bearing securities."

$33,556,500 ($39,178,350 if the Underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full), at an assumed initial public offering price of $13.00 per
share (the mid-point of the range set forth on the cover of this Prospectus)
and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
Offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company will use a portion of
the net proceeds to repay $7.5 million borrowed under its credit facility, as
amended (the ""Credit Facility"") with BankBoston, N.A. (""BankBoston""), which as
of April 3, 1998 bears interest at a weighted average rate of 8.5% per annum.
The Company's borrowings under the Credit Facility were used for acquisitions.
The Credit Facility expires on November 7, 2000. The Company will also use
$3.75 million of the net proceeds to retire a portion of a short-term
promissory note, currently bearing interest at the rate of 12.0% per annum,
issued to the sole stockholder of the Hackett Group in connection with the
Company's acquisition of that entity. The Company will also repay $2,582,500
in short-term notes, bearing interest at the rate of 6.0% per annum, payable
to the stockholders of Legacy Technology, Inc. (""Legacy"") which were issued in
connection with the Legacy Acquisition. The balance of the net proceeds, or
approximately $19,724,000, will be used for working capital, potential
acquisitions and general corporate purposes. The Company does not currently
have any agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to any future
acquisitions, and no portion of the net proceeds has been allocated for any
specific acquisition. Pending their use as described in this Prospectus, the
net proceeds of the Offering will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities. The Company will not receive any proceeds from
the sale of shares of Common Stock by the Selling Shareholders. See

(1) Includes acquiring necessary equipment and recruiting qualified personnel. 
(2) The Company will use approximately $350,000 of such net proceeds to repay 
certain guaranteed consulting payments of $50,000 per quarter through December 
1999. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

(3) The Company's management, subject to approval by the Board of Directors, 
will have broad discretion with respect to the proceeds designated for working 
capital and general corporate purposes. The Company feels that such discretion 
is necessary to allow management to determine the best allocation, as 
particular needs arise, of such proceeds. The Company may also use a portion of 
such proceeds to acquire or license technology rights or compounds. No such 
transactions involving a material amount of consideration are being negotiated 
as of the date of this prospectus. Pending application of such proceeds, the 
net proceeds to the Company of the Offering will be invested in short-term, 
interest bearing, investment grade securities. See ""Risk Factors -- Management's
Discretion as to Use of Proceeds."" 

The Company anticipates that the net proceeds of the Offering, together with 
the proceeds from the sale of the Abbott Shares, and the interest income earned 
on such proceeds, together with existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
investments, will be sufficient for the purposes specified herein and to allow 
the Company to maintain its current and planned operations through the first 
quarter of 2000. However, there can be no assurance that the Company's 
assumptions regarding future operating losses and operating expenses will be 
accurate. The Company's future funding requirements and use of proceeds will 
depend on many factors, including: any expansion or acceleration and the 
breadth of the Company's research and development programs; the results of 
research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by 
the Company or its collaborative partners or licensees, if any; the acquisition
 or licensing of technologies or compounds, if any; the Company's ability to 
maintain existing and establish new corporate relationships and research 
collaborations; the Company's ability to manage growth; competing technological 
and market developments; the time and costs involved in filing, prosecuting, 
defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims; the receipt of 
licensing or milestone fees from its current or future collaborative and 
license arrangements, if established; the continued funding of governmental 
research grants; the timing of regulatory approvals; and other factors. The 
Company will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its 
operations. Initially, the Company intends to seek such additional funding 
through collaborative arrangements and through public or private financings, 
including equity or debt financings. See ""Risk Factors -- Need for Additional 
Capital; Uncertainty of Additional Funding"" and ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."""

(1) The Company will borrow $150.0 million from Chancellor Media pursuant to 
the Chancellor Exchange Agreement, which the Company will use to finance in 
part the SFX Transactions. The Chancellor Loan will be evidenced by a note 
(the ""Chancellor Note"") and will bear interest at a rate of 12% per annum 
(subject to increase in certain circumstances), payable quarterly, of which 
5/6 shall be payable in cash and 1/6 shall, at the Company's option, either be 
payable in cash or added to the principal amount of the Chancellor Note. In 
addition, the Company may elect to defer the 5/6 portion payable in cash, in 
which case the Chancellor Note would bear interest at a rate of 14% per annum. 
The Chancellor Note will mature on the twentieth anniversary of the date of 
issuance, provided that the Company may prepay all or part of the outstanding 
principal balance and, in certain circumstances, Chancellor Media will have the 
right to require the Company to prepay part of the outstanding principal 
balance. See ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions -- Chancellor 
Exchange Agreement"" and ""Description of Indebtedness."" 

(2) The Company will enter into the Capstar Credit Facility concurrently with 
the SFX Acquisition. The Capstar Credit Facility will consist of a $550.0 
million revolving loan facility (the ""Revolving Loan""), a $600.0 million term 
loan facility (the ""A Term Loan""), a $250.0 million term loan facility 
(the ""B Term Loan"") and additional term loans and revolving loans in an 
aggregate amount up to $500.0 million subject to future commitment availability. 
The amount shown includes borrowings of approximately $600.0 million under the 
A Term Loan and $211.8 million under the B Term Loan, net of fees and expenses 
relating to the Capstar Credit Facility. The actual amount of the borrowings 
under each facility will depend on the actual cost of the consummation of the 
SFX Transactions and other related transactions and whether all of the SFX 
Related Transactions are actually consummated before or concurrently with the 
consummation of the SFX Acquisition. See ""The Transactions -- The SFX 
Transactions"" and ""Description of Indebtedness -- Capstar Credit Facility.
"" The existing credit agreement, which has no outstanding balance, will be 
terminated when the Company enters into the Capstar Credit Facility. See 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

(3) Represents the gross proceeds received by the Company from the consummation 
of the Greenville Disposition, the Upper Fairfield Disposition, the Daytona 
Beach-WGNE Disposition, the Long Island Disposition, the Houston-KKPN 
Disposition, the Houston-KODA Disposition and the sale of SFX stations WTAE-AM 
and WJDX-FM (after the consummation of the SFX Acquisition). See 
""The Transactions."" The Company will not receive FCC approval for the Upper 
Fairfield Disposition prior to the consummation of the SFX Acquisition; 
accordingly, the Company will borrow an additional $14.9 million under the 
Chancellor Note. See ""The Transactions -- The SFX Transactions -- SFX Related 
Acquisitions."" 

(4) Includes estimated fees and expenses relating to the SFX Transactions and 
$1.2 billion for the SFX Acquisition, $90.3 million for the Austin Acquisition, 
and $35.0 million for the Nashville Acquisition. The purchase price for the SFX 
Acquisition is subject to adjustment under the circumstances described in 
""The Transactions -- The SFX Transactions -- SFX Acquisition."" 

(5) The Merger Agreement requires that the SFX Credit Facility be repaid 
concurrently with the consummation of the SFX Acquisition. See 
""The Transactions -- The SFX Transactions -- SFX Acquisition.
"" The loans under the SFX Credit Facility are subject to variable rates of 
interest and the maturity date of such loans is June 30, 2005. SFX used the 
borrowings under the SFX Credit Facility to finance permitted acquisitions, 
to provide working capital and to issue letters of credit. As of March 31, 1998, 
the SFX Credit Facility had a weighted average effective interest rate of 8.13%. 

(6) Pursuant to the terms of the 10 3/4% SFX Notes Indenture (as defined), on a 
pro forma basis at March 31, 1998, the Company intends to redeem $154.0 million 
aggregate principal amount of the 10 3/4% SFX Notes for an aggregate purchase 
price of $176.8 million, including a $16.6 million redemption premium and $6.2 
million of accrued interest. The Company will deliver a notice of redemption to 
each holder of the 10 3/4% SFX Notes from whom notes will be redeemed as soon 
as practicable after the SFX Acquisition. See ""Description of Indebtedness."" 
The Company anticipates that $154.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 
10 3/4% SFX Notes will actually be redeemed for an aggregate purchase price of 
$173.3 million, including a $16.6 million redemption premium and $2.8 million 
of accrued interest. 

(7) Pursuant to the terms of the SFX Certificate of Designation, on a pro forma 
basis at March 31, 1998, the Company intends to redeem $119.6 million 
aggregate liquidation preference of the 12 5/8% SFX Preferred Stock for an 
aggregate purchase price of $137.8 million, including a $15.1 million 
redemption premium and $3.1 million of accumulated dividends. The Company will 
deliver a notice of redemption to each holder of the 12 5/8% SFX Preferred 
Stock from whom preferred stock will be redeemed as soon as practicable after 
the SFX Acquisition. See ""Description of Capital Stock -- SFX."" The Company 
anticipates that $119.6 million aggregate liquidation preference of the 
12 5/8% SFX Preferred Stock will actually be redeemed for an aggregate purchase 
price of $141.6 million, including a $15.1 million redemption premium and $6.9 
million of accumulated dividends."

The Company intends to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
under its credit facility with BankBoston, N.A. Approximately $20.1 million was 
outstanding under that facility as of May 15, 1998. The Company's credit 
facility provides for borrowing capacity of up to $25.0 million, presently 
bears interest based on either an adjusted prime rate or the Eurodollar rate 
plus 2.0% to 2.75% per annum (the applicable rate was 8.4% as of the date of 
this Prospectus) and will mature on January 30, 2001. The credit facility was 
obtained primarily to fund acquisitions and to refinance debt incurred in 
connection with the acquisition the Company completed in September 1997. The 
terms of the credit facility permit the Company to redraw on the credit 
facility as needed for future acquisitions and capital expenditures (subject to 
certain restrictions) and general corporate purposes. On April 21, 1998, the 
Company received a preliminary letter of commitment from its lender to amend 
and increase its credit facility. The amendment is contingent on the completion 
of this offering and will, among other things, increase the Company's borrowing 
capacity to $60.0 million, modify certain covenants and lower the Company's 
borrowing costs. 

The balance of the estimated net offering proceeds will be used for 
acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital. Pending specific 
application of the net proceeds, the Company intends to invest unused net 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing securities. The Company continually 
evaluates potential acquisition candidates and intends to continue to pursue 
acquisition opportunities that may become available."

of the foregoing purposes, the Company expects that substantially all of such 
net proceeds will be invested in high quality, short-term, liquid investments. 
In addition, the Company may contribute up to $1,500,000 of the net proceeds to 
the Bank to support the Bank's lending activities. All of the foregoing uses 
are, however, subject to change, and the Company's management will have 
discretion to employ the net proceeds in any manner management deems to be in 
the Company's best interests in light of the Company's business strategy and 
banking industry and economic conditions generally. See ""Risk Factors -- 
Discretion in Use of Proceeds"" and ""Business -- Business Strategy."""

initial public offering price of $14.25 per share), after deducting the 
underwriting discount and estimated expenses, are estimated to be approximately 
$4.6 million. 

In order to eliminate the non-deductible dividend costs related to its 165,456 
shares of Series A 9% Preferred Stock (""Preferred Stock""), the Company intends 
to use a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of such shares for their per 
share liquidation value plus declared but unpaid dividends immediately after 
completion of the Offering. Assuming the Preferred Stock is redeemed on June 
30, 1998, the redemption price will be $864,507. The Company estimates that 
$230,115 of this amount will be paid to holders of Preferred Stock who are 
executive officers and directors of the Company. The Preferred Stock was issued 
in 1990. Dividends on the Preferred Stock are payable semi- annually and are 
calculated based on the $5.00 par value of such shares which is also the 
liquidation value. Dividends on the Preferred Stock are not cumulative, and the 
Company is prohibited from paying any dividends on its Common Stock until a 
dividend is declared and paid with respect to the Preferred Stock. The holders 
of Preferred Stock have no voting rights. The Preferred Stock may be redeemed, 
in whole or in part, at $5.00 per share together with all declared and unpaid 
dividends per share. 

The remaining net proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes 
including support of anticipated balance sheet growth in the Company's current 
markets, particularly in Texarkana, and for possible future market expansions 
and acquisitions. 

Pending the application of the net proceeds, the Company intends to invest such 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing securities, certificates of deposit or 
guaranteed obligations of the United States of America."

The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Common Stock Offering, 
together with the net proceeds of the Notes Offering, to repay a substantial 
portion of its existing indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and for 
general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions. The borrowings 
under the Senior Credit Facilities had been used by the Company to fund in part 
the L-3 Acquisition and the 1998 Acquisitions. The weighted average interest 
rate under the Term Loan Facilities was 7.91% at April 15, 1998. Amounts repaid 
under the Revolving Credit Facility will be available to be reborrowed by the 
Company from time to time for, among other reasons, general corporate purposes 
or to finance future acquisitions. Affiliates of the Underwriters are lenders 
under the Senior Credit Facilities and will receive a portion of the net

(1) Represents estimated expenditures to acquire systems integrators, 
programmers, applications developers and Internet service providers which the 
Company believes will enhance its prospects. In January 1998, the Company 
acquired Entelechy and certain assets of JDT WebwerX LLC. As of the date of 
this Prospectus, the Company has no plans, agreements, commitments, 
understandings or arrangements with respect to any acquisition. See 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations"" and ""Business -- Strategy."" 
(2) Represents anticipated expenditures associated with (i) the acquisition of 
additional computer hardware and software used to support network 
infrastructure, including backup and redundant capacity, (ii) the establishment 
of additional POPs in selected geographic locations and 
(iii) salaries of three additional technical support personnel. See ""Business

(3) Includes costs associated with increased print and radio advertising and 
the salaries for up to four additional marketing and sales personnel, including 
a Director of Marketing. See ""Business -- Sales and Marketing."" 

(4) Includes the repayment of (i) $200,000 principal amount of unsecured 
promissory notes (the ""1997 Notes"") issued in October 1997, together with 
accrued interest at the rate of 8% per annum, payable on the earlier of 
(a) the consummation of this offering, (b) a private placement of securities 
resulting in net proceeds to the Company in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 or 
(c) October 31, 1999; and (ii) $95,000 outstanding principal amount of 
unsecured promissory notes (the ""1995 Notes"") issued in August 1995, together 
with accrued interest at the rate of 6% per annum, payable on July 31, 1998. 
The proceeds of the 1997 Notes were used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 

(5) Working capital may be used, among other things, to pay salaries of the 
Company's executive officers (which is anticipated to be approximately $395,000 
during the twelve months following this offering), rent, telecommunications 
expenses, trade payables, consulting and professional fees and other expenses. 

If the Underwriter exercises the over-allotment option in full, the Company 
will realize additional net proceeds of $940,000, which will be allocated among 
the categories set forth above. See ""Underwriting."" 

The allocation of the net proceeds set forth above represents the Company's 
best estimates based on proposed plans and assumptions relating to its 
operations and growth strategy and general economic conditions. The Company 
believes that the proceeds of this offering, together with projected cash flow 
from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its contemplated cash 
requirements for at least twelve months following the consummation of this 
offering. In the event that the Company's plans change (due to changes in 
market conditions, competitive factors or new opportunities that may become 
available in the future), its assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or 
if the proceeds of this offering or cash flow prove to be insufficient to 
implement its business plans (due to unanticipated expenses, technical 
difficulties or otherwise), the Company may be required to reallocate the 
proceeds among the categories set forth above, use proceeds for other purposes, 
seek additional financing or curtail its expansion activities. There can be no 
assurance that the proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to permit the 
Company to implement its business plans, that any assumptions relating to the 
implementation of such plans will prove to be accurate or that any additional 
financing would be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, 
or at all. 
Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above 
will be invested principally in short-term United States Government securities,
 short-term certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term 
interest bearing investments."

offered by the Company hereby will be $112.5 million ($129.6 million, if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated Offering expenses payable
 by the Company. The Company will not receive any of the $48.9 million of net
 proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. 

Of the $112.5 million of net proceeds received by the Company, an aggregate
 of $41.9 million will be used to pay accumulated and unpaid dividends payable
 to the Selling Stockholders, repurchase senior notes held by a Selling 
Stockholder and to make other payments to insiders of the Company. 
Specifically, the Company intends to use approximately $19.4 million of the 
net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock offered by the Company to pay
 accumulated and unpaid dividends through May 15, 1998 to the Selling 
Stockholders on the shares of the Company's Outstanding Preferred Stock, which 
is being exchanged for Common Stock of the Company in connection with the
 Offering. See ""Capitalization"" and ""The Stockholders' Agreement."" In 
addition, the Company intends to utilize approximately $11.1 million of such 
net proceeds to make a one-time payment in satisfaction of benefits due to
 certain senior executive officers of the Company and the Bank under the 
Original Employment Agreements, which benefits were agreed to subject to
 consummation of the Offering. A portion of such funds will be contributed to
 a trust the Company is establishing in connection with the Offering and will
 be used to purchase Common Stock of the Company in the Offering on behalf of
 such executive officers. See ""Management--Employment Agreements--Original
 Employment Agreements and Establishment of Grantor Trust."" Furthermore, the 
Company intends to use approximately $11.4 million of such net proceeds to
 prepay the $10.0 million of senior notes (plus accrued interest through
 May 15, 1998) which were issued to the Bishop Estate in the 1995 
recapitalization. The Company also intends to use approximately $4.5 million
 of such net proceeds to pay the FDIC special assessment which the Bank had
 previously received permission from the OTS to defer. See ""Regulation--
Regulation of Federal Savings Institutions--FDIC Assessments."" A substantial
 portion of the balance of the estimated net proceeds, approximately $66.1 
million, is expected to be contributed to the Bank and initially invested in 
U.S. Government agency obligations and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed
 securities. The Bank expects to leverage such proceeds by purchasing 
primarily single-family residential loans and investment and U.S. Government
 agency obligations and U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities and
 funding such purchases through increases in deposits, short- to intermediate-
term reverse repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. Management believes the
 leveraging of such proceeds will provide the Bank with the opportunity to 
expand its business and thereby increase its earnings, which will permit 
accelerated utilization of existing NOLs. See ""Risk Factors-- Impact of 
Ownership Change on Use of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards,"" ""--Risk that

 approximately $100.0 million in cash from the sale of the NTT Shares. The 
combined net proceeds are expected to be used to further the Company's
 acquisition, Buyout and investment strategy, to continue the development and
 implementation of the national backbone, customer care center, network
 operations center and billing and accounting services, and to fund the
 Company's general working capital requirements. See ""Management's Discussion

discussion of the Company's anticipated funding requirements. 

Management will retain a significant amount of discretion over the application
 of the net proceeds of the Offering. Because of the number and variability of
 factors that determine the Company's use of the net proceeds of the Offering,
 there can be no assurance that such applications will not vary substantially
 from the Company's current intentions. Pending such utilization, the Company
 intends to invest the net proceeds of the Offering in investment grade

Offering are estimated to be $48.8 million, after deducting the estimated 
expenses of the Combined Offering payable by the Company, including 
underwriting commissions with respect to the Common Stock sold by the Company. 
Such net proceeds will be used by the Company for general corporate purposes, 
including approximately $15.4 million to repay indebtedness incurred in 
connection with the acquisition, consummated on May 1, 1998 (subject to local 
government approval), of the real estate and building of its main facility in 
Germany owned by the Murmann family, $15.0 million to repay long-term 
indebtedness of Sauer under a revolving credit agreement and the remainder to 
fund a portion of the Company's 1998-2000 capital expenditure program. The 
indebtedness incurred to acquire the principal German facility bears interest 
at a rate of 5% per year and matures on November 1, 1998. The long-term 
indebtedness to be repaid bears interest at a rate of 7.05% per year as of 
December 31, 1997 and matures in August 2001. See ""Relationship with Principal 
Stockholder"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

The Company presently expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $150-
$230 million during the 1998-2000 period. The Company expects these capital 
expenditures to be used primarily for the construction of new manufacturing 
facilities and the purchase of manufacturing equipment for all its business 
units to increase production capacity for new and existing products, to 
increase production efficiencies and for replacement purposes. See 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."" Pending such application, the 
net proceeds will be used to reduce approximately $18.3 million of short-term 
indebtedness under a revolving credit facility used to fund working capital, 
which bears interest at a rate of 4.29% per year as of December 31, 1997, 
matures at various times over the next year and is callable at any time. Repaid
amounts of such short-term indebtedness will be reborrowed to pay capital

(1) Includes repayment of principal and accrued interest on the Bridge Loans, 
the December 1997 Loans, and the 1998 Loans. The Bridge Loans all provide for 
accruing interest at 10% per annum, with all interest and principal due upon
 the earlier to occur of five business days after completion of the Offering, 
or 24 months. The December 1997 Loans provide for accruing interest at 12% per
 annum, with all interest and principal due upon the earlier to occur of five 
business days after completion of the Offering, or June 1, 1998. The 1998 Loans 
accrue interest at 10-10.5% per annum with all interest and principal due upon 
the earlier to occur of five business days after completion of the Offering or 
June 1, 1998 except certain loans which mature on July 1, 1998 or five business 
days after the completion of the Offering, whichever is earlier. The Bridge 
Loans were issued between December 1996 and May 1997. All but two of the Bridge 
Loans contain a provision which allows the Company to convert the amount owed 
to Common Stock at a conversion price of the lesser of $5.50 per share; or the 
most recent cash price paid by an unrelated purchaser of Common Stock from the 
Company in an arms' length transaction prior to the date of conversion. All of 
the proceeds from the Bridge Loans, the December 1997 Loans, and the 1998 Loans 
were expended on research and development, working capital and general 
corporate purposes. The amount shown above also includes repayment of certain 
equipment leases guaranteed by certain officers and directors of the Company in 
the approximate amount of $145,000. See ""Certain Transactions"" and ""Bridge
 Loans."" 

(2) The Company is negotiating to enter into a lease in order to relocate its 
facilities to an approximately 28,400 square foot single user building 
presently under construction. Includes the Company's estimate of costs to 
conform the building to its requirements. 

(3) Represents application of proceeds to acquire all of the outstanding 
(19,250) shares of IHI pursuant to existing agreements between the Company and 
each of the 20 IHI shareholders, and payment of $42,000 in deferred consulting 
fees due from IHI to two officers and directors of the Company. 

The estimates shown above exclude any proceeds from exercise of any of the 
Warrants, the Representatives' Option, the Over-allotment Option, and other 
outstanding options and warrants to acquire the Common Stock of the Company. 
The Common Shares included in all Units purchased pursuant to exercise of the 
Over-allotment Option will be sold by Knickerbocker and the Company will not 
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of such Common Shares. The Company 
will receive the proceeds from the sale of the Warrants included in all Units 
purchased pursuant to exercise of the Over-allotment Option. The net proceeds, 
if any, from the exercise of the Warrants, the Representatives' Option or other 
outstanding options and warrants will be added to working capital. 
The Company may use a portion of the net proceeds of this Offering to acquire 
businesses, products, or technologies anticipated by management to be 
complementary to those of the Company. The Company has no present plans, 
agreements, or commitments and is not currently engaged in any negotiations 
with respect to any such transaction. 

The Board of Directors has broad discretion in determining how the net proceeds 
of this Offering will be applied. The foregoing represents the Company's best 
estimate of the allocation and use of proceeds based upon its present plans and 
certain assumptions including industry conditions and the Company's anticipated 
expenditures. The projected expenditures described above are estimates and 
approximations only and do not represent firm commitments of the Company. 
Actual expenditures may vary substantially from these estimates depending upon 
many factors, including the costs and results of research and product 
development activities, marketing studies, product testing, product 
availability, costs of third party manufacturing facilities, market acceptance 
of the Company's proposed containers, changes in current regulations or 
competitive conditions, and the availability of other financing arrangements. 

The Company's future capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, 
including the amount of revenues generated from operations (if any), the cost 
of the Company's sales and marketing activities and the progress of the 
Company's research and development activities, none of which can be predicted 
with certainty. The Company anticipates the proceeds of this Offering, together 
with existing capital resources and cash generated from operations, if any, 
will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements for at least the 
next 18 to 24 months at its anticipated level of operations. However, the 
Company may seek additional funding during the next 24 months and could seek 
additional funding after such time. There can be no assurance any additional 
financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, when required by 
the Company. Moreover, if additional financing is not available, the Company 
could be required to reduce or suspend its operations, seek an acquisition 
partner or sell securities on terms that may be highly dilutive or otherwise 
disadvantageous to investors purchasing the Units offered hereby. The Company 
has experienced in the past, and may continue to experience, operational 
difficulties and delays in its product development due to working capital 
constraints. Any such difficulties or delays could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of 
operations. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
 and Results of Operations"" and Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

Pending use of the proceeds from this Offering as set forth above, the Company 
will invest all or a portion of such proceeds in short-term bank certificates 
of deposit, U.S. Government obligations, money market investments, and short-
term investment grade securities."

$6,792,885 and $5,092,859 and bear interest at the rates of 9% (with deferred 
interest accrued at the rate of 12%) and 7.25%, respectively, with respective 
maturity dates of June 1, 2004 and January 2, 2006. The amounts actually 
expended by the Company for working capital purposes will depend upon a number 
of factors, including future revenue growth, the amount of cash generated by 
the Company's operations and the progress of the Company's product development 
efforts. The Company may also use a portion of such net proceeds to acquire or 
invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to those 
of the Company, although no specific acquisitions are planned as of the date of 
this Prospectus, and no portion of the net proceeds has been allocated for any 
particular acquisition.

Technology Development/New Product Discovery. The Company intends to spend a
 portion of the proceeds of this Offering in the development of certain 
technologies related to the discovery of new drug targets and new drug 
products in the area of infectious diseases and other disease areas where the
 Company believes business opportunities exist. Such expenses would likely
 include the hiring of additional scientific staff, enlargement of facilities
 and the establishment of contractual relationships with academic or commercial
 entities. 

Product Development Expenses. The Company intends to continue investing in the
 further development of its passive antibody and other infectious disease
 therapeutic products. Where appropriate, resources may be applied to 
laboratory studies, manufacturing methods development, product manufacturing,
 formal pre- clinical or clinical studies to support product licensure. With 
respect to the Company's CDAD therapeutic antitoxin product, these funds will
 supplement
 funds paid to the Company pursuant to the Lilly Agreements for the pre-
clinical and clinical studies. 

Capital Expenditures. The Company expects to spend a portion of the net 
proceeds of this Offering to make capital investments in laboratories and 
related facilities, including the establishment of manufacturing facilities 
and purchase of equipment for the pilot production of its passive antibody 
products. The initial phase of this capital investment includes acquisition of 
land and the design of a pilot manufacturing facility. The Company expects to
 begin construction of this facility within twelve months from the date of 
this Offering. The Company also expects to secure long-term debt financing of
 up to approximately $7.5 million to complete construction of its manufacturing
 facility. 

Working Capital and General Corporate Purposes. The remaining available funds 
will be added to the Company's working capital to be used for general corporate
 purposes, including the hiring of research, management, regulatory, 
manufacturing and business development personnel; rent and other overhead 
costs for facilities; equipment and machinery needed for research, 
manufacturing and administrative functions; and the costs for patenting, 
licensing or acquiring technologies. 

The Company intends to proceed with the expenditures to advance the 
development of its infectious disease technologies and products. This 
development is anticipated to include prototype optimization, pre-clinical 
development, clinical prototype manufacturing, and human clinical evaluations.
 The Company also anticipates investigating new therapeutic and diagnostic 
technologies and exploring additional commercial opportunities. 

The amounts actually expended for each purpose may vary significantly 
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of the Company's 
research and development programs, the results of clinical studies, the timing 
of regulatory approvals, technological advances, and determinations as to
 commercial potential and the status of competitive products. The Company may 
also, to the extent its product development activities proceed more quickly 
than expected, expand its research and development facilities or allocate a 
portion of the proceeds to the construction or acquisition and staffing of 
manufacturing facilities for the production of any developed products. In 
addition, if the Company deems it desirable to acquire assets or technologies 
to further its development objectives, the Company may reapportion proceeds of
 this offering to such acquisition or development. Expenditures will also be
 dependent upon the establishment of collaborative arrangements with other
 companies, the availability of financing, and other factors. See ""Risk Factors
 -- Management's Broad Discretion in Use of Proceeds."" 
Subject to the variables set forth above, the Company anticipates that the net
 proceeds of this Offering, together with its available cash, should be
 sufficient to finance its operational and working capital requirements for 
at least the 12 months following the date of this Prospectus. However, there
 can be no assurance that the net proceeds of this Offering will satisfy the
 Company's requirements for any particular period of time. The Company 
anticipates that additional funding will be required after the use of proceeds
 of the Offering. The Company may seek to raise additional capital from future
 offerings of equity, corporate partnerships or debt financings. No assurance
 can be given that such additional financing will be available when needed on
 terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. See ""Risk Factors -- Need for 
Substantial Additional Funds."" 

Pending application of the net proceeds of the Offering, the Company intends 
to invest such net proceeds in interest-bearing investment grade financial 
securities."

be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain satisfactory equipment 
financing arrangements. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations"" and ""Business -- Manufacturing."" 
(2) Represents anticipated costs to acquire products or businesses which the 
Company believes will enhance its growth prospects. As of the date of this 
Prospectus, the Company has no plans, agreements, commitments, understandings

(3) Consists of the repayment of (i) $850,000 to the Bank and (ii) up to 
$850,000 to Ilana Frydman, the wife of Uziel Frydman, Chairman, President and 
Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Company intends to reduce amounts
 outstanding under its line of credit with the Bank, permitting it to utilize 
the full borrowing availability under the line of credit. Borrowings under the 
line of credit vary daily based on the Company's working capital requirements. 
At January 31, 1998 and February 28, 1998, approximately $1,419,589 and 
$1,141,589, respectively, was outstanding under the line of credit. Interest 
accrues on advances made under the line of credit at the prime rate established 
by the Bank (8.5% at January 31, 1998). The line of credit expires on November 
30, 1998. Advances under the line of credit have been used to finance increased 
levels of inventories and accounts receivable. The Company also intends to 
repay the remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest at the rate of 
9% per annum under a promissory note payable to Ilana Frydman. Such 
indebtedness is due on demand after March 1, 1999. See ""Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations"" and ""Certain

(4) Represents amounts to be used in connection with sales, marketing and 
promotional activities, including advertising in trade journals, preparation of 
sales literature and participation at trade shows. See ""Business -- Marketing,

(5) Working capital may be used, among other things, to pay for inventories, 
rent, trade payables, professional fees and other expenses. 
If the Underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full with respect to 
the Warrants, the Company will realize additional net proceeds of $10,230 which 
will be added to working capital. The Company will not realize any additional 
net proceeds if the Underwriter exercises its over-allotment option with 
respect to the Class A Common Stock. 

Based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its operations, 
the Company believes that the proceeds of this offering, together with 
projected cash flow from operations and available cash resources, including its 
line of credit, will be sufficient to satisfy its contemplated cash 
requirements for at least twelve months following the consummation of this 
offering. In the event that the Company's plans change (due to changes in 
market conditions, competitive factors or new or different business 
opportunities that may become available in the future), its assumptions change 
or prove to be inaccurate or if the proceeds of this offering or cash flow 
prove to be insufficient to implement the Company's proposed expansion strategy 
(due to unanticipated expenses, operating difficulties or otherwise), the 
Company may find it necessary to reallocate a portion of the proceeds within 
the above-described categories, use proceeds for other purposes, seek 
additional financing or curtail its expansion activities. There can be no 
assurance that additional financing, if required, will be available to the 
Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest 
bearing investments."

offered hereby (including the Adelphia Share Purchase), after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the Offerings, 
are estimated to be approximately $236 million (approximately $264 million if 
the U.S. Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). 

The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from the Offerings and 
the Adelphia Share Purchase, together with the remaining net proceeds from the 
offerings of the Senior Secured Notes, the Preferred Stock and the AT&T Lease 
Agreement, to fund the Company's capital expenditures, working capital 
requirements, operating losses and pro rata investments in Operating Companies 
and for general corporate purposes. The Operating Companies and the Company 
will invest a substantial portion of these proceeds in capital expenditures. 
These capital expenditures will include: (i) connecting new buildings to the 
Company's networks; (ii) purchasing electronics (including switches) to 
increase the services capabilities of the Company's Existing Networks 
(including the completion of the four networks currently under construction) 
and (iii) funding construction of the New Networks over the next eighteen 
months. The Company estimates that it will require approximately $420 million 
to fund anticipated capital expenditures, working capital requirements and 
operating losses of the Company and investments in its Existing Networks and 
its New Networks through the end of 1999. The Company believes that the net 
proceeds from the Offerings and the Adelphia Share Purchase, together with its 
existing cash balance and internally generated funds, will be sufficient to 
fund the Company's capital expenditures, working capital requirements, 
operating losses and pro rata investments in the Operating Companies (exclusive 
of future increases in ownership interests in the Operating Companies, if any, 
and the funds necessary to acquire LMDS spectrum as a result of the LMDS 
Auction and any additional funds allocated to the construction and deployment 
of associated facilities) through mid-2000. In addition, the Company may use a 
portion of the proceeds to acquire its Local Partner's interests in its 
Existing Networks or to purchase other telecommunications-related assets. 
Management will retain a substantial amount of discretion over the application 
of the net proceeds of the Offerings and there can be no assurance that the 
application of net proceeds will not vary significantly from the Company's 
current plans. Pending such uses, the net proceeds will be invested in short-
term, highly liquid investment-grade securities. 

The Company intends to evaluate potential acquisitions as a means to further 
develop its market presence and product offerings. The Company has no definite 
agreement with respect to any acquisition, although from time to time it has 
discussions with other companies and assesses opportunities on an ongoing 
basis. A portion of the net proceeds from the Offerings may also be used to
finance acquisitions."

Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The 
principal purpose of this Offering is to obtain additional working capital. 

The Company expects to use the net proceeds of this Offering for general 
corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital. The 
Company anticipates spending at least $600,000 for furniture and leasehold 
improvements related to the expansion of its facilities and approximately $1.3 
million for other capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending March 31, 
1999. In addition, the Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds of 
this Offering to repay approximately $3.4 million of debt that has a maturity 
date of December 1, 1999 and bears interest at the lender's prime rate. The 
amounts actually expended for these purposes will depend on numerous factors. 
As of the date of this Prospectus, the Company has no specific plans regarding 
the use of the remainder of the net proceeds of this Offering. In addition, a 
portion of the proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in complimentary 
businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complimentary 
technologies. The Company has no present understandings, commitments, or 
agreements with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, 
products, or technologies. The Company's management will retain broad 
discretion in the allocation of a substantial portion of the net proceeds.

Common Stock and the $180,000,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes 
offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately $479,350,000 
(approximately $559,757,500 if the Underwriters' over-allotment options are 
exercised in full), after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated 
offering expenses. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
the shares of Common Stock offered hereby by the Selling Stockholder. 

Approximately $154 million of the net proceeds to the Company from the 
Offerings will be used to repay the Non-Compliant Loans, which, following 
planned repayments of portions thereof prior to the Offerings, will have 
outstanding balances of $43 million, $50 million and $61 million. These loans 
are due May 1998, October 2000 and April 2001, respectively, and accrue 
interest annually at rates equal to 7.16%, 6.78% and 6.68%, respectively, at 
December 31, 1997, which rates represent LIBOR plus a spread. The $43 million 
loan was incurred in August 1997 in order to redeem $40 million of Floating 
Rate Notes issued by AAP and to repay certain short-term debt. The Company is 
not in compliance with certain covenants under the above-described loans and, 
as a result, the Company's obligation to repay these loans may be accelerated 
by the lenders at any time. These loan covenants include restrictions on the 
ability of one of the Company's subsidiaries to enter into transactions with 
affiliates, requirements that the subsidiary maintain certain debt-to-equity 
ratios and requirements that the subsidiary comply with certain notice 
requirements. As a result of such non-compliance, these loans have been 
classified as current liabilities in the Company's financial statements 
included herein, and the report of the Company's independent public accountants 
with respect to such financial statements contains a paragraph stating that 
there is substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a 
going concern. Repayment of such loans from the proceeds of the Offerings will 
eliminate these events of non-compliance. 

Approximately $63 million of the net proceeds to the Company from the Offerings 
will be used to repay numerous short-term bank loans incurred primarily to 
finance capital expenditures for the Company's P1 factory in the Philippines 
and for working capital. All of these loans are due within 12 months of 
December 31, 1997 and bear interest at rates ranging from 8.0% to 12.2%. In 
addition, approximately $8 million of the net proceeds will be used to repay 
two term loans of approximately $3 million and $5 million. These loans are due 
September 1999 and January 2001, respectively, and accrue interest annually at 
rates equal to 9.09% and 11.88%, respectively, at December 31, 1997, which 
rates represent LIBOR plus a spread. 

An additional approximately $34 million of the net proceeds to the Company will 
be used to purchase AICL's 40% interest in AAP. Approximately $88 million of 
the net proceeds will be used to repay all of the amounts that will remain due 
to AUSA following planned repayments of portions thereof prior to the 
Offerings. The remaining $132 million of such net proceeds ($213 million if the 
Underwriters' over-allotment options are exercised in full) will be used for 
capital expenditures and working capital. Pending such uses, the net proceeds 
to the Company of the Offerings will be invested in investment grade, interest-
bearing securities."

offered by Rock by this Prospectus are estimated to be $26,600,000 
($31,245,350 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full),
 after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated Offering expenses 
payable by Rock, at the initial public offering price of $10.00 per Common
 Share. Rock will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Shares by 
the Selling Shareholders, but it will receive approximately $1.5 million of
 proceeds from the options exercised by the Selling Shareholders to acquire 
the shares they are selling. 

The net proceeds of the Offering will be used (i) to pay the Shareholder 
Distribution Amount ($17.0 million calculated as of March 31, 1998 after giving
 effect to the $5.4 million tax distribution to Existing Shareholders on April
 10, 1998) to the Existing Shareholders in connection with termination of 
Rock's status as an S corporation (see ""Termination of S Corporation Status""),
 and (ii) to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under Rock's warehouse
 line of credit used to finance, and secured by, a portion of Rock's inventory 
of loans (approximately $9.6 million based on the March 31, 1998 Shareholder
 Distribution Amount, as adjusted for the April 10, 1998 tax distribution).
 The Shareholder Distribution Amount is expected to increase by the 
distribution date as a result of additional S corporation income, and, 
therefore, the proceeds used to repay a portion of the warehouse line of credit
 are expected to decrease. Although not required to do so, Daniel Gilbert 
expects to repay the balance of his loans from Rock ($1.6 million as of March 
31, 1998) with his share of the Shareholder Distribution Amount, and Rock 
expects to use that cash to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under
 its warehouse line of credit. 

Rock's warehouse line of credit currently provides for up to $150 million 
principal amount of demand loans. The loans bear interest at rates that vary, 
depending on the type of underlying loan, from the bank's prime rate to 1.5% to 
2.5% over the federal funds rate (resulting in a weighted average interest rate
 of 6.94% during 1997). The warehouse line of credit expires, with respect to 
loans committed to be made by any particular lender, 75 days after that lender
 demands payment, unless that lender is replaced. Borrowings under the 
warehouse line of credit are used to fund loans closed by Rock. As of March 31,
 1998, Rock had borrowed $68.8 million under this facility. 
Rock might use some of the net proceeds of the Offering or other cash for 
possible acquisitions of other businesses engaged in retail origination of 
consumer loans. Although the Company regularly reviews potential acquisition
 opportunities, it has not entered into a letter of intent or definitive
 agreement with any acquisition candidates and there can be no assurance that 
Rock will enter into any such agreements or acquire any acquisition candidates. See ""Business -- Business Strategy."" 

Pending their ultimate application, the net proceeds to Rock from the Offering
 will be invested in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities,
 deposit accounts or both."

 underwriting discount and estimated Offering expenses. Of this amount, 
approximately $27.8 million will be used to pay the cash portion of the 
purchase price for the Founding Companies, $4.5 million will be used to pay 
the cash portion of the purchase price for Keystone, and approximately $500,000
 will be used to pay expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisitions. In
 connection with the acquisitions of the Founding Companies and Keystone, the
 Company will assume outstanding indebtedness of the Founding Companies in the
 aggregate amount of $9.8 million and $793,000 of outstanding indebtedness of
 Keystone. Assumed indebtedness of $1.6 million will be repaid from the net
 proceeds of the Offering, which indebtedness bears interest at a rate of 10%
 and matures in March 1999. In addition, certain owners of the Founding 
Companies have guaranteed obligations of the respective Founding Companies. The
 Company intends to obtain the release of these guarantees as soon as 
practicable following consummation of the Offering. 

The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which
 are expected to include working capital and future acquisitions. Pending the 
foregoing uses, the proceeds will be invested in short-term, investment- grade,
 interest-bearing securities. While the Company continuously considers possible
 acquisition prospects as part of its growth strategy, the Company presently
 has no agreements, arrangements or other understandings to acquire any 
companies other than the Founding Companies and Keystone."

Stock offered hereby are estimated to be $20.8 million ($24.0 million if the 
Underwriters' over allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting the 
estimated expenses of the Offering. The Company anticipates using such net 
proceeds to repay certain debt, pursue strategic acquisitions, expand 
manufacturing capacity, finance working capital requirements and fund other 
general corporate purposes. 

Specifically, the Company anticipates using $3.8 million of the proceeds to 
retire $3.4 million of term debt, which accrues interest at an annual rate of 
9% and matures in November 2000, with Magna Bank, N.A. (the ""Bank"") and a 
mortgage for $0.4 million held by the Oklahoma Industrial Finance Authority 
secured by the Company's Tulsa, Oklahoma facility. 

Pending the use of the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of Common Stock 
as described above, such funds will be used to reduce temporarily the principal 
balance under the Company's credit facility, as amended, with the Bank, dated 
as of March 30, 1998 (the ""Credit Facility""), which provides for the 
availability of up to $15.0 million of borrowings until March 31, 2000. At 
March 31, 1998, the outstanding principal balance under the Credit Facility 
was $1.5 million, the effective interest rate thereon was 7.09% and the unused 
availability thereunder was approximately $13.5 million. Of the $1.5 million 
drawn on the Credit Facility, the Company used $0.8 million to retire certain 
outstanding subordinated debt, $0.3 million to retire certain shareholder debt 
and the balance to reduce certain senior secured indebtedness. After application
of the net proceeds of this Offering to the temporary repayment of the 
outstanding principal balance on the Credit Facility, the Company intends to 
make additional borrowings under the Credit Facility for the foregoing purposes.
 

The unused net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock and the Credit Facility
may be used to support the Company's growth strategies through, among other 
things, the funding of acquisitions of complementary businesses. Although 
the Company has had and expects to have discussions with potential acquisition 
candidates it does not have any present agreements or understandings with 
respect to any specific acquisitions. Changes in the proposed use of net 
proceeds may be made in response to, among other things, changes in the 
Company's plans and its future revenues and expenditures, as well as changes 
in general industry conditions and technology. Furthermore, no general corporate
purpose has been specifically identified by the Company at this time. 

The Company believes that the net proceeds of this Offering, cash flow from 
operations, trade credit and its existing line of credit will be sufficient to 
meet its immediate cash needs and finance its plans for expansion for the 
indefinite future. This belief is based upon certain assumptions regarding the 
Company's business and cash flow as well as prevailing industry and economic 
conditions. The Company's capital requirements may vary significantly, depending
on how rapidly management seeks to expand the business and the expansion 
strategies elected."

are $49.9 million ($57.7 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full), after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated 
offering expenses payable by the Company. The net proceeds of the Offering, 
together with the Company's existing cash and cash equivalents, will be used 
for: (i) repayment of approximately $37.4 million of debt outstanding pursuant 
to the Credit Facility, (ii) general corporate purposes, including investments 
in facilities to accommodate any newly acquired products, development of 
branded product line extensions and internally developed generic products and 
expansion of the sales force, and (iii) acquisition of additional branded 
products. The Company is actively pursuing the acquisition of rights to several 
products which may require the use of substantial capital resources. There are 
no present agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition. See 
""Risk Factors -- Dependence on Acquisition of Products"" and ""Business -- 
Strategy."" 

As required by the Credit Facility, the Company will use approximately 
$37.4 million of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay a portion of the 
outstanding debt under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility includes a 
six-year $20.0 million revolving line of credit, a six-year $90.0 million 
amortizing Tranche A term loan facility and an eight-year $85.0 million Tranche 
B term loan facility with customary covenants and with a floating interest rate
based on either LIBOR, the prime rate, or the fed funds rate, plus an 
applicable margin, selected at the discretion of the Company. At March 31, 1998
interest rates for the various components of the Credit Facility ranged from 
approximately 8.4% to 8.9%. A portion of the proceeds of the Credit Facility 
were used to consummate the Sterile Products Acquisition, purchase the 
Parkedale Facility and acquire certain contract manufacturing for third parties.
Proceeds of the Credit Facility were also used to pay off outstanding amounts 
of approximately $48.2 million under a prior credit facility. This prior credit 
facility was used to finance the Glaxo Acquisition and to pay off approximately 
$19.0 million of long-term debt which had been outstanding. This credit facility
included a five-year revolving line of credit and term loan in the aggregate 
amount of $52.0 million with customary covenants and with a floating interest 
rate based on either LIBOR, the prime rate, or the fed funds rate, plus an 
applicable margin, selected at the discretion of the Company. 

The cost, timing and amount of funds required for all specific uses by the 
Company cannot be precisely determined by the Company at this time and is at 
management's discretion. The rate of the Company's progress in acquiring new 
branded products or acquiring companies with such products, the timing and 
nature of regulatory action and the availability of alternative methods of 
financing, will also determine the allocation and timing of the Company's use 
of the proceeds from the Offering. Pending application of the proceeds as 
described above, the Company plans to invest the net proceeds of the Offering 
in short-term marketable securities. The Company will not receive any of the 
proceeds of shares sold by the Selling Shareholders."

facilitate future access for the Company to the public equity markets and 
enhance the Company's ability to use its Common Stock as consideration for 
potential acquisitions and as a means of attracting and retaining key employees.

principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for the 
Company's Common Stock, to facilitate future access by the Company to public 
equity markets and to increase the Company's equity capital. 

The Company intends to use $4.6 million of the proceeds to pay outstanding bank 
indebtedness and a related prepayment premium. Of this amount, $4.0 million 
will be used to prepay outstanding indebtedness and to pay a prepayment premium 
of $160,000, pursuant to the Company's loan agreement with a bank. Such 
indebtedness currently bears interest at the rate of 11% per annum and requires 
principal payments of $250,000 beginning on March 31, 2001 and each subsequent 
quarter end through December 31, 2002. Thereafter, principal payments of 
$500,000 are due on March 31, 2003 and each subsequent quarter end, with the 
final payment becoming due on November 30, 2003. Additionally, the Company 
intends to use a portion of the proceeds to repay $450,000 outstanding under

opportunities to enter into strategic acquisitions, including potential 
business combinations and investments in complementary companies, assets,

the underwriting discounts and commissions and payment of estimated offering 
expenses by the Company. See ""Underwriting."" 

The principal uses of the net proceeds of the offering are (a) to pay the 
Merger Consideration, (b) to contribute additional capital to the Bank, (c) to 
pay in full the principal of and interest on the indebtedness (the ""Borrowings"")
that is owed to Steven R. Abel, Robert C. Reed and D. Warren Robison 
(collectively, the ""Founders""), all of whom are directors and executive officers
of the Company, and that was used to finance the organization, general operating
and preopening expenses, certain indirect costs of the acquisition of the Bank 
and certain prepayments of the offering costs, and (d) for general corporate 
purposes, including possible branch expansion. The Borrowings (which at March 
31, 1998 were in the aggregate amount of principal and interest of approximately
$172,000) have funded the payment of certain of the Company's preopening 
expenses, including, but not limited to, professional and other fees and 
expenses in connection with efforts to acquire or form a bank to be located in 
Shelbyville, Indiana, the offering and the organization of the Company, 
including compensation and benefit expense, and directors' fees paid prior to 
the closing of the offering. See ""Related Party Transactions -- Redemption of 
Stock and Loans from Founders."" The aggregate amount of the Borrowings will be 
repaid at the closing of the offering and will be greater than the amount owed 
to the Founders at March 31, 1998 because of the accrual of additional interest 
and the Company's anticipated additional Borrowings from the Founders prior to 
the closing of the offering for the payment of expenses and costs of the Company. 
In lieu of a cash payment to retire the Borrowings, the Founders may elect to 
receive repayment in full or in part through their receipt in the offering of 
shares of Common Stock valued at the initial public offering price of $12.00 
per share.
 
The Company expects to apply the net proceeds of this offering in the following 
approximate amounts: 


Payment of Merger Consideration to shareholders of SCB....  $10,626,000    65.2%

The Company expects that the Bank will use $2,154,000 of offering proceeds 
received from the Company in connection with the contribution of additional 
capital to the Bank as working capital which will enable the Bank to be 
classified as ""well capitalized"" under the FDIC's regulations implementing the 
prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 (""FDICIA""). See ""Supervision and Regulation -- 
Regulations Applicable to the Bank as a Savings Bank or Commercial Bank, Prompt 
Corrective Action."" 

The Company and the Bank retain discretion as to the use of working capital, 
although at present there are no plans to use working capital for purposes other
than general corporate purposes, including, in the case of the Bank, the 
funding of the additional loans by the Bank to its customers and the acquisition
of investment securities for the Bank's investment portfolio. Although these 
funds would be available to finance possible acquisitions of other financial 
institutions or branches thereof or expansion into other lines of business 
closely related to banking, the Company has no present plans to do so. The 
Company has not determined how to apply the proceeds of any sale of Common Stock
upon any exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option, but presently 
anticipates retaining those amounts as working capital of the Company and not 
contributing those amounts to the capital of the Bank."

$13.0 million (approximately $15.0 million if the Underwriter's over-allotment

$12.00 per share. The Company intends to contribute approximately $10.0 million 
of net proceeds to the Bank to support the anticipated future growth of the 
Bank and the remainder of the net proceeds will be used by the Company for 
general corporate purposes. The Bank intends to use the capital received from

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently estimated that 
such net proceeds will be between $5.12 million and $7.05 million, based on the 
current Estimated Valuation Range. If the gross proceeds of the shares sold are 
increased to 15% above the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range, it is 
estimated that net proceeds will equal $8.16 million. See ""PRO FORMA DATA"" for 
the assumptions used to arrive at these amounts. The actual net proceeds may 
vary materially from the estimated amounts described herein. The Company expects
 to retain 50% of the proceeds of the Offering and will use the balance to 
purchase the capital stock of the Bank to be issued in the Conversion. 

The Company expects to use the portion of the net proceeds it retains for 
working capital and investment purposes. The Company does not expect to have 
significant operating expenses and anticipates that initially it will invest 
the net proceeds it retains primarily in interest-earning deposits, U.S. 
government, federal agency and other marketable securities and mortgage-backed 
securities. The types and amounts of such investments will vary from time to 
time based upon the interest rate environment, asset/liability mix 
considerations and other factors. 

Net proceeds paid to the Bank initially will become part of the Bank's general 
funds and will be invested primarily in mortgage and other loans, and 
investments consisting primarily of interest-earning deposit balances, U.S. 
government and federal agency obligations and other marketable securities in 
accordance with the Bank's lending and investment policies. The relative 
amounts to be invested in each of these types of investments will depend upon 
loan demand, rates of return and asset/liability matching considerations at the 
time the investments are to be made. Management is not able to predict the 
yields which will be produced by the investment of the proceeds of the Offering 
because such yields will be significantly influenced by general economic 
conditions and the interest rate environment existing at the time the 
investments are made. Remaining net proceeds paid to the Bank will be used for 
general corporate purposes. 

The proceeds of the Offering will result in an increase in the Bank's net worth 
and regulatory capital and may enhance the potential for growth through 
increased lending and investment activities, branch expansion, ATMs or 
otherwise. The net proceeds retained by the Company could be used to support 
the future expansion of operations of the Company through the opening of a 
branch office in or adjacent to the Bank's primary market area. The Company has 
no current plans to open any additional office. Payments for shares of Common 
Stock of the Company made through the withdrawal of existing deposit accounts at
 the Bank will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by the 
Bank. 

Upon completion of the Conversion, the Board of Directors will have the 
authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to statutory and regulatory 
requirements. Based upon facts and circumstances which may arise following the 
Conversion, the Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the 
future. Such facts and circumstances may include but are not limited to 
(i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the Common Stock is 
trading, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rates of return and risks involved in the 
investments, (ii) the ability to increase the book value and earnings per share
 of the remaining outstanding shares, and improve the Company's return on 
equity; 
(iii) the reduction of dilution to stockholders caused by having to issue 
additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee 
stock benefit plans; and (iv) any other circumstances in which repurchases 
would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of 
Directors that both the Company and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of 
applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and that capital 
will be adequate taking into account, among other things, the level of 
nonperforming assets and other risks, the Company's and the Bank's current and 
projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic 
environment and tax and other regulatory considerations. Federal regulations 
require that, subject to certain exceptions, the Company must obtain approval 
of the Federal Reserve prior to repurchasing Common Stock in excess of 10% of 
its net worth during any twelve-month period. See ""SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
-- Regulation of the Company -- Dividend and Repurchase Limitations."" 
The Company and the Bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement which 
contemplates the filing of consolidated tax returns at a yet undetermined 
future time when most advantageous to the Company, the Bank and the Company's 
shareholders. However, the Company and the Bank have no present intention to 
file consolidated tax returns, thus preserving for the Company the ability to 
use a portion of the proceeds to make a return of capital in the future. 
However, the Company has not made any decision to pay such a return of capital. 
The Company and the Bank have agreed to notify the FDIC before making a return 
of capital during the first three years following the Conversion. See ""DIVIDEND 
POLICY."" 

At any time following approval of the MRP by the Company's stockholders, it is 
expected that the MRP may acquire a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 
4% of the number of shares issued in the Conversion. See ""MANAGEMENT OF THE 
BANK -- Proposed Management Recognition Plan."" Such shares may be acquired in 
the open market or acquired through the Company's issuance of authorized but 
unissued shares. In the event shares are acquired in the open market, the funds 
for such purchase may be provided by the Bank from the proceeds of the 
Conversion. It is estimated that between 22,440 and 30,360 shares (34,914 shares 
at the maximum, as adjusted) may be acquired by the MRP, assuming the issuance 
of between 561,000 and 759,000 shares (872,850 shares at the maximum, as 
adjusted), respectively, in the Conversion. If the Common Stock is acquired in 
the open market it will be purchased at a price equal to the fair market value 
of the Common Stock at the time of purchase, which price may be greater or lower
 than the offering price of $10.00 per share of Common Stock. If all such shares
 were acquired by the MRP in the open market, and if such shares were acquired 
at a price of $10.00 per share, the Bank would contribute between $224,400 and 
$303,600 ($349,914 at the maximum, as adjusted), respectively, to the MRP for 
this purpose."

A Common Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately 
$22.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A Common Stock by 
Cognizant in this offering. See ""Principal and Selling Stockholders."" 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase the Company's equity 
capital, to establish a public market for the Company's Class A Common Stock, 
to provide enhanced equity incentives to attract and retain key employees, to 
increase the Company's visibility in the marketplace, to facilitate future 
access to public capital markets and to obtain additional working capital. 

The Company will use a portion of the net proceeds to repay the intercompany 
balance owed to Cognizant, which was approximately $6.5 million as of March 31,
 1998. This amount is subject to change based on the Company's operations 
between March 31, 1998 and the consummation of this offering. This intercompany 
balance is the result of certain advances from Cognizant consisting of 
approximately $3.4 million used to purchase the minority interest of the 
Company's Indian subsidiary and the remainder primarily to fund payroll and 
accounts payable. The Company does not pay interest on its intercompany 
advances from Cognizant. Of the remaining net proceeds, up to $3.5 million will 
be used for capital expenditures in 1998, primarily for hardware, software and 
leasehold improvements for the Company's software development centers in India. 
The remainder will be used for working capital and other general corporate 
purposes. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities. See ""Risk Factors--
Broad Discretion as to Use of Proceeds"" and ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" 

The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund possible 
acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses and technologies that are 
complementary to those of the Company. The Company has no specific agreements, 
commitments or understandings, and is not engaged in any negotiations, with 
respect to any acquisitions or investments. See ""Risk Factors--Risks Associated

be determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated
that the net proceeds from the sale of the Conversion Stock will be between $6.8
million and $9.3 million ($10.8 million assuming an increase in the Estimated
Valuation Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion - Stock
Pricing, Exchange Ratio and Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions
used to arrive at such amounts.

      The Company plans to contribute to Ponchatoula 50% of the net Conversion
proceeds and retain the remaining 50% of the net proceeds. The Company intends
to use a portion of the net proceeds to make a loan directly to the ESOP to
enable the ESOP to purchase up to 8% of the Conversion Stock sold in the
Offerings. Based upon the issuance of 722,500 shares or 977,500 shares at the
minimum and maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range, respectively, the loan to
the ESOP would be $578,000 and $782,000, respectively. See ""Management - New
Stock Benefit Plans - Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" The remaining net proceeds
retained by the Company initially may be used to invest in investment
securities, mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government and federal agency
securities of various maturities, deposits in either Ponchatoula or other
financial institutions, or a combination thereof. The portion of the net
proceeds retained by the Company may ultimately be used to support Ponchatoula's
lending activities, to support the future expansion of operations, and for other
business and investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special
cash dividends, possible repurchases of the Common Stock or returns of capital
(the Company and Ponchatoula have committed that no return of capital will be
made on the Common Stock during the one-year period subsequent to consummation
of the Conversion). Neither Ponchatoula nor the Company has any specific plans,
arrangements, or understandings regarding any branch acquisitions or
diversification of activities at this time.


      Following the completion of the Conversion (to the extent permitted by the
OTS), and based upon then existing facts and circumstances, the Company's Board
of Directors may determine to repurchase some shares of Common Stock, subject to
any applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Such facts and
circumstances may include but not be limited to (i) market and economic factors
such as the price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of
trading, the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the
rate of return and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the
book value and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and an
improvement in the Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination
of the Company's Board of Directors that Ponchatoula will be capitalized in
excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. The
payment of dividends or repurchase of stock, however, would be prohibited if
Ponchatoula's net worth would be reduced below the amount required for the
liquidation account to be established for the benefit of Eligible Account
Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders. As of the date of this
Prospectus, the initial balance of the liquidation account would be
approximately $5.3 million. See ""Dividend Policy,"" ""The Conversion - Liquidation
Rights"" and ""The Conversion - Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of
Shares After the Conversion.""

      The Company will be a unitary savings and loan holding company which,
under existing laws, would generally not be restricted as to the types of
business activities in which it may engage, provided that Ponchatoula continues
to be a qualified thrift lender (""QTL""). See ""Regulation - The Company"" for a
description of certain regulations applicable to the Company.

      The portion of the net proceeds contributed by the Company to Ponchatoula
will be added to Ponchatoula's general funds to be used for general corporate
purposes, including increased lending activities and purchases of securities.
While the amount of net proceeds received by Ponchatoula will further strengthen
Ponchatoula's capital position, which already substantially exceeds all
regulatory requirements, it should be noted that Ponchatoula is not converting
primarily to raise capital. After the Conversion, Ponchatoula's tangible capital
ratio will be 14.01% (based upon the midpoint of the Estimated Valuation Range).
As a result, Ponchatoula will continue to be a well-capitalized institution.
After the Conversion, Ponchatoula intends to emphasize capital strength and
growth in assets and earnings.

      The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the Conversion may be
more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the number
of shares to be issued in the Conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in the
estimated pro forma market value of Ponchatoula. Payments for shares made
through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at Ponchatoula will not
result in the receipt of new funds for investment by Ponchatoula but will result
in a reduction of Ponchatoula's interest expense and liabilities as funds are
transferred from interest-bearing certificates or other deposit accounts."

(1) The net proceeds allocated to new product development are expected to be 
applied towards the development of new lines of wallcoverings and designer

markets, including North America, Europe and Southeast Asia, and expansion of 
the Company's markets in the United States and Asia over the next 24 months. 
The proceeds are expected to be applied to market research, distributor

(4) $50,000 will be paid to the Managing Underwriter pursuant to a twenty-five

of the Offering. 

(5) The net proceeds allocated to trade payables are expected to be applied 
towards (i) payment of overdue accounts with certain suppliers which include 
The Borden Company, and Zen Wallcoverings and (ii) payments required to finance 
the increase in the Company's product inventories of Company brand 
wallcoverings and designer fabrics as well as paints and, to a lesser extent,

(6) The net proceeds allocated to working capital includes funds for general 
corporate purposes such as financing accounts receivable and payment of trade 
payables. 

The foregoing represents the Company's estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of the Offering, based upon the current status of its operations and 
anticipated business needs. It is possible, however, that the application of 
funds will differ considerably from the estimates set forth herein due to 
changes in the economic climate and/or the Company's planned business 
operations or unanticipated complications, delays and expenses, as well as any 
potential acquisitions that the Company may consummate, although no specific 
acquisition has been identified. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of

proceeds will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

Any additional net proceeds realized from the exercise of the Over-Allotment 
Option will be added to the Company's working capital. 


Pending application, the net proceeds will be invested principally in short-
term certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest-
bearing investments. 
The Company estimates that the net proceeds from this Offering will be 
sufficient to meet the Company's liquidity and working capital requirements for 
a period of 24 months from the completion of this Offering. In the event that 
the Company consummates any acquisition, although no specific acquisition has 
been identified, and no plans, proposals or arrangements currently exist in 
this regard, such funds will be derived from the funds currently allocated to

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
create a public market for the Common Stock, to facilitate future access by the 
Company to public equity markets, and to provide increased visibility and 
credibility in a marketplace where many of the Company's current and potential 
competitors are or will be publicly held companies. The Company intends to use 
a portion of the net proceeds to pay for a portion of its obligations to AOL 
and Excite pursuant to the Company's agreements with these parties, which total 
approximately $25 million over the next three years, and of which approximately 
$14 million must be paid within the next twelve months. In addition, the 
Company may, when the opportunity arises, use an unspecified portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products and 
technologies. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the 
Company expects to evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses, products 
or technologies. However, the Company has no present understandings, 
commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition or 
investment. The Company has no specific plan for use of the remaining proceeds 
and expects to use such proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
working capital to fund anticipated operating losses and capital expenditures. 
Pending use of the net proceeds for the above purposes, the Company intends to 
invest such funds in short-term, interest bearing, investment grade securities.

2002 through 2005 and two bank lines of credit bearing variable rates of 
interest (8.4% and 9.8% at March 31, 1998, respectively) which mature in 1999.
 The debt to be repaid was incurred in 1997 (approximately $1,087,000), during
 the three months ended March 31, 1998 ($2,481,000) and thereafter 
(approximately $332,000) primarily to acquire equipment. 
(2) This amount approximates taxes paid or payable by the Company's existing
 stockholders as a result of the Company's historical treatment as an S 
Corporation. See 'S Corporation Conversion.' 

The Company anticipates, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the proceeds of the Offering, together with 
projected cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its 
contemplated cash requirements for at least 12 months following the 
consummation of the Offering. 

If the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, additional 
net proceeds of $1,782,000 will be added to working capital. Pending

HLM Design intends to use approximately $3.0 million of the net proceeds to

maturing June 1, 2002, with monthly principal payments commencing June 1, 
2000), (ii) a $0.75 million term loan from Berthel Leasing, an affiliate of one of the 
Underwriters (payable July 1, 1998, with an interest rate of 12% due in monthly 
installments), and (iii) notes payable in an aggregate principal amount of $0.2 
million to employee stockholders (payable at various dates until August 2002 
including interest of 6.0%). The $3.0 million of indebtedness currently has an 
effective weighted interest cost at an annual rate equal to 23%. (In connection 
with the merger agreement between HLMI and BBH Corp. described elsewhere in 
this Prospectus and the payment of the merger consideration to holders of 
HLMI's common stock, the Company incurred indebtedness in the aggregate 
principal amount of $2 million to Pacific Capital, L.P. (""Pacific"") and 
Equitas, L.P. (""Equitas"") (the ""Pacific/Equitas Loan"") and assumed the above-

is currently anticipated to occur during the fourth quarter of 1999, assuming 
the timely and successful commercialization of VIPLAS/SD and that the Red 
Cross, the exclusive distributor of VIPLAS/SD, meets the minimum sales

discussed in ""Risk Factors--Need for Additional Funds"" and ""Management's

net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, technologies or products, no 
material transactions of this nature are currently planned or being negotiated. 

The cost, timing and amount of funds required for such uses by the Company

receipt of regulatory approvals, the progress of the Company's research and 
development and product and system commercialization programs, determinations 
as to the commercial potential and the terms of any collaborative arrangements 
entered into by the Company for the development, licensing and manufacture of 
its products and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the 
Company. Pending the application to such uses, the net proceeds will be 
invested in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. The

indebtedness incurred by Conrad under the Revolving Credit Facility (described 
below) to fund part of the cash portion of the Shareholder Distributions. See 
""Corporate Reorganization."" The remaining net proceeds will be used to repay a 
portion of the approximately $25.0 million of indebtedness under the Term Loan 
(described below) incurred by Conrad in connection with the Orange Acquisition. 

Conrad has entered into a Loan Agreement with Whitney National Bank dated as of 
May 22, 1998 (the ""Loan Agreement""), which specifies the terms of the Term Loan 
(described below) and a $10.0 million revolving credit facility which may be 
used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including 
funding of acquisitions (the ""Revolving Credit Facility""). The Revolving Credit 
Facility bears interest on the same terms as the Term Loan (described below) 
and matures on April 30, 1999. A fee of 0.25% per annum on the unused portion 
of the credit facility will be charged quarterly. Conrad recently borrowed 
approximately $10.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility in order to 
fund part of the cash portion of the Shareholder Distributions. The Company 
intends to use a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay the 
outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, which will remain 
available for future use. The Loan Agreement contains customary restrictive 
covenants and financial ratio tests, including a current ratio requirement of 
1.5 to 1.0, that could limit Conrad's use of available capacity under the 
Revolving Credit Facility. 

All of the $25.0 million of indebtedness under the term loan pursuant to the 
Loan Agreement (the ""Term Loan"") bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% until 
September 18, 1998, and thereafter at the option of Conrad at the prime rate of 
Whitney National Bank minus 0.5% or at LIBOR plus 2.0%. The Term Loan requires 
the payment of interest only until May 1998 and thereafter the Term Loan is 
payable in 70 monthly principal payments of $209,000 plus interest, with a 
final payment due in April 2004. The Term Loan currently bears interest at 
7.68% per annum. The indebtedness under the Term Loan was incurred by Conrad to 
fund the purchase price of the Orange Acquisition in December 1997, and a 
portion of the proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay a portion of the 
outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan.

Stock offered by the Company hereby, after deducting estimated underwriting 
discounts and expenses, are estimated to be approximately $38.4 million, at the 
initial public offering price of $12.50 per share. The Company expects to use 
$19.2 million to repay term indebtedness and amounts owed to related parties of 
the Merged Companies and Property Companies existing at the effectiveness of 
the Mergers and Property Acquisitions, $1.5 million to enhance its management 
information system, and the remainder for working capital and general corporate 
purposes, including acquisitions and opening new retail facilities. See 
""Formation of the Company -- The Mergers and Property Acquisitions,"" ""Certain 
Transactions -- The Mergers and Property Acquisitions -- Terms of the 
Agreements,"" ""Underwriting,"" and ""Sale of Shares to Brunswick."" 

The Company believes that undertaking the Offering at this time will facilitate 
the Company's ability to grow through the acquisition of additional 
recreational boat dealers and the opening of new retail facilities and, as 
stated above, plans to use a significant portion of the net proceeds of the 
Offering, as well as its Common Stock, for these purposes. As of the date of 
this Prospectus, however, the Company has no current or pending agreements to 
effect any acquisitions or open any new facilities. Accordingly, management 
will have substantial discretion in the use of a large portion of the net 
proceeds of the Offering to be received by the Company. The acquisitions of 
dealers and the opening of new retail facilities also generally require the 
consent of applicable manufacturers. See ""Risk Factors -- Necessity for 
Manufacturers' Consent to Dealer Acquisitions and Market Expansion."" As a 
result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that any dealer 
acquisitions or facility openings will be completed or, if completed, will be
 completed on terms favorable to the Company. Pending application of the net 
proceeds as described above, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities. See ""Business -- 
Strategy."" 

The Company will not receive any of the net proceeds from the sale of shares of 
Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. See ""Principal and Selling 
Stockholders."""

Common Stock offered by the Company hereby at an assumed initial public
offering price of $10.50 per share are estimated to be $9.5 million. The

  The Company intends to use the net proceeds to retire a revolving line of
credit in the amount of $3.4 million and a term loan in the amount of $278,000
(at March 31, 1998), for general corporate purposes, including working capital
to increase marketing and advertising, and to add personnel and other
resources to accommodate its anticipated growth. The Company may also use the
net proceeds from this offering to acquire companies or product lines that
complement the Company's existing product lines. To date, however, the Company
has not had significant discussions about or evaluated the potential
acquisition of any such companies or product lines. At March 31, 1998, the
line of credit and the term loan each bore interest at prime plus  3/4%. The
line of credit matures in April 2000 and the term loan matures in installments
through 2001."

future access by the Company to public equity markets. The Company expects to 
use the net proceeds from the Offering for the repayment of certain 
indebtedness in the approximate amount of $3.6 million and general corporate 
purposes, including working capital. The Company may also use a portion of the 
net proceeds to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or 
technologies. Although the Company may periodically review potential 
acquisition opportunities, there are no current agreements with respect to any 
such transactions. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest the net 
proceeds from the Offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
securities. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
