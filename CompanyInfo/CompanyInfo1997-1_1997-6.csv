The Company intends to pay $7.2 million of the net proceeds to the BodyBilt 
Shareholders, of which approximately $2.8 million represents the cash portion 
of the Merger Consideration and approximately $4.4 million represents the 
payment of borrowings for S corporation distribution made in connection with

certain obligations to a company wholly-owned by Mark McMillan, the President 
of BodyBilt who will become a consultant, director and principal shareholder of 
the Company, for consulting services related to the Merger and this offering. 

The Company has entered into a letter agreement with Mark McMillan pursuant to

Shareholder who will become a principal shareholder of the Company, the number 
of shares sufficient to satisfy the Company's obligation to issue shares to the 
holder of the Convertible Note upon conversion. Approximately $225,000 of the 
net proceeds of this offering will be used to fund the purchase price of the 
acquired shares, assuming a price to public of $7.00 per share. See ""Certain 
Transactions"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

approximately $250,000, plus interest, of the Convertible Note issued by

purposes. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest such funds in short-

approximately (i) $6.9 million to prepay certain senior subordinated notes (the
 ""Senior Subordinated Notes""); (ii) $1.1 million to prepay certain notes issued

million or 59.9% ($17.2 million or 65.3% if the Underwriters' over-allotment 
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds of the Offering. In addition to 
repaying debt, paying accrued preferred dividends and raising equity capital, the
 Company is conducting the Offering at this time in order to create a market for
 the Company's Common Stock, to facilitate future access by the Company to public 
equity markets, and to enhance the Company's ability to use its Common Stock as
 consideration for acquisitions and as a means of attracting and retaining key 
employees. The Company anticipates that the net proceeds of the Offering remaining 
after the repayment of debt and payment of accrued preferred dividends described
 above will be used principally for working capital and general corporate purposes,
 for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or products in the health 
care information industry and for the development of additional products. Although 
the Company continually seeks suitable acquisition candidates with complementary 
businesses and products in the health care information industry, it is not currently 
a party to any definitive agreement or letter of intent regarding any acquisition;
 as a result, the Company cannot precisely determine the timing or relative size 
of any potential acquisition. The cost, timing and amounts of funds required for 
the uses of the remaining net proceeds of the Offering are in management's discretion,
 will depend upon business conditions as and when appropriate uses develop and,
 consequently, cannot be precisely determined by the Company at this time. Pending 
the application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends to
 invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.
The Senior Subordinated Notes are held by HealthPlan Services Corporation (""HPSC"") 
and were issued pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated January 8,
 1996, between the Company and HPSC (the ""Securities Purchase Agreement""). 
Senior Subordinated Notes bear interest at a nominal rate of 10% per annum and
 an effective rate of 10.9% per annum and mature on January 8, 2003, subject to
 certain provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement that require the 
prepayment of the Senior Subordinated Notes upon the occurrence of certain 
events, including the closing of an initial public offering. The proceeds from
 the sale of the Senior Subordinated Notes were used to fund the acquisition of 
Formations and PracticeMatch. When the Company issued the Senior Subordinated
 Notes, it issued to HPSC warrants to purchase an aggregate of 298,150 shares 
of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.015 per share and recorded the 
estimated fair value of these warrants, $573,000, as a discount on the issuance
 of debt at the time of their issuance. As a result of the application of a 
portion of the net proceeds to repay this indebtedness, the Company will incur
 a one-time, noncash charge of approximately $795,000 with respect to the 
accelerated amortization of such discount and of related deferred financing 
costs, which charge will be recorded in the period in which the Offering is 
completed. 
The Acquisition Notes are held by the former shareholders of PracticeMatch and
 were issued to them as partial consideration for the Company's purchase of the
 stock of PracticeMatch. The Acquisition Notes bear interest at the rate of 10%
 per annum. Of the principal amount of the Acquisition Notes, 30% is payable on
 April 1, 1997, with the balance due September 14, 1997, subject to the terms of
 the stock purchase agreement pursuant to which such Acquisition Notes were issued,
 which effectively require their prepayment upon the prepayment of the Senior 
Subordinated Notes. 
The Bridge Loan is held by NationsBank and was incurred in the fourth quarter of 
1996 pursuant to a promissory note, which, as amended to date, permits aggregate 
borrowings of up to $850,000, of which $507,000 was outstanding on January 28,
 1997. The Bridge Loan bears interest at NationsBank's prime rate plus 2% per 
annum and matures upon the earlier of completion of the Offering or March 31, 
1997. The Bridge Loan was established to extinguish debt assumed in connection
 with the PracticeMatch acquisition, and the remainder of the Bridge Loan is 
available for general corporate purposes.

Stock being offered by the Company hereby (after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of $1.75 million) 
are estimated to be $45.7 million. Of these proceeds, the Company currently 
expects to allocate approximately $12.0 million to support expansion of the 
Company's operations, including the opening of sales offices in new geographic 
markets as well as in established markets and, as favorable opportunities arise,
expansion of the Company's client base in new or existing markets through an 
acquisition of an existing PEO office. The Company believes that this allocation
will be sufficient to fund the Company's expansion plans through 1997 and 1998. 
In addition, the Company intends to utilize approximately $7.2 million of such 
proceeds as follows: (i) $4.0 million to repay all of its 13% Subordinated Notes
(the ""Notes"") held by the Board of Trustees of the Texas Growth Fund, as Trustee
for the Texas Growth Fund-1991 Trust (""TGF""), (ii) approximately $2.5 million 
to exercise its option to repurchase 348,945 shares of Common Stock from 
Pyramid Ventures, Inc. (""PVI"") and its option to repurchase 173,609 warrants to 
purchase shares of Common Stock from TGF, and (iii) approximately $0.7 million 
to retire the current balances of certain secured loans (the ""Secured Loans"") 
incurred in connection with the purchase of real estate for the Company's 
headquarters. The balance of the proceeds (estimated to be approximately $26.5 
million), will be used for working capital purposes, which may include 
acquisitions of existing PEO operations should favorable acquisition 
opportunities arise. The Company does not have any agreement, arrangement or 
understanding regarding acquisitions of existing PEO operations or any amounts 
budgeted for such acquisitions, and any funds expended on such acquisitions 
would be in addition to funds expended in conjunction with the Company's 
expansion plans. Pending the application of such funds, the Company intends to 
invest the net proceeds of this offering in diversified, highly-liquid, 
investment grade, interest-bearing instruments. 

The Notes, which are to be redeemed pursuant to optional prepayment provisions, 
mature in May 1999 and accrue interest at an annual rate of 13% payable 
quarterly. The Secured Loans consist of three separate notes ranging from 
$73,000 to $462,000 in outstanding principal amount, with payments aggregating 
from approximately $11,000 to $84,000 annually, and with interest rates ranging 
from approximately 8.4% to 9.25% as of September 30, 1996. See Note 3 of Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for the Interim Period Ended 
September 30, 1996.

Based on the $15.0 million figure, the net proceeds of this offering have been 
tentatively allocated by the Company to be used to: (i) increase the Company's 
research and development efforts in a number of cancer treatment applications 
($2.2 million); (ii) continue to expand clinical trials for the PRS ($1.7 
million); (iii) obtain regulatory approvals for the PRS ($3.2 million); (iv)

Dividends on the Bank Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears and are 
calculated on the $10.00 subscription price at a floating rate equal to 1% 
above the United States Treasury Bill rate. Dividends are noncumulative, and 
the Bank is prohibited from paying any cash dividends on its common stock unless
all dividends on the Bank Preferred Stock have been paid in full for all

a liquidation preference of $10.00, and holders of the Bank Preferred Stock 
have no voting rights except in certain limited circumstances. The terms of the 
Bank Preferred Stock provide that it may be redeemed by the Bank at any time on

The Company anticipates that approximately $24 million of the proceeds of this
 offering will be used to support the development of its B-1 Therapy, including
 clinical trials, manufacturing and initial prelaunch marketing. The balance of
 the net proceeds of this offering, including interest earned thereon, is expected 
to be used primarily in the Company's other research and development programs 
such as its TAP pro-drug program and for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to

 material expenditures in connection with any such acquisitions currently are
 anticipated. Pending application as described above, the Company intends to
 invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing securities. 
The amounts and timing of the Company's actual expenditure for the purposes
 described above will depend upon a number of factors, including: the scope and
 results of preclinical studies and clinical trials; continued progress of the 
Company's research and development of potential products; the cost, timing and
 outcome of regulatory approvals; the expenses of establishing a sales and 
marketing force; the timing and cost of establishment or procurement of 
requisite production, radiolabeling and other manufacturing capacities; the
 cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and
 enforcing patent claims; the acquisition of technology licenses; the status
 of competitive products and the availability of other financing. The Company
 will require substantial additional funds to conduct its operations in the
 future, and there can be no assurance that such funding will be available on
 acceptable terms, if at all. The Company expects that its existing capital
 resources, including the net proceeds of this offering and interest thereon,
 will be adequate to satisfy the requirements of its current and planned

(1) The Company currently owes Charles P. Torrey, Jr. $65,000, Richard S. 
Cooper $66,773 and Robert L. Remine $120,000, each plus accrued interest at the 
rate of 10% per annum in the aggregate amount of approximately $25,227, 
pursuant to certain promissory notes. These promissory notes are scheduled to 
mature on demand. The proceeds of these loans were used by the Company for 
working capital. 

(2) Accrued dividends at 5% on the Company's Class A Preferred Stock are 
payable in cash upon the completion of this Offering. At such time, all shares 
of Preferred Stock will be automatically converted to Common Stock on a one 
share-to-one share conversion ratio. 

(3) To be used to explore for, acquire and develop natural gas and oil 
reserves. At least 65% of the net proceeds of the Offering are expected to be 
used by the Company for development of the Company's Beaver Coal Company Lease 
and any current or later acquired leases in such area; as well as for 
development of the Company's Dupont Field, and any extensions thereof, in Wood 
County, West Virginia; and the Company's Torch and Bartlett Field, and any 
extensions thereof, in or around the area serviced by the Gas Gathering System 
operated by the Company. 

The foregoing represents the best estimate by the Company of its use of net 
proceeds based upon present planning and business conditions. The proposed 
application of proceeds is subject to change as market and financial conditions 
change. The Company, therefore, has reserved the right to vary its use of 
proceeds in response to unanticipated events which may arise. 

Pending use, it is anticipated that the proceeds to the Company resulting from 
this Offering will be primarily invested in short-term, investment grade 
obligations or insured bank certificates of deposit. It is anticipated that the 
net proceeds of this Offering will satisfy the financial needs of the Company 
for 18 to 24 months following the date of this Prospectus. See ""Business -- 
Business Plan"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

Management has not definitively identified the uses of the net proceeds which 
are allocated to working capital reserves. While it is presently anticipated 
that these funds will be used, in part, for development of the Beaver Coal 
Company Lease, other developmental drilling activities elsewhere in 
southeastern Ohio and West Virginia, or acquisitions of oil and gas properties, 
the net proceeds will ultimately be applied as business opportunities present 
themselves."

A Common Stock offered hereby (after deducting underwriting discounts and

$59.5 million ($68.6 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full). 

The Company plans to use a portion of the net proceeds of this Offering to pay 
the purchase price and repay indebtedness incurred in connection with recently 
completed acquisitions, in the aggregate amount of approximately $10.1 million, 
including (i) a promissory note in the amount of $8.4 million, payable by the 
Company to Ag Capital, which bears interest at the prime rate (8.25% as of 
December 31, 1996) and matures on February 28, 1997, incurred in connection 
with the Central Texas Acquisition, and (ii) a promissory note in the amount of 
$1.7 million, payable by the Company to Ag Capital, which bears interest at the 
prime rate and matures February 28, 1997, incurred in connection with the 
Washington Acquisition. See ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."" 
The Company also plans to use a portion of the net proceeds of this Offering to 
pay an aggregate distribution of approximately $15.0 million to the existing 
stockholders of the Company of substantially all of the previously 
undistributed, accumulated net income of the Company as of January 31, 1996. 
See ""S Corporation Distributions."" 

The Company plans to use the balance of the net proceeds of approximately $34.4 
million ($43.5 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised 
in full) to finance future acquisitions, new stores, and internal growth and 
for other general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Company 
intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they arise and 
expects that future acquisitions primarily will consist of existing Deere 
agricultural and industrial dealers. The Company also may consider acquisitions 
of complementary businesses, such as equipment rental operations. The Company 
has entered into a letter of intent to acquire certain assets of an industrial 
equipment rental company with five locations in Arizona. If this contemplated 
acquisition is completed, the Company would expect to use approximately $2.4 
million of the net proceeds of this Offering and assume certain liabilities. 
See ""Business--Recent and Contemplated Acquisitions."" This contemplated 
acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including the negotiation and 
execution of a definitive agreement and the completion of due diligence. There 
can be no assurance that such conditions will be fulfilled or that the 
contemplated acquisition will be consumated. 

The Company currently is not a party to any other agreement or understanding 
with respect to other possible acquisitions. 

Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this Offering will be used to reduce 
borrowings under the Company's lines of credit, including its floor plan 
financing with Deere or indebtedness to Ag Capital, each of which bears interest
at the prime rate (8.25% as of December 31, 1996)."

(1) Represents amounts to be used to establish the Company's recorded music business,
 including a minimum of $800,000 in the first year following the Offering for
 the establishment of the Company's record label, which amount includes the 
base salary of one of the Executives, anticipated artist advances, salaries for
 additional employees, recording costs and promotion and marketing expenses. The
 Company currently plans to allocate up to an additional $800,000 to its record
 label in the 12-month period following the first year of the Offering. Any
 amounts not allocated for the establishment of the Company's record label may
 be allocated to any additional record labels that may be acquired pursuant to
 the acquisition program. There can be no assurance that the Company will 
operate more than one record label. If no additional record labels are acquired,
 a portion of this amount may be transferred to working capital. If operating
 revenue from the recorded music subsidiary is not sufficient to meet its 
expenses, the Company will allocate additional funds out of working capital and
 general corporate purposes to help pay such expenses. See ""Business--Development 
of Recorded Music Business."" 
(2) Represents amounts to be used for implementing the Company's acquisition 
program, including amounts to be used for acquiring entities and assets in
 accordance with the acquisition program and costs and expenses incurred in
 connection with the acquisition program. See ""Business--Acquisition Program."" 
(3) Represents $200,000 to be used for expanding each of the Company's existing
 businesses, including upgrading facilities and equipment (other than new recording 
studio equipment) and expanding marketing and promotion. See ""Business--Current
 Business."" 
(4) Represents amounts to be used for new recording studio equipment. 
(5) Represents amounts to be used for working capital and general corporate 
purposes including corporate overhead, administration and ongoing professional
 fees. Does not include any amounts for base salaries or payments to any of the 
Company's Outside Directors (as herein defined), since, other than the base 
salary for one of the Executives, base salaries (including base salaries for the 
other Executives) and amounts payable to Outside Directors will be paid from 
operating revenue. Includes an aggregate of $275,000 in advance of possible 
future bonus compensation payable to John Loeffler, Jon Small, Brian Doyle and 
Richard Flynn which amounts will be repaid if they are not earned. 
The allocation of the net proceeds from the Offering set forth above represents
 the Company's best estimates based upon its currently proposed plans and 
assumptions relating to its operations (including assumptions regarding the 
timing and costs associated with the establishment of the Company's record 
label and costs associated with the acquisition program) and certain assumptions 
regarding general economic conditions. If any of these factors change, the 
Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds
 within the above-described categories or to use portions thereof for other 
purposes. Any such shifts in the use of proceeds will be at the discretion of
 the Company. Upon completion of the Offering, the Company believes that net
 proceeds of the Offering, together with the Company's current cash and anticipated 
cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to fund its operations, including
 the expenses of its current businesses, its entrance into the recorded music
 industry and the acquisition program, for the 12-month period following the 
date of this Prospectus. Even if the Offering is successfully completed, cash
 generated from operations may not be sufficient to fund the Company's requirements 
beyond such 12-month period. Under such circumstances or if the Company otherwise 
requires additional funding, the Company would need to raise additional cash 
through the sale of equity or debt securities or obtain bank or other financing.
 The Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, additional 
financing, and there can be no assurance that additional financing, including 
any institutional financing, will be available to the Company if needed on 
commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any inability to obtain additional 
financing when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company,
 including requiring the Company to significantly curtail or possibly cease its
 operations. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 
If the Representative exercises the Over-Allotment Option in full, the Company
 will realize additional net proceeds (after deducting the underwriting discounts 
and the Representative's nonaccountable expense allowance) of $783,000. If the
 Warrants offered hereby are exercised, the Company will realize proceeds relating 
thereto of approximately $3,600,000, before any solicitation fees which may be
 paid in connection therewith. Such additional proceeds, if received, are expected
 to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. See ""Underwriting.""
 Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be

None of the net proceeds of the Offering are specifically designated for 
payments to officers or directors. Although SEEC has no current understandings, 
commitments or agreements, and is not currently engaged in any negotiations, 
with respect to any acquisition transaction, a portion of the proceeds may be 
used for the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies. 
Pending such uses, SEEC intends to invest the net proceeds from this Offering 
in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. Management 
believes that cash flow from operations and the net proceeds of the Offering 
will be sufficient to meet the Company's future cash flow needs for at least 
one year following the Offering."

offered hereby are estimated to be approximately $23,580,000 ($27,207,000 if 
the Underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full) after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable 
by the Company. 

EarthLink expects to use the net proceeds of this Offering to finance sales and 
marketing activities, leasehold improvements, investments in network equipment, 
information systems and office equipment. In addition, the Company expects to 
use the net proceeds for new service introductions and for working capital and 
other general corporate purposes. The Company also intends to use a portion of 
the net proceeds of this Offering to repay certain outstanding indebtedness. As 
of November 30, 1996, approximately $2.95 million was outstanding under the 10% 
Promissory Notes (which mature in June 1997). The holders of $725,000 of such 
notes have agreed to convert such indebtedness into 55,767 shares of Common 
Stock upon consummation of this Offering. The balance, approximately $2.23 
million as of November 30, 1996, will be repaid using a portion of the net 
proceeds of the Offering. The Company also intends to repay all outstanding 
indebtedness under a promissory note issued to UUNET (which, as of November 30, 
1996, had a principal balance of $5.0 million and accrued interest of 
approximately $42,700), unless UUNET decides to convert the note into Common 
Stock prior to repayment. The note bears interest at a floating rate of prime 
plus 2% per annum, and matures in October 1997. See ""Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and 
Capital Resources"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 

The amounts actually expended for each purpose, other than repayment of the 
indebtedness described above, will be determined at the discretion of the 
Company's management. The Company's future capital requirements and the 
allocation of the net proceeds of this Offering will depend on many factors, 
including the rate of market acceptance of the Company's services, the 
Company's ability to expand and maintain its customer base, the rate of 
expansion of the Company's network infrastructure, the level of resources 
required to expand the Company's marketing and sales organization, information 
systems and research and development activities, the availability of hardware 
and software provided by third-party vendors and other factors. The Company 
also anticipates that it may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire 
complementary product and service lines, technology, equipment, other companies 
or interests in other companies. While the Company from time to time has 
engaged in preliminary discussions concerning possible acquisitions, 
investments or joint ventures, it has no present understandings, commitments, 
agreements or active negotiations with respect to any such transaction. 

Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this Offering will be invested in 
government securities or short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing 
securities. The Company believes that the net proceeds from this Offering, 
together with other available cash, will be sufficient to meet the Company's 
operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.

Bridge Notes are converted, the net proceeds that would have been used to repay 
indebtedness under such Bridge Notes will be used for general working capital 
purposes. The outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Bridge Notes 
will be due and payable within 30 days after the date of this Prospectus and 
bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum. Up to 100% of the principal amount 
of the Bridge Notes is convertible for a period of 20 days after the date of 
this Prospectus, at the option of the holder thereof, into the Company's Common 
Stock at a conversion price of 80% of the initial public offering price. The 
proceeds from the Bridge Notes were used to finance the Company's acquisitions, 
to repay $100,000 of short-term debt and for general working capital purposes. 
See ""Description of Securities -- Bridge Financing."" 

REPAYMENT OF SHORT-TERM DEBT. The Company currently maintains a line of credit 
of $1,000,000 with Imperial Bank for working capital purposes. This line 
consists of a $500,000 revolving line of credit from the California Export 
Financing Office that bears interest at the prime rate plus 1.5% and is payable 
in April 1997 and a $500,000 revolving line of credit that bears interest at an 
annual rate equal to the prime rate plus 2% and is payable in April 1997. As of 
September 30, 1996, the outstanding balance of this loan was $500,000. This 
line of credit requires an annual short-term repayment before it can be renewed.
 The Company plans to use $1,000,000 of the proceeds of this offering to repay 
the line of credit, and to renew the line of credit for use in the future. 
See ""Certain Transactions."" 

As of September 30, 1996, the Company owed Peninsula Bank $263,000 under a loan 
payable in January 1997. This loan is collateralized with assets pledged by 
William S. Potter, a director of the Company. The Company plans to use $263,000 
of the proceeds of the offering to repay this loan and to cause the release of 
this director's collateral. The Company also plans to repay $500,000 of 
unsecured demand notes bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum from 
directors William B. Adams and Douglas M. Gloff, and from Heartland Capital 
Fund, Ltd. (""Heartland Capital""), a limited partnership of which Bradley K. 
Edwards, a director of the Company, is a general partner. See ""Certain 
Transactions."" All of the proceeds from this short-term debt were used for 
working capital purposes. 

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. The Company currently intends to use approximately 
$1,000,000 of the net proceeds for capital expenditures, primarily related to 
the construction of additional BioJect systems to satisfy current and future 
customer orders. 

WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. The remainder of the net 
proceeds, approximately $1,237,000, will be allocated to working capital and 
will be used to (i) add customer service and installation personnel necessary 
to support expansion of the Company's customer base in existing territories and 
in new markets (such as the agricultural crop, soil remediation and water 
quality management industries), (ii) finance the growth of receivables and 
inventory as revenues expand, thereby reducing dependence on the Company's bank 
line of credit, (iii) finance the growth in capital expenditures that occurs as 
the installed base of BioJect systems increases without being dependent on 
obtaining outside financing, and (iv) provide working capital to expand into 
potential new geographical territories. 

Pending the use of the net proceeds, the Company intends to invest such funds 
in interest-bearing money market funds, short-term certificates of deposit and 
United States governmental obligations. The described use of proceeds is based 
upon management's assumptions concerning marketing, selling, development, 
financial and other matters which may affect the Company. If the development of 
the Company's business varies materially from these assumptions, the Company 
may reallocate the use of proceeds in such a manner as it deems appropriate 
under the circumstances."

Stock and the 750,000 Warrants offered hereby, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and estimated offering expenses, including the non-accountable 
expense allowance, are estimated to be approximately $3,572,000 ($4,169,000 if 
the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the initial 
public offering price of $6.00 per share of Common Stock and $0.10 per Warrant. 
The Company expects to use between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000 of the net proceeds
 to partially fund the purchase or construction of an Improved Facility and to 
purchase additional capital equipment. In addition, the Company expects that it 
will use approximately $300,000 for promotions to Supermarkets and Institutional
Purchasers, increased consumer advertising and to secure additional shelf space 
in Supermarkets. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds to either
acquire, or enter into joint ventures with, companies producing complementary 
food products. Although the Company evaluates potential acquisitions and joint 
ventures on an on-going basis, the Company currently has no agreements, 
understandings or commitments with respect to any acquisition or joint venture, 
nor is the Company engaged in negotiations with respect to any acquisition or 
joint venture. There can be no assurance that the Company will complete any 
acquisitions or enter into any joint ventures, that such acquisitions or joint 
ventures will be profitable or that future acquisitions or joint ventures will 
not materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations or 
financial condition. See ""Risk Factors -- Risks Associated with Purchase or 
Construction of Improved Facility,"" "" -- Broad Discretion in Application of 
Proceeds,"" "" -- Risks Associated with Acquisition Strategy and Acquisitions 
Outside the Company's Market Niche,"" ""Business -- Growth Strategy"" and "" --

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the use of the net 
proceeds to be received in this offering based on its current growth plans and 
business conditions. The Company reserves the right to change such use when and 
if market conditions or unexpected changes in operating conditions or results 
occur. The amounts actually expended for each use may vary significantly 
depending upon a number of factors, including future sales growth and the amount
of cash generated by the Company's operations. The Company intends to use the 
net proceeds of this offering to temporarily repay a portion of the Company's 
indebtedness under its Bank Credit Facilities except the $247,025 subject to the
subordinated participations in the term loan facility under the Bank Credit 
Facilities held by certain Company shareholders. Any net proceeds not used for 
this purpose will be invested in short-term interest-bearing securities. 
The Company anticipates a significant short-term savings in interest expense as 
a result of this temporary repayment of debt. The interest rate on the Bank 
Credit Facilities is 5/8% over ANB's prime rate. The Company anticipates 
borrowing, as needed, under its Bank Credit Facilities for the purposes 
described above. Accordingly, investors will not know with certainty how the 
Company will use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of the offering. 
The Company anticipates, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the net proceeds of this offering, together 
with projected cash flow from operations and existing capital resources, 
including its Bank Credit Facilities, will be sufficient to fund the Company's 
operations for at least 12 to 18 months following the consummation of this 
offering. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

(3) To be used for general operating and overhead expenses including the 
installation of a management information system ($50,000), establishing a 
network of brokers and manufacturers representatives ($10,000), hiring of 
additional administrative, sales, production and warehouse employees ($150,000) 
and the funding of raw material inventory. In the event of exercise of the 
Over-Allotment Option, the Company will be required to pay the Underwriters an 
additional non-accountable expense allowance in the amount of $27,000 and 
working capital will be reduced accordingly. 

The amounts set forth above are estimates. Should a reapportionment or 
redirection of funds be determined to be in the best interests of the Company, 
the actual amount expended to finance any category of expenses may be increased 
or decreased by the Company's Board of Directors, at its discretion. 

The Company believes that the proceeds of this Offering will enable the Company 
to increase its annual revenues through the expansion of its business and 
customer base. As a result, the Company believes that the net proceeds of this 
Offering, together with increased revenues generated from operations, will be 
sufficient to conduct the Company's operations for at least twelve (12) months. 
The terms of the underwriting agreement between the Company and the 
Underwriters restrict the Company from entering into any acquisition or merger 
of the Company or obtaining additional capital financing, without the prior 
approval of the Representative, for the issuance of additional equity 
securities for a period of two (2) years, in either public or private 
offerings. The underwriting agreement does not prevent the Company from seeking 
bank financing although there can be no assurance that such financing will be 
available on commercially reasonable terms. See 'Risk Factors-- Dependence on 
Offering Proceeds; Possible Need for Additional Financing.' 

To the extent that the Company's expenditures are less than projected, the 
resulting balances will be retained and used for general working capital 
purposes. Conversely, to the extent that such expenditures require the 
utilization of funds in excess of the amounts anticipated and/or the proceeds 
of this Offering decrease as a result of expense payable by the Company in 
connection with the exercise by the Underwriters of their Over-Allotment 
Option, additional financing may be sought from other sources, such as debt 
financing from financial institutions, although there can be no assurance that 
such additional financing, if available, will be on terms acceptable to the 
Company. 

See 'Risk Factors--Dependence on Offering Proceeds; Possible Need For 
Additional Financing.' The net proceeds of this Offering that are not expended 
immediately may be deposited in interest bearing accounts, or invested in

offering price of $16.50 per share are estimated to be approximately $35.0

funds to the Joint Venture to be used to repay approximately $11.5 million of 
indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility that currently bears 
interest at 8% and matures on June 1, 1998 and to repay approximately $1.3 
million of subordinated indebtedness to Mr. James C. Calaway that currently 
bears interest at 10% and matures on April 8, 1998. The remainder of the net 
proceeds will be used to provide working capital to the Company and for general 
corporate purposes, including funding the Company's exploration, development 
and acquisition activities. Following application of the proceeds of this 
Offering, the Company anticipates that its only long-term indebtedness will 
consist of an aggregate of approximately $412,000 principal amount of equipment 
loans. The indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility and the 
indebtedness to Mr. James C. Calaway was used primarily for the Company's

of Common Stock offered hereby are estimated to be $9,300,000 ($10,695,000 if
the Underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deduction
of the underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting estimated
offering expenses of $200,000.  The Underwriter has agreed that no underwriting
discounts or commissions will be incurred by the Company up to 300,000 shares
sold by the Underwriter to members of the Board of Directors, their immediate
families or certain other designated individuals.  If such persons purchase
300,000 shares, underwriting discounts and commissions will be reduced by, and
proceeds to the Company will be increased by $210,000.
        The Company expects to contribute approximately $7.5 million of the net
proceeds of the offering to the Bank by purchasing all of the Bank's common
stock to be issued.  This purchase of the Bank's stock is intended to provide
the Bank with the capital required by regulators to commence operations.  The
Bank plans to use approximately $30,000  for leasehold improvements and
$350,000 to purchase furniture, fixtures and equipment and other necessary
assets for the Bank's operations.  The Company expects to use approximately
$120,000 of the net proceeds to pay for preopening and organizational expenses
of the Bank.  These preopening and organizational costs were financed on an
interim basis from loans made to the Company by certain of the Bank's
organizers. It is anticipated that these loans will be repaid by the Company
promptly following the completion of the offering. Preopening income may offset
some of these expenses.  It is currently anticipated that the balance of the
net proceeds received by the Bank will be used to fund investments in loans and
securities and for payment of operating expenses.  The remaining net proceeds
(plus any net proceeds as a result of the exercise of the Underwriter's
over-allotment option) initially will be invested by the Company in investment
grade securities and otherwise held by the Company as working capital for
general corporate purposes and to pay operating expenses, as well as for
possible future capital contributions to the Bank. The funds will also be
available to finance possible acquisitions of other branches or expansion into
other lines of business closely related to banking, although the Company
presently has no plans to do so."

Stock offered hereby are estimated to be approximately $27,300,000 
($31,485,000 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), 
based on the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share and after 
deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated expenses of this offering 
payable by the Company. 

The Company is undertaking this offering, and expects to use a majority of the 
net proceeds therefrom, to fund its research and development activities, which 
may include the formation of joint ventures and other collaborative 
relationships. The amount and timing of the net proceeds allocated to specific 
research and development activities will depend upon numerous factors, such as 
the progress of the Company's drug development programs, the receipt of 
necessary regulatory approvals, the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, 
maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual 
property rights, the status of competitive products and technologies and the 
timing and availability of alternative methods of financing for the Company, 
including existing or future strategic alliances and joint ventures with third 
parties. The Company's research and development expenditures will vary as product candidates, if any, are added or abandoned or as additional collaborations are established. In addition, the Company intends to use some of the proceeds of this offering to expand its CRO services through internal growth, including acquisition of information technology and expansion of existing facilities, the acquisitions of other businesses and the formation of contract research service joint ventures and other strategic collaborations. The Company intends to use the remainder of the proceeds of this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company has not determined the amount it plans to spend for each purpose or the timing of such expenditures. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds from this offering in United States government securities and investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments. The Company expects to continue to be able to avoid the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ""1940 Act""). If the Company were required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, it would become subject to substantial regulations with respect to its capital structure, management, operations, transactions with affiliates (as defined in the 1940 Act), and other matters. Application of the provisions of the 1940 Act would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company investigates, evaluates and 
discusses with others the potential creation of strategic collaborations and 
the acquisition of businesses, technologies and compounds which complement the 
Company's business. Although the Company currently has no definitive 
understandings or agreements with respect to any such strategic collaboration 
or acquisition, the Company is actively engaged in discussions with several 
parties which may either singly or in the aggregate materially impact the 
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, and the net 
proceeds from this offering may be used for such purpose. No assurance can be 
given, however, that any such strategic collaboration or acquisition will be 
made or, if made, that it will prove to be successful. 

The Company believes that the estimated net proceeds of this offering, its 
collaborative agreements with strategic partners, its contract research 
services and existing cash, cash equivalents and investments and marketable 
securities will satisfy its cash requirements through 1999 based on the 
Company's current operating plan and conditions, but there can be no assurance 
that the Company will not require, or choose to raise, additional funds prior 
to such date."

     MARKETING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT. The Company plans to develop a marketing
team which will require the hiring of approximately four additional individuals
along with a technical product support staff consisting of three new people. The
use of proceeds assumes all anticipated salaries and benefits related to such
individuals, along with marketing and technical support expenses related
thereto.
     INVENTORY AND COMPONENTS. The Company plans to purchase inventory component
parts to be supplied to optics and assembly board subcontractors. This approach
is anticipated so that the Company can maintain supply of components to meet
anticipated increasing demand for its products and to retain control over the
quality and consistency of the subcontracted products assembled.
     ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. The Company plans to engage an
experienced Controller and expand its support personnel in the areas of
procurement, data processing, accounting, and other administration. In addition,
because of the anticipated expanded activity level of the Company in the near
term and increased reporting obligations related to securities law compliance,
the Company intends to continue to utilize external professional legal and
accounting consultants and advisors, and also intends to make use of
professional services in the areas of investor and public relations.
     RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. Due to anticipated demand for product
enhancements, interfacing requirements, and options, along with the need for
ongoing new product development, the Company plans to continue its research and
development efforts and plans to hire two additional technical personnel to
support these efforts.
     SALES PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES. The Company currently plans to implement a
comprehensive sales program utilizing various forms of promotional activities
including telemarketing, trade show attendance, and the development of media
kits and other promotional literature for distribution.
     REPAYMENT OF NOTES PAYABLE. The Company intends to use a portion of the
proceeds to repay amounts expected to be outstanding under its line of credit
agreement with a bank of $250,000. This agreement bears interest at 1% above the
prime rate of interest and expires in January 1998. In addition, the Company
intends to use a portion of the proceeds to repay a $117,000 note to Richard T.
Fiskum, the President, Chief Operating Officer, and a Director of the Company.
This note (i) does not bear any interest, (ii) originated in connection with an
August 1995 purchase of optics technology from Mr. Fiskum, and (iii) is
collateralized by a $117,000 account receivable from Jasper. See ""Certain
Transactions.""
     PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT. Due to anticipated increased product demands, the 
Company intends to add appropriate production and assembly management personnel. 
     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. The Company intends to purchase ""pick and place"" 
semi-automated assembly line components to meet additional prototype-pre- 
production testing requirements of new products during 1997 and 1998, as well as
other general capital expenditures. 
     CONTRACT ASSEMBLY. The Company plans to utilize existing optics and PCB 
assembly subcontractors to assemble its fifth generation populated PC board and 
optics reader. 
     PRODUCT REGISTRATION AND CALIBRATION. The Company plans to increase 
personnel to perform program registration and optics calibration for Company 
products. 
     WORKING CAPITAL. The remaining net proceeds from the offering will be used 
for general working capital purposes, including financing of accounts 
receivable, along with the payment of salaries and increased overhead expenses 
related to the anticipated expansion of the Company's operations. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its allocation of the 
net proceeds of this offering, based upon the current state of its business 
operations, its current plans and current economic and industry conditions. 
These estimates are subject to change based upon material factors such as 
unanticipated levels and types of competition, adverse market trends and new 
business opportunities. Any material revisions in the allocation of proceeds 
will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company believes 
the net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to meet the Company's 
capital needs through approximately mid-1998. Pending the use of the proceeds 
of this offering, the company intends to invest the proceeds in short-term, high
quality, interest-bearing instruments. If the Underwriter exercises the over-
allotment option in full, the Company will realize additional net proceeds of 
$590,700. Such additional net proceeds will be added to the Company's working 
capital."

Company's term loan incurred primarily to acquire capital equipment and (iii) 
$0.1 million of outstanding capital lease obligations. The promissory notes 
executed to finance the Woodholly Acquisition bear interest at 8.0% per annum 
and are payable in February 1997. The amounts outstanding under the term loan 
bear interest at the London Interbank Offering Rate plus 2.5% and are payable 
in monthly installments through July 2000. The Company expects to distribute 
$4.5 million of the net proceeds (the ""S Corp distribution"") to the Company's 
current shareholders at the close of this Offering in respect of previously 
taxed and undistributed earnings of the Company. The amount of the S Corp 
distribution will be subject to adjustment based upon final calculation of the 
Company's results for the period prior to the close of this Offering. 
Purchasers of Common Stock will not participate in the S Corp distribution. 

The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general 
corporate purposes, including the potential acquisition of businesses 
complementary to the Company's operations, and for capital expenditures. Other 
than with respect to the Woodholly Acquisition, the Company currently has no 
commitments or agreements to acquire any particular business. Pending such 
uses, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds in short-term investment 
grade, interest-bearing securities, certificates of deposit or guaranteed 
obligations of the United States of America. See ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and

(1) The amount set forth with respect to each purpose represents the Company's 
current estimate of the approximate amount of the net proceeds that will be 
used for such purpose. However, the Company reserves the right to change the 
amount of such net proceeds that will be used for any purpose to the extent 
that management determines that such change is advisable. Consequently, 
management of the Company will have broad discretion in determining the manner 
in which the net proceeds of the Offering are applied. 

(2) The notes issued in connection with the Bridge Financing (the ""Bridge 
Notes"") are in the aggregate principal amount of $1.1 million, bear interest at 
the rate of 12% per annum, and are payable upon the earlier of the closing of 
the Offering or June 30, 1997. The net proceeds from the sale of the Bridge 
Notes were used for the development of additional Integrated Medical Centers, 
for the expenses of this Offering, and for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. Through February 14, 1997, the amount of accrued interest 
to be repaid is approximately $71,000. See ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and 
Capital Resources."" 

(3) The Company intends to develop approximately 63 additional Integrated 
Medical Centers (including the 59 for which it had agreements with 
chiropractors as of January 31, 1997) within the 12 months after the date of 
this Prospectus, of which one is expected to be developed in connection with a 
strategic alliance. The average cost to the Company to develop an Integrated 
Medical Center not connected with a strategic alliance is approximately 
$30,000. This cost has consisted of approximately $10,000 for the purchase of 
computer software, legal fees, professional credentialing, training, an 
administrative starter kit, and travel and approximately $20,000 (out of a 
possible $40,000) in the form of a loan. The loan may be used for items such as 
professional salaries, computer hardware, signage, and insurance. The Company 
believes that the average cost to the Company to develop an Integrated Medical 
Center in connection with a strategic alliance will be approximately $150,000. 
These funds are expected to be used for leasehold improvements, equipment, 
professional salaries, information systems, and working capital. See 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations -- General."" 

(4) Consists of accrued payroll, accrued expenses, convertible note payable in 
the principal amount of $25,000 (plus accrued interest), and certain other 
indebtedness of the Company. 

(5) The remaining portion of the net proceeds allocated to working capital will 
be used by the Company to fund operations as required including amounts 
required to pay officers' salaries, professional fees, office-related expenses, 
costs associated with upgrading its management information system, and other 
corporate expenses. The additional net proceeds received from the exercise of 
the Overallotment Option, if any, will be used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. 

The Company anticipates, based on current plans and assumptions relating to its 
operations, that the net proceeds of the Offering, together with net cash from 
operations, should be sufficient to satisfy the Company's cash requirements for 
at least the 12 months after the date of this Prospectus. Proceeds not 
immediately required for the purposes described above will be invested in short-
term, investment grade, interest-bearing government obligations."

Underwriters' over-allotment is exercised in full), after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by the Company. 

The Company expects to use approximately $4 million of the net proceeds from 
this Offering to fund research and development, including clinical trials and 
approximately $4 million to fund the expansion of the Company's sales and 
marketing force to commercially market its products in the United States and 
internationally. The balance of the net proceeds will be used for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes. These amounts are estimates, and 
the amount and timing of the expenditures of the net proceeds for these 
purposes will depend on numerous factors, including the status of the Company's 
product development efforts, the results of clinical trials, the regulatory 
approval process, competition, manufacturing activities and the market 
acceptance of the Company's products. See ""Risk Factors -- Broad Discretion of 
Management to Allocate Offering Proceeds."" Pending such uses, the Company plans 
to invest the net proceeds from this Offering in short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing securities."

public offering price of $7.50 per share, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated Offering expenses (which expenses 
include a financial advisory fee of approximately $225,000 payable to The 
Gemstone Group, Inc.), are estimated to be approximately $19.8 million 
(approximately $21.9 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full). 

The Company intends to use a portion of the estimated net proceeds to pay down 
its working capital line of credit, which bears interest at the prime rate plus 
1% and is due on May 31, 1998, the balance of which was $9.2 million as of 
December 31, 1996. The Company intends to maintain this line of credit and may 
draw on the line as needed in the future. The Company intends to use 
approximately $1.5 million to pay certain portions of the purchase prices 
relating to the Berkeley and Systems Automation acquisitions. The Company 
anticipates using $1.8 million for the retirement of other short-term and long-
term indebtedness, principally equipment leases. 

The remaining net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million will be used for 
working capital and general corporate purposes, including establishment of the 
corporate level sales force described in ""Business -- Sales and Marketing."" In 
addition, the Company may use portions of the remaining net proceeds for future 
acquisitions. As discussed in ""Business -- Business Strategy,"" a significant 
element of the Company's strategy is to grow through acquisitions of companies 
in existing or complementary lines of business, although the Company is not 
currently engaged in any acquisition negotiations. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as set forth above, the Company intends 
to invest any remaining net proceeds temporarily in short-term, investment 
grade securities. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
the Common Shares offered by the Selling Shareholders."

(1) Represents the repayment of the outstanding Bridge Notes in the aggregate 
principal amount of $500,000 plus estimated accrued interest thereon at the rate
of 10% per annum to the date of consummation of this Offering. The Company used 
the net proceeds from the sale of such notes to pay for research and product 
development, operating expenses, and various expenses related to this Offering. 
Also represents the repayment of approximately $1,041,000 from the 1995 Debt 
Financing plus estimated accrued interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum, 
$133,400 payable to 732498 Ontario Ltd., plus estimated accrued interest 
thereon at the rate of 22% per annum and $300,000 payable to six investors, plus
estimated accrued interest thereon at the rate of 15%. See 'Description of 
Securities -- Prior Financings,' 'Plan of Operation' and Note 8 of Notes to 
Financial Statements. 

(2) Anticipated expenditures include hardware and software development, 
electronics engineering and prototype and tooling costs, and the hiring of 
additional personnel. The Company intends to use this allocation of net proceeds
to expand its research and development department into three groups: a research 
group, a development group and a quality assurance group. The Company 
anticipates hiring between 15 and 18 additional employees to staff these groups.
The Company estimates the first year's salaries of these persons to be paid from
this allocation of proceeds of this Offering to be approximately $19,000 to 
$38,000 per person per annum based on the qualifications and position of each 
employee. See 'Business -- Research and Development,' ' -- Production and 
Supplies' and 'Plan of Operation.' 

(3) The Company intends to use this allocation of net proceeds to open a sales 
office in the United States over the next nine months at an estimated initial 
cost of $500,000 depending on the amount of equipment, inventory and personnel, 
exclusive of working capital needs. It is anticipated that the office would be 
staffed with three to eight salespersons, who will be responsible for managing 
and servicing the Company's business in the respective areas, as well as 
developing new business. The Company estimates the first year's salaries of 
these persons to be paid from this allocation of proceeds of this Offering to be
approximately $35,000 per person per annum based on the qualifications and 
position of each employee. See 'Business -- Sales and Marketing.' 

(4) This allocation includes approximately $358,000 of expenditures for print 
media such as advertising and sales literature, and trade show participation. 
The Company plans to hire two internal sales people, each at approximately 
$20,000 per annum (excluding sales commissions), and three customer service 
people, each at approximately $25,000 per annum, following the completion of 
this Offering. See 'Business -- Sales and Marketing.' 

(5) In connection with the Company's proposed expansion and the hiring of up to 
20 additional employees, the Company intends to purchase for each new employee 
a computer work station at an estimated cost of $7,500 per station. See 'Plan 
of Operation.' 

(6) Includes general and administrative expenses, including, but not limited to,
the payment of rent for the Company's offices and other office overhead, 
executive salaries, and anticipated professional fees, as well as potential 
acquisitions as described below. 

If the Underwriter exercises the Over-allotment Option in full, the Company 
will realize additional net proceeds of approximately $365,400, which will be 
added to the Company's marketing capital. 

The Company anticipates, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the net proceeds of this Offering, together 
with its projected cash flow from operations, if any, will be sufficient to 
satisfy the Company's contemplated cash requirements for a minimum of 12 months 
following the closing date of this Offering. In the event that the Company's 
plans change or its assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or if the net 
proceeds of this Offering or the Company's projected cash flow prove to be 
insufficient to fund operations (due to unanticipated expenses, manufacturing 
problems, marketing difficulties or otherwise), the Company may find it 
necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-
described categories, or to use portions of the net proceeds for other purposes 
or may be required to seek additional financing or curtail its operations. 
The Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, 
additional financing and it is not anticipated that existing stockholders will 
provide any portion of the Company's future financing requirements. There can be
no assurance that any such additional financing will be available to the Company
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. See 'Risk Factors -- Future Capital
Needs; Uncertainty of Additional Financing' and 'Plan of Operation.' 

The Company may use all or a portion of the $344,000, or 8.0%, of the net 
proceeds from the Offering allocated to working capital, to acquire all or a 
portion of existing companies in businesses which the Company believes are 
compatible with its business including, but not limited to, competitors of the 
Company. Any decision to make an acquisition will be based upon a variety of 
factors, including, among others, the purchase price and other financial terms 
of the transaction, the business prospects and competitive position of and the 
nature of any formulations, designs or products and the extent to which any 
acquisition would enhance the Company's prospects. To the extent that the 
Company may, depending upon the opportunities available to it, finance an 
acquisition with a combination of cash and equity securities, any such issuance 
of equity securities could result in dilution to the interests of the Company's 
stockholders. However, any future equity financings within the next 36 months 
would be subject to the approval of the Underwriter. Additionally, to the extent
that the Company issues debt securities in connection with an acquisition, the 
Company may be subject to risks associated with incurring indebtedness, 
including the risks of interest rate fluctuations and insufficiency of cash flow
to pay principal and interest. The Company is not currently engaged in 
identifying any potential acquisition and has no plans, agreements, 
understandings or arrangements for any acquisitions. There can be no assurance 
that the Company will be able to successfully consummate any acquisition or 
successfully integrate into its business any acquired product or business. 

Pending utilization of the net proceeds of the Offering, the Company may make 
temporary investments, in among other things, bank certificates of deposit, 
interest-bearing investments, prime commercial paper, United States government 
obligations, or money-market funds."

compatible with its business including, but not limited to, competitors of the 
Company. Any decision to make an acquisition will be based upon a variety of 
factors, including, among others, the purchase price and other financial terms 
of the transaction, the business prospects and competitive position of and the 
nature of any formulations, designs or products and the extent to which any 
acquisition would enhance the Company's prospects. To the extent that the 
Company may, depending upon the opportunities available to it, finance an 
acquisition with a combination of cash and equity securities, any such issuance 
of equity securities could result in dilution to the interests of the Company's 
stockholders. However, any future equity financings within the next 36 months 
would be subject to the approval of the Underwriter. Additionally, to the extent
that the Company issues debt securities in connection with an acquisition, the 
Company may be subject to risks associated with incurring indebtedness, 
including the risks of interest rate fluctuations and insufficiency of cash flow
to pay principal and interest. The Company is not currently engaged in 
identifying any potential acquisition and has no plans, agreements, 
understandings or arrangements for any acquisitions. There can be no assurance 
that the Company will be able to successfully consummate any acquisition or 
successfully integrate into its business any acquired product or business. 

Pending utilization of the net proceeds of the Offering, the Company may make 
temporary investments, in among other things, bank certificates of deposit, 
interest-bearing investments, prime commercial paper, United States government 
obligations, or money-market funds."

Stock offered by the Company at the initial public offering price of $9.50 per 
share, are estimated to be approximately $21.6 million after deducting the 
estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company. 
Additionally, prior to the closing of this offering the Company will receive 
net proceeds of $960,000 from the exercise of outstanding stock purchase 
warrants. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common 
Stock by the Selling Shareholders. 

The Company anticipates that the net proceeds of the offering will be used 
(i) to repay all of the Company's outstanding debt to Sirrom Capital Corporation
(approximately $4.5 million at December 31, 1996) (the ""Sirrom Debt""), 
(ii) to repay debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of PrysmTech 
($3.2 million at December 31, 1996) (the ""PrysmTech Debt""), (iii) to repay an 
outstanding note to Emro Marketing Company, a customer of the Company 
(approximately $918,000 at December 31, 1996) (the ""Emro Note""), (iv) to repay 
an outstanding note to Lawrence D. Parker, a shareholder of the Company 
(the ""Shareholder Note"") (approximately $170,000 at December 31, 1996), (v) to 
repurchase 793,093 shares of Common Stock for a total of approximately $2.1 
million from two shareholders from whom the Company has a right of repurchase 
at a substantial discount to the initial public offering price and (vi) for 
general corporate purposes, including research and development, sales and 
marketing, possible strategic acquisitions and the increased working capital 
requirements of the Company generated by its growth. 

The Sirrom Debt was incurred to finance working capital requirements resulting 
from the Company's growth. The Sirrom Debt bears interest at a fixed rate of 
14.0% and is payable in monthly installments of accrued interest to maturity 
(due June 2001 with respect to $3.0 million of the original principal amount and
due September 2001 with respect to $1.5 million of the original principal 
amount). The PrysmTech Debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of 
PrysmTech in December 1996, bears interest at a rate of 8.5% and is due December
1998. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" The Shareholder Note 
was incurred in October 1994 to repurchase a portion of Mr. Parker's equity 
interest in the Company, bears interest at a rate of 8.0% and is payable in 
equal monthly installments through December 1997. The Emro Note bears interest 
at a rate of 6.0% and is due February 2002. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The Company has no current specific plan for the remaining estimated net 
offering proceeds of approximately $10.7 million. The Company is raising such 
monies at this time in order to increase the Company's working and equity 
capital, to create a market for the Company's Common Stock, to facilitate 
future access by the Company to public equity markets, to enhance the Company's 
public image and credibility to support its marketing efforts, particularly 
with current and potential future strategic partners, and for general corporate 
purposes. Such general corporate purposes include the funding of the support of 
the Company's sales and marketing efforts, funding the development and 
enhancement of the Company's services and technology and expanding customer 
support operations. The Company also may use a portion of the net proceeds to 
acquire other businesses, technologies, services or products complementary to 
the Company's current business, although the Company currently has no agreements
or understandings with respect to any acquisition, and no portion of the net 
proceeds has been allocated to specific acquisitions. 

Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-
term, interest-bearing investment grade securities."

underwriting discounts and estimated expenses payable by the Company) are 
estimated to be approximately $33.0 million ($38.6 million if the Underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full). The Company expects to use the 
net proceeds to reduce the Company's indebtedness under the Bank Credit 
Agreement.

 The indebtedness to be repaid under the Bank Credit Agreement consists of 
multi-tranche term loans with a current aggregate principal balance of $95.0 
million (the ""Term Loans""), with principal payments scheduled in varying amounts 
from 1996 through 2004. Such Term Loans bear interest at varying rates based, at
the Company's option, on either the Eurodollar rate (as defined in the Bank 
Credit Agreement) plus 275 to 325 basis points or the bank base rate (as defined
in the Bank Credit Agreement) plus 175 to 225 basis points. The overall 
effective interest rate for the Term Loans at October 2, 1996 was 8.48%. 
See ""Description of Certain Indebtedness--Bank Credit Agreement."" 

In connection with the Offering, the Company expects to refinance the 
indebtedness under the Bank Credit Agreement remaining after application of the 
net proceeds of the Offering as described above. See ""Management's Discussion

offered hereby are estimated to be $6.4 million ($7.5 million if the 
Underwriters' overallotment option is exercised in full). The Company intends 
to use approximately $4.65 million of the net proceeds to repay all outstanding 
indebtedness under the Company's bank loan agreement. Of the outstanding amount,
 $1.8 million was borrowed in 1995 and 1996 to fund dental practice acquisitions
 and equipment purchases; this amount matures on August 30, 2000 and carries 
an interest rate of 1.50% over prime (or 9.75% at September 30, 1996). Another 
$0.75 million of the outstanding amount matures on August 30, 1999 and carries 
an interest rate of 1.25% over prime (or 9.50% at September 30, 1996). The 
remaining outstanding amount is borrowed pursuant to two lines of credit. One 
of the two lines of credit provides a maximum of $1.85 million, carries an 
interest rate of 1.00% over prime (or 9.25% at September 30, 1996), and matures 
on October 31, 1997. The other line provides a maximum of $0.65 million, 
carries an interest rate of 2.50% over prime (or 10.75% at September 30, 1996), 
and matures on February 28, 1997, or 10 days after the consummation of this 
public offering, if earlier. Upon repayment of the outstanding indebtedness as 
described above, all personal guarantees provided by certain officers, 
directors, and shareholders of the Company with respect to the Company's 
current credit arrangements will be canceled. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

If the proposed acquisition of Blue Oak is completed, $775,000 of the net 
proceeds is expected to be used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price.
 See ""Proposed Acquisition."" The balance of the net proceeds, together with the 
borrowing capacity resulting from the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, is 
expected to be used to fund acquisitions of dental practices, improvements in 
existing and acquired practices, working capital and other general corporate 
purposes. Although an integral part of the Company's strategy is to grow 
through acquisitions, and the Company is currently in discussions with several 
dental practices in both its current and potential future geographic markets, 
no acquisition other than the proposed acquisition of Blue Oak is the subject 
of any letter of intent or definitive agreement."

     The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock

Stock offered by the Company at the initial public offering price of $9.50 per 
share, are estimated to be approximately $21.6 million after deducting the 
estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company. 
Additionally, prior to the closing of this offering the Company will receive 
net proceeds of $960,000 from the exercise of outstanding stock purchase 
warrants. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common 
Stock by the Selling Shareholders. 

The Company anticipates that the net proceeds of the offering will be used 
(i) to repay all of the Company's outstanding debt to Sirrom Capital 
Corporation (approximately $4.5 million at December 31, 1996) (the ""Sirrom 
Debt""), (ii) to repay debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of 
PrysmTech ($3.2 million at December 31, 1996) (the ""PrysmTech Debt""), (iii) to 
repay an outstanding note to Emro Marketing Company, a customer of the Company 
(approximately $918,000 at December 31, 1996) (the ""Emro Note""), (iv) to repay 
an outstanding note to Lawrence D. Parker, a shareholder of the Company (the 
""Shareholder Note"") (approximately $170,000 at December 31, 1996), (v) to 
repurchase 793,093 shares of Common Stock for a total of approximately $2.1
 million from two shareholders from whom the Company has a right of repurchase 
at a substantial discount to the initial public offering price and (vi) for 
general corporate purposes, including research and development, sales and 
marketing, possible strategic acquisitions and the increased working capital 
requirements of the Company generated by its growth. 

The Sirrom Debt was incurred to finance working capital requirements resulting 
from the Company's growth. The Sirrom Debt bears interest at a fixed rate of 
14.0% and is payable in monthly installments of accrued interest to maturity 
(due June 2001 with respect to $3.0 million of the original principal amount 
and due September 2001 with respect to $1.5 million of the original principal 
amount). The PrysmTech Debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of 
PrysmTech in December 1996, bears interest at a rate of 8.5% and is due 
December 1998. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" The Shareholder 
Note was incurred in October 1994 to repurchase a portion of Mr. Parker's 
equity interest in the Company, bears interest at a rate of 8.0% and is payable 
in equal monthly installments through December 1997. The Emro Note bears 
interest at a rate of 6.0% and is due February 2002. See ""Certain 
Transactions."" 

The Company has no current specific plan for the remaining estimated net 
offering proceeds of approximately $10.7 million. The Company is raising such 
monies at this time in order to increase the Company's working and equity 
capital, to create a market for the Company's Common Stock, to facilitate 
future access by the Company to public equity markets, to enhance the Company's 
public image and credibility to support its marketing efforts, particularly 
with current and potential future strategic partners, and for general corporate 
purposes. Such general corporate purposes include the funding of the support of 
the Company's sales and marketing efforts, funding the development and 
enhancement of the Company's services and technology and expanding customer 
support operations. The Company also may use a portion of the net proceeds to 
acquire other businesses, technologies, services or products complementary to 
the Company's current business, although the Company currently has no 
agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisition, and no portion of 
the net proceeds has been allocated to specific acquisitions. 

Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-
term, interest-bearing investment grade securities."

(1) Sales and marketing includes expenses for increased advertising activity 
including trade shows, product demonstrations and other advertising and 
promotional efforts. Sales and marketing may also include expenses associated 
with the development of strategic marketing affiliations within the Company's 
industry. 

(2) Included in research and development is the expenditure of approximately 
$860,000 to convert the-EDEN-OA(R) tool to a graphical based program, including 
conversion of the current SAFETRACE(TM) software product and all enhancements 
in process of being made to the SAFETRACE(TM) software product. Also included 
are expenditures of approximately $420,000 for the development of the 
SAFETRACETx(TM) software product, and $515,000 for continuing efforts to obtain 
the FDA 510(k) clearance letter, documentation for the SAFETRACETx(TM) software 
product development and expansion of the Customer Help Line. Additionally, 
$500,000 will be used for ongoing research and development of information 
systems technology utilized in the Company's DataMed division to enhance the 
automation of its customer service. The remaining $205,000 will be used for 
development of products ancillary to the SAFET RACE(TM) software product line. 
Approximately $2,000,000 of these expenditures are anticipated to be made in 
1997 and $500,000 in 1998. 

(3) The Company has a revolving line of credit with a bank which bears interest 
at 2% plus prime compounded monthly per annum. As of September 30, 1996, the 
Company's outstanding balance on the line of credit was $970,000. The borrowed 
funds were used for working capital. In January, 1997, the Company borrowed 
$450,000 from two individuals at 12% interest. The notes are due the earlier of 
the closing of this Offering or March 23, 1997. The borrowed funds were used 
for working capital. In connection with the loans, the Company issued warrants 
to purchase 150,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable at 85% of the price per 
share of the Common Stock included in the Units. 

(4) Includes $235,000 principal and estimated accrued interest of approximately 
$18,000 on the 10% Notes, $85,000 principal amount of which are owned by 
certain directors and officers of the Company and a principal shareholder of 
the Company. See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. Holders of an 
additional $516,200 principal amount of 10% Notes have indicated their 
intention to convert their 10% Notes for 137,646 shares of Common Stock plus an 
estimated additional 10,324 shares for approximately $38,715 of accrued 
interest. The proceeds from the sale of the 10% Notes were used for working 
capital. 

(5) The Company may use a portion of the funds allocated for working capital to 
acquire companies and/or technology in fields related to the Company's 
business. The Company has no present plans, proposals, arrangements or 
understandings with respect to acquisitions of other companies or technology. 

The allocation of the net proceeds from this Offering set forth above 
represents the Company's best estimate based on its present plans and certain 
assumptions regarding general economic and industry conditions and the 
Company's anticipated future revenues and expenditures. If any of these factors 
change, the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of 
the proceeds from working capital to other of the above-described categories. 
The Company anticipates, based on its current proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the proceeds of this Offering, together with 
projected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its 
contemplated cash requirements for the next 12 to 18 months, although the 
Company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating losses and 
significant capital expenses during that period. The Company's cash 
requirements beyond this period will depend on many factors, including (but not 
limited to) the Company's cash flow from operations, the length of time it may 
take for the Company to develop or acquire products or services for the market,
 the market acceptance of these products or services, and the response of 
competitors who may develop competing products or services at lower cost. To 
the extent that the funds generated by this Offering are insufficient to fund 
the Company's activities in the short or long term, the Company may need to 
raise additional debt or equity through public or private financings. The 
Company has no commitment for any such financing, and there can be no assurance 
that any additional financing will be available to the Company, when needed, 
and on reasonable terms. See Risk Factors. 
If the over-allotment option is exercised (of which there can be no assurance), 
the Company will receive additional net proceeds of approximately $1,221,350. 
Any proceeds received from the exercise of the over-allotment option will be 
added to working capital. 

The amounts set forth above merely indicate the proposed use of proceeds, and 
the actual expenditures may vary substantially from the estimates. None of the 
items set forth in the foregoing table should be considered as a firm 
commitment by the Company. 

To the extent that the net proceeds are not used immediately, the Company will 
invest such net proceeds in short-term government securities through a bank or 
in a non-discretionary account of the Company with the Representative."

(1) Sales and marketing includes expenses for increased advertising activity 
including trade shows, product demonstrations and other advertising and 
promotional efforts. Sales and marketing may also include expenses associated 
with the development of strategic marketing affiliations within the Company's 
industry. 

(2) Included in research and development is the expenditure of approximately 
$860,000 to convert the-EDEN-OA(R) tool to a graphical based program, including 
conversion of the current SAFETRACE(TM) software product and all enhancements 
in process of being made to the SAFETRACE(TM) software product. Also included 
are expenditures of approximately $420,000 for the development of the 
SAFETRACETx(TM) software product, and $515,000 for continuing efforts to obtain 
the FDA 510(k) clearance letter, documentation for the SAFETRACETx(TM) software 
product development and expansion of the Customer Help Line. Additionally, 
$500,000 will be used for ongoing research and development of information 
systems technology utilized in the Company's DataMed division to enhance the 
automation of its customer service. The remaining $205,000 will be used for 
development of products ancillary to the SAFET RACE(TM) software product line. 
Approximately $2,000,000 of these expenditures are anticipated to be made in 
1997 and $500,000 in 1998. 

(3) The Company has a revolving line of credit with a bank which bears interest 
at 2% plus prime compounded monthly per annum. As of September 30, 1996, the 
Company's outstanding balance on the line of credit was $970,000. The borrowed 
funds were used for working capital. In January, 1997, the Company borrowed 
$450,000 from two individuals at 12% interest. The notes are due the earlier of 
the closing of this Offering or March 23, 1997. The borrowed funds were used 
for working capital. In connection with the loans, the Company issued warrants 
to purchase 150,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable at 85% of the price per 
share of the Common Stock included in the Units. 

(4) Includes $235,000 principal and estimated accrued interest of approximately 
$18,000 on the 10% Notes, $85,000 principal amount of which are owned by 
certain directors and officers of the Company and a principal shareholder of 
the Company. See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. Holders of an 
additional $516,200 principal amount of 10% Notes have indicated their 
intention to convert their 10% Notes for 137,646 shares of Common Stock plus an 
estimated additional 10,324 shares for approximately $38,715 of accrued 
interest. The proceeds from the sale of the 10% Notes were used for working 
capital. 

(5) The Company may use a portion of the funds allocated for working capital to 
acquire companies and/or technology in fields related to the Company's 
business. The Company has no present plans, proposals, arrangements or 
understandings with respect to acquisitions of other companies or technology. 

The allocation of the net proceeds from this Offering set forth above 
represents the Company's best estimate based on its present plans and certain 
assumptions regarding general economic and industry conditions and the 
Company's anticipated future revenues and expenditures. If any of these factors 
change, the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of 
the proceeds from working capital to other of the above-described categories. 
The Company anticipates, based on its current proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the proceeds of this Offering, together with 
projected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its 
contemplated cash requirements for the next 12 to 18 months, although the 
Company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating losses and 
significant capital expenses during that period. The Company's cash 
requirements beyond this period will depend on many factors, including (but not 
limited to) the Company's cash flow from operations, the length of time it may 
take for the Company to develop or acquire products or services for the market,
 the market acceptance of these products or services, and the response of 
competitors who may develop competing products or services at lower cost. To 
the extent that the funds generated by this Offering are insufficient to fund 
the Company's activities in the short or long term, the Company may need to 
raise additional debt or equity through public or private financings. The 
Company has no commitment for any such financing, and there can be no assurance 
that any additional financing will be available to the Company, when needed, 
and on reasonable terms. See Risk Factors. 
If the over-allotment option is exercised (of which there can be no assurance), 
the Company will receive additional net proceeds of approximately $1,221,350. 
Any proceeds received from the exercise of the over-allotment option will be 
added to working capital. 

The amounts set forth above merely indicate the proposed use of proceeds, and 
the actual expenditures may vary substantially from the estimates. None of the 
items set forth in the foregoing table should be considered as a firm 
commitment by the Company. 

To the extent that the net proceeds are not used immediately, the Company will 
invest such net proceeds in short-term government securities through a bank or 
in a non-discretionary account of the Company with the Representative."

 The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the 
Selling Stockholders. 

The offering is being undertaken at the present time to create a public market 
for the Common Stock, to facilitate future access to public markets, and to 
obtain additional working capital and to provide increased visibility and 
credibility in a marketplace where many of the Company's competitors are 
publicly held companies. The Company plans to use the net proceeds to the 
Company from this offering primarily for working capital and general corporate 
purposes, as well as for possible acquisitions of businesses, products and 
technologies that are complementary to those of the Company. Although there are 
no current agreements or negotiations with respect to any such transactions, 
the Company from time-to-time evaluates such opportunities. Pending such uses, 
the Company plans to invest the net proceeds in investment grade, interest-
bearing securities."

Acquisition, which bear interest at 8% per annum and mature November 1, 2001, 
(iv) notes payable of $345,000 as part of the consideration for the addition of 
six acquired Dental Centers occurring after June 30, 1996, which bear interest 
at rates ranging between 8% and 9% per annum and mature at October 2001, and 
(v) $220,000 of equipment lease obligations, which bear interest at rates 
currently ranging between 15% and 21% per annum; and (c) the balance of 
approximately $1.4 million for miscellaneous working capital and general

The Company anticipates using approximately $2.0 million to expand its 
manufacturing capacity, particularly for the production of TRBs and ball 
bearings supplied to the automotive industry, including possible investments in 
joint ventures abroad or by providing equipment to vendors for use at their 
facilities under the guidelines of certain supply agreements. As of the date 
hereof, the Company has not committed to enter into any joint venture or other 
arrangement with vendors that would be funded with the proceeds of this 
Offering. Of the remaining net proceeds, the Company anticipates using 
approximately $1.0 million for expanded marketing and research and development
 and approximately $2.1 million for working capital, including general 
corporate purposes and possibly the acquisition of the business or assets of 
other bearing manufacturers. However, the Company at the present time has not 
identified any acquisition candidates. Pending the application of the net 
proceeds for such purposes, the Company intends to use such proceeds to repay
 outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of January 24,
 1997, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit 
Facility of approximately $9,623,000. The Revolving Credit Facility currently 
terminates in June 1998 and will remain available through that date, with or 
without repayment of outstanding borrowings with the proceeds of this Offering.
 The Revolving Credit Facility allows for borrowings, from time to time, not to 
exceed the lesser of $15.0 million or an amount equal to the sum of (i) 85% of 
eligible receivables, as defined, (ii) 50% of eligible inventory, as defined, 
consisting of raw materials, (iii) 50% of eligible inventory, as defined, 
consisting of finished goods, and (iv) 50% of eligible inventory, as defined, 
in transit under letters of credit less the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of 
outstanding letters of credit and (y) such reserves as the lender may 
reasonably deem proper and necessary from time to time. Based upon such formula 
and Overadvances, as of December 11, 1996, the maximum amount the Company could 
borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately $10,076,000. 
Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the 
bank's base rate (8.25% per annum at January 24, 1997) plus 2%. Based upon the 
Company's performance and 20 year relationship with BNYCC, the Company intends 
to seek and believes it may be able to obtain more favorable terms on the 
Revolving Credit Facility upon the completion of this Offering, although there 
can be no assurance it will be able to do so. See ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition."" The foregoing 
represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of the net proceeds of 
this Offering based upon current economic and industry conditions and the 
current state of its business operations and plans. The application of proceeds 
for any particular purpose will depend on a number of factors, including the 
timing of expenditures, other business and acquisition opportunities, and the 
availability of funds from operations or other sources. As a result, the 
Company may find it desirable, and reserves the right, to change the allocation 
of funds among the applications identified above. None of the net proceeds of 
this Offering will be paid, in the aggregate, to NASD members, affiliates, 
associated persons or related persons."

plus accrued interest outstanding under a note payable to Technical Services 
Partners, L.P. (""TSP""), the Company's sole stockholder, which is due in August 
1998 and bears interest at 10% per annum (see ""Certain Transactions""). In addition,
 the Company plans to use approximately $11.5 million to repay a portion of (i)
 $16.0 million outstanding under a senior term loan which is payable in 84 monthly 
principal payments commencing November 1997 and bears interest at a rate of 
LIBOR plus 2.75% or the prime rate quoted by Chase Manhattan Bank (""Prime"") plus
 .75%, at the Company's option, which was incurred to repay amounts outstanding
 under the Company's previous credit facility, and/or (ii) $24.6 million outstanding 
under notes payable and capital leases which are due at various times through 
2001 and bear interest at fixed rates ranging between 9.0% and 12.0% per year,

to the Company. The Company intends to apply the remaining net proceeds of the 
offering to fund planned capital expenditures, for working capital, to fund 
potential acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. The Company expects

that it would fund the potential acquisition currently under consideration from
 the assumption of indebtedness of the acquired entity and, if necessary, from

capital and equity base, create a public market for the Company's Common Stock, 
facilitate future access to public capital markets and provide increased 
visibility and credibility for the Company in its marketplace. The net proceeds 
to the Company from the sale of the 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock offered by 
the Company hereby are estimated to be $105.9 million ($121.9 million if the 
over-allotment options are exercised in full), after deducting the underwriting 
discount and estimated offering expenses. The Company also expects to receive 
additional proceeds of approximately $0.6 million from the exercise of certain 
outstanding warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock 
which are convertible into 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock. 

The Company has no current plans for the net proceeds of the Offerings. The 
Company intends to add the net proceeds from the Offerings and from the 
exercise of warrants to working capital, where such proceeds will be available 
to support general corporate purposes which are expected to include capital 
equipment expenditures to support selling and marketing, manufacturing and 
product development activities. A portion of the proceeds may also be used to 
acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the 
right to use complementary technologies. From time to time, in the ordinary 
course of business, the Company evaluates potential acquisitions of such 
businesses, products or technologies. However, the Company has no present

commissions and estimated expenses, are estimated to be approximately 
$21,210,000 ($24,558,000 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full). The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. The Company expects to use a portion 
of the net proceeds to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the Company's 
loan agreement with NationsBank of Tennessee, N.A. (the 'Credit Facility'). 
Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company may borrow up to 
$5.0 million for working capital and other corporate purposes (the 'Working 
Capital Facility') and up to $15.0 million to finance the acquisition of assets 
(the 'Aquisition Facility'), subject to a lower amount based on an 'established 
borrowing base,' as defined in the Credit Facility. As of January 17, 1997, 
approximately $5.6 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility, of which 
$3.9 million was borrowed under the Working Capital Facility and $1.7 million 
was borrowed under the Acquisition Facility. Of the amounts borrowed under the 
Credit Facility, approximately $1.7 million was utilized to finance the cash 
portion of the consideration paid by the Company to finance the acquisition of 
the assets of the predecessor of ROA, approximately $800,000 was used to fund 
loans by the Company to certain physician owners of the Initial Affiliated 
Practices to cover anticipated cash flow needs, and other borrowings have been 
used for working capital and other corporate purposes, principally to purchase 
receivables from the Initial Affilated Practices. 

The Working Capital Facility matures on October 31, 1997 and the Acquisition 
Facility matures on October 31, 1998. The Company can elect to borrow on either 
facility at a floating rate based on the prime rate plus an applicable margin 
or at a fixed rate based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. At January 17, 
1997, the effective interest rate for both the Acquisition and the Working 
Capital Facilities was 7.23% per annum. See 'Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and 
Capital Resources.' 

The balance of the net proceeds will be used to finance the acquisition of 
assets of additional Affiliated Practices, for working capital, including the 
acquisition of receivables from the Initial Affiliated Practices, and other 
general corporate purposes. Although the Company has engaged in discussions 
with practices with which it might affiliate, except as described under 
'Business -- Initial Affiliated Practices,' the Company has no definitive 
agreements regarding any affiliations with additional practices. Pending such 
uses, the net proceeds will be invested in United States government securities

The Company intends to capitalize the Reinsurance Subsidiary initially at $3,500,000. Such 
capitalization is based on the current capital requirements for Class 3 insurers 
in Bermuda. 
The balance of the net proceeds will be used for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes, for the expansion of the Company's marketing and 
distribution systems and for the upgrading and expansion of its data processing
 capabilities and facilities and other corporate systems. Although as of the 
date of this Prospectus no specific acquisition is being contemplated by the 
Company, such general corporate purposes could include future acquisitions. 
If the Underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full, the Company will
 realize additional net proceeds of approximately $1,450,000, which will be added
 to the Company's working capital. 
The foregoing uses of proceeds represent the Company's best estimates of the 
allocation of the estimated net proceeds of this Offering and there could be 
significant variations in the anticipated or actual use of the proceeds due to 
changes in business or economic circumstances. Accordingly, the Company reserves 
the right to reallocate the foregoing uses of proceeds depending upon any such 
change of circumstances. 
Pending utilization of the net proceeds of the Offering, the Company may make 
temporary investments in, among other things, bank certificates of deposit, 
interest-bearing investments, prime commercial paper, United States government
 obligations, or money-market funds."

approximately $40.1 million ($47.8 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment 
option is exercised in full). The Company intends to use the net proceeds of 
the Offering for the retirement of its entire remaining indebtedness, 
consisting of $750,000 of 18% subordinated promissory notes due May 31, 1997, 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including an estimated 
$5.5 million for equipment and personnel to support accelerated product 
development and an estimated $3.0 million to enhance the Company's domestic and 
international distribution capabilities. The Company may also use a portion of 
the net proceeds of the Offering to fund acquisitions of complementary 
businesses, products or technologies, although there are no current agreements 
or negotiations with respect to any such acquisitions. Pending use of the net 
proceeds, the Company will invest the net proceeds in short-term investment 
grade securities. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. 

The principal reasons for making the Offering at the present time are to obtain 
additional working capital and for general corporate purposes, to create a 
market for the Common Stock of the Company and to facilitate future access to 
the public market. The amounts and timing of expenditures may vary 
significantly depending upon numerous factors, including the rate of progress 
in the Company's current product development efforts, the magnitude of 
additional product development efforts of the Company, technological advances, 
the status of competitive products and the availability of alternative methods 
of financing. Accordingly, management will have broad discretion in the use of 
the proceeds of the Offering to the Company. The Company anticipates that its 
existing capital resources, including the proceeds of the Offering, will be 
adequate to satisfy its capital needs through 1997. See ""Management's

 Stock offered by it hereunder are estimated to be approximately $14.27 million
 after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated additional Offering expenses 
of approximately $750,000 payable by the Company, which includes the Representatives'
 expense allowance. The Company intends to use approximately $9.35 million of
 the net proceeds of the Offering to (i) pay approximately $3.65 million of the
 outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note issued to Burlington in 
connection with the acquisition of ATI, (ii) expand its manufacturing capacity 
through the purchase of additional capital equipment estimated to aggregate 
approximately $3.0 million over the next two years, (iii) repay in full its 
existing term and revolving bank debt aggregating approximately $2.6 million at
 December 31, 1996, and (iv) make approximately $100,000 of capital improvements 
to ATI's plant in Texas. The Company expects that the approximately $4.92 million 
remaining from the estimated net proceeds, with respect to which the Company has 
no specific plans, will be used for general corporate purposes, including research 
and development and possible additional acquisitions of complementary businesses
 and product lines. 
The terms of the Convertible Note issued to Burlington in connection with the 
acquisition of ATI require that the Company pay $3,648,250, an amount equal to
 half of the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note ($7,296,500)
 to the holder thereof, no later than seven months following the Offering. On 
October 30, 2002, 50% of the then-oustanding principal amount of the Convertible 
Note, plus any additional amount permitted by the Company's then-existing financial 
covenants with any senior lenders, will be payable. Any remaining principal 
amount of the Convertible Note will be payable on October 30, 2003. The Convertible 
Note bears interest at the rate of 9.5% per annum. 
The Company's $1.425 million term equipment loan bears interest, at the Company's 
option, at the prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") plus 
2.25%. The Company's revolving line of credit, with $1,179,967 outstanding as of
 December 31, 1996, bears interest, at the Company's option, at the prime rate
 or LIBOR plus 1.75%. As of September 30, 1996 the Company had elected (i) a 
nine month LIBOR rate on the equipment loan which will be effective through 
March 1, 1997 and which equals an ""all-in"" rate of 8%, and 
(ii) to pay interest at the prime rate (8 1/4 %) on borrowings under the line
 of credit. The Company borrowed amounts under the line of credit for working 
capital purposes, primarily to finance increases in inventory balances in 1996.
 The Company may consider purchasing its manufacturing facility in Brunswick, 
Maine. The Company has had discussions with several parties regarding additional 
acquisitions, but has no agreements or commitments with respect to any such 
additional acquisitions. Pending the uses described above, the proceeds of the 
Offering will be invested in short-and medium-term investment-grade, interest-
bearing securities. 
In addition to its desire to make the expenditures described above, the Company
 chose to proceed with the Offering at this time because it believes current
 market conditions are favorable for equity offerings of issuers similar to 
Company, because it would like to create liquidity for its current stockholders
 and employees, many of whom have owned Common Stock, or options to purchase 
Common Stock, for a number of years, and because it believes a public market for
 the Common Stock will enable it to better take advantage of acquisition and 
other opportunities (such as the acquisition of ATI) where it can use shares of
 Common Stock as consideration. Management also believes that the net proceeds 
from the Offering will enable the Company to increase its domestic market share
 and fuel expansion in foreign markets."

In the event that the Company's plans change or its assumptions change or 
prove to be inaccurate or if the proceeds of this offering prove insufficient 
to fund operations (due to unanticipated expenses or difficulties or otherwise), 
the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the 
proceeds within the above-described categories or to use portions thereof for 
other purposes or may be required to seek additional financing or curtail its 
operations. Future events, including changes in economic or industry conditions 
or the Company's planned operations, may require the Company to use proceeds 
allocated to working capital for marketing and sales or reallocate proceeds 
among the various intended uses if it is determined at a later date that an 
increase in such expenditures or reallocation of proceeds is necessary or 
desirable. Any such determination would be based on, among other things, 
whether and to what extent revenue from systems sales is sufficient to offset 
operating expenses and the capital requirements associated with maintaining an 
inventory of system components. Alternatively, the Company may use less of the 
proceeds for marketing and sales in the event that such initial efforts prove 
more successful than anticipated or the Company generates sufficient cash flow 
from operations to otherwise fund such efforts. 

The Company may, if and when the opportunity arises, use a portion of the 
proceeds of this offering allocated to working capital, together with the 
issuance of debt or equity securities, to acquire rights to technology and/or 
products or to acquire existing companies in businesses the Company believes 
are compatible with its business. Any decision to make such an acquisition will 
be based upon a variety of factors, including, among others, the purchase price 
and other financial terms of the transaction, the business prospects and 
competitive position of, and technology or products provided by, the 
acquisition candidate and the extent to which any technology or business would 
enhance the Company's prospects. Potential acquisition candidates may include 
companies with products or technologies that are compatible with the Company's 
products, or that the Company believes would provide the Company with 
additional distribution channels. As of the date of this Prospectus, the 
Company has no agreements, understandings or arrangements with respect to any 
such acquisition. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to 
successfully consummate any acquisition or successfully integrate any acquired 
business into its operations. Investors in this offering will not have an 
opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any acquisition. 
The Company believes that the net proceeds of this offering together with 
available cash will be sufficient to meet the Company's operating expenses and 
capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. The Company 
anticipates that additional funding will be required after the use of the net 
proceeds of the offering. No assurance can be given that such additional 
financing will be available when needed on terms acceptable to the Company, if 
at all. See ""Risk Factors -- Significant Capital Requirements; Dependence on 
Offering Proceeds; Possible Need for Additional Financing."" 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be

The proposed use of the net offering proceeds described herein represents the 
Company's anticipated use of the proceeds based upon current operating plans 
and certain assumptions, including those relating to the Company's future 
revenue levels and expenditures and assumptions regarding industry and general 
economic and other conditions. Future unforeseen events may make it necessary 
or advisable for the Company to reallocate the net proceeds among the above 
uses. Any such reallocations will be at the discretion of the Company. See 
""Risk Factors -- Discretion to Reallocate Use of Proceeds."" 
The Company plans to use approximately $1,600,000 of the proceeds to retire 
certain corporate debt and capital leases. This includes (i) a $250,000 bank 
term note with an interest rate of 1% over prime (9.25% at September 30, 1996) 
that matures October 18, 1997; (ii) a bank term note that will be in the 
approximate amount of $492,300 at the time of this Offering with an interest 
rate of 2% over the bank's base lending rate (10.25% at September 30, 1996) on 
a five year amortization schedule that matures June 8, 1999; (iii) a bank 
equipment note that will be in the approximate amount of $250,000 at the time 
of this Offering with an interest rate of 2% over the bank's base lending rate 
(10.25% at September 30, 1996) on a three year amortization schedule that 
matures June 8, 1998; and (iv) various equipment leases that will be in the 
approximate amount of $607,641 at the time of this Offering on three year 
amortization schedules with varying interest rates (ranging between 9.23% and 
11.45% at September 30, 1996). Tom W. Olofson personally guarantees 
substantially all of the Company's outstanding debt. Upon application of the 
proceeds of the Offering, Mr. Olofson's guarantee obligations with respect to 
such debt will be extinguished. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The Company intends to retire a $400,000 subordinated note with an interest 
rate of 10% that matures July 15, 1998 owned by Tom W. Olofson, Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The Company plans to use approximately $1,250,000 to expand its sales and 
marketing efforts. This may include hiring additional sales/marketing staff, 
publishing new advertising and promotional materials, attending additional 
trade shows and conventions, and increasing national marketing coverage through 
more extensive field sales calls. The Company plans to use approximately 
$900,000 of the proceeds for software development. This may include the 
development of new applications, enhancement to existing applications, hiring 
of new development staff, acquisition of new development technologies and/or 
training for the Company's software development staff. 

The Company anticipates, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the net proceeds of the Offering, together 
with projected cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy the 
Company's contemplated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
Pending application, the net proceeds of the Offering will be invested in short-
term, high-grade interest-bearing savings accounts, certificates of deposit, 
United States government obligations, money market accounts or short-term 
interest bearing obligations. Any proceeds received upon exercise of the 
Underwriter's Warrant, as well as income from investments, will be used for 
general corporate purposes."

shares of Common Stock offered by it hereby are estimated to be approximately 
$22.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
offering expenses. 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows: 
(i) approximately $19.3 million to repay outstanding indebtedness, consisting of 
(a) approximately $14.1 million outstanding under a revolving line of credit 
with First Union Commercial Credit Corporation (""First Union""), which matures 
on December 22, 1998 and bears interest, at the Company's option, at either the 
prime rate or LIBOR plus 250 basis points (280 basis points for the European 
operations) (with a weighted average interest rate during 1996 of 8.2%), (b) 
$3.5 million of subordinated notes payable to Sirrom Capital Corporation 
(""Sirrom"") with a carrying value of $3.1 million (reflecting approximately 
$400,000 of debt discount), which mature on July 9, 2001 and bear interest at 
an annual rate of 13.5%, (c) approximately $1.2 million outstanding under notes 
payable to the sellers of Intersec, which mature between July 8, 1997 and April 
8, 1998 and bear interest at an annual rate of 9.0% and (d) approximately 
$500,000 outstanding under a term loan with First Union, which matures on 
December 22, 1998 and bears interest, at the Company's option, at either the 
prime rate plus 75 basis points or LIBOR plus 300 basis points (with a weighted 
average interest rate during 1996 of approximately 8.6%); (ii) approximately 
$1.0 million for enhancements to the Company's management information systems; 
(iii) $750,000 to redeem a warrant held by Sirrom; and (iv) the balance for 
general corporate purposes, including working capital purposes to support the 
Company's growth and possible acquisitions. The notes to Sirrom were issued to 
finance the Intersec acquisition in July 1996. Pending such uses, the Company 
intends to invest the net proceeds of this offering in investment-grade, short-
term, interest-bearing securities. In the second quarter of 1997, the Company 
expects to incur a non-recurring after-tax charge of approximately $400,000 as 
a result of early extinguishment of debt. 

Although the Company regularly evaluates possible acquisition opportunities, it 
is not currently engaged in any negotiations and is not a party to any letter 
of intent or other agreement or arrangement regarding any material acquisition.

The net proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares may vary depending upon 
financial and market conditions at the time of the completion of the Offering. 
See ""THE CONVERSION - Pricing and Number of Common Shares to be Sold."" The 
expenses detailed above are estimated. Estimated expenses include estimated 
sales commissions payable to Webb. Sales commissions have been computed on the 
basis of the following assumptions: (i) approximately 10% of the Common Shares 
sold in the Offering will be purchased by directors, officers and employees of 
the Association and the members of their immediate families; (ii) 8% of the 
Common Shares sold in the Offering will be purchased by the ESOP; and (iii) the 
remaining 82% of the Common Shares sold in the Offering will be sold in the 
Subscription Offering with sales commissions of 1.5% of the aggregate dollar 
amount of such Common Shares. Actual expenses may be more or less than 
estimated. See ""THE CONVERSION - Marketing Plan."" 

MFC will retain 50% of the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares, or 
approximately $4.8 million at the mid-point of the Valuation Range, including 
the value of a promissory note from the ESOP which MFC intends to accept in 
exchange for the issuance of MFC Common Shares to the ESOP. The cash proceeds 
received from the sale of Common Shares will be used by MFC to fund the RRP, 
which intends to purchase up to 4% of all Common Shares sold in the Conversion, 
and for general corporate purposes, which may include the payment of dividends, 
repurchases of Common Shares and acquisitions of other financial institutions. 
MFC presently has no specific plans to use the proceeds for any such purposes, 
except the funding of the RRP. See ""THE CONVERSION - Restrictions on Repurchase 
of Common Shares."" 

The remainder of the net proceeds received from the sale of the Common Shares, 
approximately $4.8 million at the mid-point of the Valuation Range, will be 
invested by MFC in the capital stock to be issued by the Association to MFC as 
a result of the Conversion and will increase the regulatory capital of the 
Association. Initially, for liquidity purposes and to fund purchases of common 
shares for the RRP, the Association will invest approximately $800,000 in U.S. 
Treasury and government agency securities with maturities of three years or 
less and short-term interest-bearing deposits. The Association expects to 
increase its loan origination staff and utilize the balance of the net proceeds 
to originate adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. No assurance can be 
provided, however, with respect to when such hiring or originations will occur 
or the effect such efforts will have on the Association's financial condition 
or earnings."

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of the 
net proceeds of this Offering based on the current status of its business. 
Future events, including changes in competitive conditions and the status of 
the Company's business from time to time, may make changes in the allocation of 
the net proceeds of this Offering necessary or desirable. The Company 
anticipates that the remaining proceeds of this Offering will be sufficient to 
fund its operations for the 18 month period following this Offering, although 
the Company's capital requirements are subject to numerous contingencies 
associated with the early-stage of the Company's third generation products. 
Pending application, the net proceeds will be invested in short-term, interest-
bearing investments. Any proceeds received upon exercise of the Underwriters' 
over-allotment option or the Underwriters' Warrant will be added to working 
capital. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The Company continually evaluates potential strategic partners for additional 
applications and broader marketing of its technology. The Company may make 
acquisitions, other investments or may enter into joint venture agreements for 
strategic reasons. 

A substantial part of the potential market for the Company's products are in 
the United States due to the geographic spread, technological sophistication 
and number of potential users of the Company's products. Entering into the 
United States market is a fundamental part of the Company's strategy. The 
Company intends to expand its marketing efforts, both by expanding its sales 
and marketing staff in Europe as well as establishing an office and a sales and 
marketing staff in the United States during 1997."

Working capital is expected to be used to fund future Company acquisitions of 
physician practice assets, for capital equipment and information systems and 
for general corporate purposes, including general and administrative expenses. 
An integral part of the Company's business strategy is to grow through 
acquisitions. Although the Company is evaluating and is engaged in discussions 
in connection with the potential acquisitions of the assets or equity of 
additional ENT physician practices and Related Specialty practices, except with 
respect to the practice assets being acquired in connection with the 
Reorganization, the Company has no agreements relating to any particular 
additional acquisition and there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions 
will be consummated. See ""Risk Factors -- Risks Relating to Acquisitions and 
Managing Growth; Need for Additional Funds; Potential Substantial Leverage,""

principal amount of approximately $1,111,000, plus accrued interest ($7,000 at 
February 28, 1997), of which 45% is guaranteed by Dr. Tritt. This indebtedness 
was incurred in connection with leasehold improvements, expansion of offices and
equipment purchases, matures on July 10, 2001 and accrues annual interest at 
the prime rate less 0.25%, (ii) the Additional Atlanta Practices in the 
aggregate principal amount of $330,000, plus accrued interest ($900 at February 
28, 1997), which was incurred in connection with working capital and equipment 
loans, matures on varying dates and accrues annual interest based upon an index 
above the prime rate and (iii) Birmingham ENT in the aggregate principal amount 
of $110,000, with no accrued interest, which was incurred in connection with 
working capital and the purchase of a vehicle, matures between December 1998 and
March 2000 and accrues annual interest at rates ranging from 7.25% to 8%. 
Certain of the indebtedness has been incurred since December 31, 1996.

$598,000, plus accrued interest ($26,780 at February 28, 1997), owed to Atlanta 
ENT, officers and principal stockholders of the Company and two entities whose 
principal stockholders were former directors of the Company, (i) $578,000 of

(primarily computer hardware) of the ENT Networks and is evidenced by a 
promissory note maturing on the earlier of completion of the Offering or June

The consulting fee is payable on the closing of the Offering to Premier 
HealthCare, an affiliate of Gerald R. Benjamin, the Vice Chairman of the Board

the Offering and the Reorganization. 

Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds of this 
Offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities. 
The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of the

REPAYMENT OF CONVERTIBLE BRIDGE NOTES. Approximately $5,104,000 of the net 
proceeds will be used to pay principal and accrued interest on the Company's 
subordinated promissory notes issued in December 1996, assuming none of the 
principal amount of such notes is converted into Common Stock. Up to 20% of the 
principal amount of each such note is convertible for a period of 30 days after 
the effective date of the registration statement of which this Prospectus forms 
a part, at the option of the holder thereof, into the Company's Common Stock at 
a conversion price of 80% of the Price to Public in this offering. To the 
extent that any principal amount of such notes is converted, the net proceeds 
that would have been used to repay such principal amount will be used for 
general working capital purposes. The outstanding principal and accrued 
interest on such notes will be due and payable on June 30, 1997; provided, that 
the Company may extend such maturity to December 31, 1997, and provided, 
further, that the outstanding principal and accrued interest on such notes will 
be due and payable in full within 30 days after the effective date of the 
registration statement of which this Prospectus forms a part. Such notes bear 
interest at the rate of 10% per annum. Such notes were purchased by various 
investors, none of whom are ""affiliates"" of the Company. The proceeds from such 
notes were used to pay off approximately $2,030,000 outstanding under bank 
lines of credit, $1,500,000 of which was personally guaranteed by George E. 
Kline, a director of the Company, and for general working capital purposes. See 
""Description of Capital Stock--Bridge Loans."" 

REPAYMENT OF AFFILIATE BRIDGE NOTES. The Company entered into a series of 
transactions from July through September 1996 resulting in unsecured loans of 
which approximately $1,420,000 in principal and accrued interest is currently 
outstanding, $1,314,000 of which is due to entities affiliated with George E. 
Kline, a director of the Company. The remaining amount is due to a 
nonaffiliate. These loans bear interest at rates from 10% to 12% per annum. The 
proceeds from the short-term loans were used for general working capital 
purposes. See ""Certain Transactions"" and ""Description of Capital Stock--Bridge 
Loans."" 

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. The Company intends to spend approximately $1,000,000 in 
1997 on capital expenditures, including the procurement of injection molding 
tools for the production of the 5000 Series chassis and for leasehold 
improvements to the expanded facilities that the Company anticipates requiring 
in mid-1997. 

WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. The remainder of the net 
proceeds, approximately $4,675,000 will be allocated to working capital and 
will be used for purposes including the addition of manufacturing and 
administrative infrastructure to support expansion. 

In addition, the Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire 
businesses, products or technologies that management believes may complement 
the Company's operations, although the Company currently has no agreements or 
understandings regarding any such acquisition and is not involved in any 
negotiations with respect to any such transactions. 

The amounts given above are estimates, and the amount and timing of actual 
expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including competition, 
manufacturing activities and the level of market acceptance of the Company's 
products. 

Pending the use of the net proceeds of this offering, the Company will invest 
the funds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities. 
The Company believes that the proceeds of this offering, together with cash on 
hand, interest expected to be earned thereon, and anticipated revenues will be 
sufficient to fund its operations at least through 1997. In order to meet its 
needs beyond such time, the Company may be required to raise additional 
capital. There can be no assurance that sufficient capital will be available if 
and when required on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. See ""Risk 
Factors--Future Capital Needs; Uncertainty of Additional Funding."""

hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by the Company, are estimated to be approximately 
$20.4 million (approximately $23.6 million if the Underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full). Of the net proceeds, the Company estimates that 
approximately $3.2 million will be used to pay the cash portion of the purchase 
price for the Founding Companies, all of which will be paid to former 
stockholders of the Founding Companies. Approximately $518,000 of the proceeds 
will be used to pay certain financial advisory fees incurred by the Founding 
Companies and $88,000 will be used to purchase equipment owned by one of the 
stockholders of the Founding Companies. See ""Certain Transactions."" The balance 
of the net proceeds will be used to repay a portion of the $22.2 million 
outstanding indebtedness of the Founding Companies (the ""Founding Company Debt""). 

The Ridge portion of the Founding Company Debt consists of approximately $9.0 
million owed to stockholders and affiliates that bears interest at the prime 
rate (which at November 30, 1996 was 8.25%) and matures January 3, 2000, and 
approximately $3.3 million borrowed under a line of credit that bears interest 
at the prime rate and matures in June 1997. The Fraser portion of the Founding 
Company Debt consists of approximately $60,000 owed to an affiliate that bears 
interest at 14.0% per annum and matures in January 2005; approximately $45,000 
owed to another affiliate that bears interest at 8.0% per annum and matures in 
December 1997; approximately $3.0 million borrowed under a revolving line of 
credit that bears interest at the prime rate and matures in April 1997; 
approximately $1.5 million borrowed under a note payable to a bank that bears 
interest at the prime rate and is payable in monthly installments through 
maturity in April 1998; and approximately $5.0 million borrowed under a note 
payable to a bank that bears interest at 6.4% and matures on April 15, 1997. 
The Interstate portion of the Founding Company Debt consists of a $343,000 non-
interest bearing note due on demand and payable to the stockholder of 
Interstate. Approximately $8.8 million of the Founding Company Debt was recently
borrowed to fund distributions to the former stockholders of the Founding 
Companies representing S Corporation earnings previously taxed to such holders. 

The Company has recently received a commitment from Bank One to provide the 
Company with a $35.0 million credit facility which may be used for acquisitions,
working capital and other general corporate purposes. Because the net proceeds 
of the Offering are insufficient to repay in full the Founding Company Debt 
while funding the other use of proceeds, the Company intends to supplement the 
proceeds for such purposes by utilizing borrowings under the new credit 
facility, if available, cash flow from operations or by electing to reduce the 
amount of Founding Company Debt repaid. See ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and 
Capital Resources -- Combined."""

The Company anticipates that approximately $18.7 million of the net proceeds 
from the Offerings, including interest earned thereon, will be used to fund 
working capital requirements, including primarily continued development and 
testing of, and clinical trials and marketing activities for the EnSite System,

(1) Advertising and marketing efforts will be centered around a public relations
campaign and strategically placed advertisements in leading paint, paint dealer,

established distributors and contractors and to open additional retail outlets 
in West Central Florida. See ""Business--Marketing and Distribution."" 
(2) Management intends to use these proceeds to locate a suitable production 
facility and to equip this facility with the necessary machinery, tooling, 
furnaces and other items necessary to manufacture evacuated or partially 
evacuated microspheres. These estimates are based solely upon management's prior
experience and no independent engineering or other outside consultant data has 
been utilized to determine these amounts. There is no assurance that the Company
will be successful in its efforts to manufacture evacuated shells. 
See ""Business--Manufacturing Facilities and Techniques."" 
(3) In addition to the repayment of the above amount from the proceeds of this 
offering and the conversion of approximately $598,500 of convertible notes plus 
accrued interest thereon into 373,803 shares of Common Stock, Mr. Pidorenko has 
agreed to personally assume and indemnify the Company against approximately 
$660,000 of principal and accrued interest obligations under certain promissory 
notes. Mr. Pidorenko intends to utilize the proceeds from the sale of his shares
of Common Stock registered under the Prospectus to satisfy such obligations. 
See ""Certain Transactions."" 
(4) Represents proceeds allocated to the development of new products and 
applications utilizing shell technologies beyond paints and coatings. 
(5) Represents funds to purchase automated mixers, sealers and label machines, 
tanks and storage facilities. Also includes leasehold improvements for retail 
outlets. 
(6) Represents the base salaries of Mr. Pidorenko and Mr. Trusty. 
See ""Management--Employment Agreements."" 

The Company anticipates that the Offering proceeds will be sufficient to satisfy
its anticipated cash needs for approximately 12 months following the completion 
of this offering. 

The above amounts and priorities for the use of proceeds represent management's 
estimates based upon currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its 
operations, and does not take into consideration receipt of revenues, if any, 
from operations during such period. Although the Company does not contemplate 
any changes in the proposed use of proceeds, to the extent the Company finds 
that general economic and industry conditions or prevailing business conditions 
vary from those which were assumed in arriving at the amount set forth above, 
the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate the amount shown 
among the above-described categories. 

The Company reserves the right to change the use of the balance of the net 
proceeds if its sales or expenses are materially higher or lower than 
anticipated, if competitive or technological developments occur in the areas of 
energy efficient coatings or other areas of the Company's business which cause 
management to conclude that it would be in the Company's best interest to pursue
alternative products or services, or if an opportunity, not presently known to 
the Company arises to develop additional products or to acquire additional 
products or marketing resources either directly or through the acquisition of 
additional companies. If any of these events should occur, the Company may 
reallocate the net proceeds among their intended applications, or it may use a 
part of the remaining net proceeds to acquire additional products, other 
resources or businesses. 

There are no pending agreements or understandings for any acquisitions. It is 
anticipated that the purchase price of acquisitions which may be undertaken by 
the Company may be paid in cash, by issuance of securities or notes payable to 
the Company or a combination thereof. Funds used for acquisitions may also be 
used to absorb operating expenses of the acquired company, and to pay 
accounting, legal and other expenses of the Company in connection with such 
acquisitions. In seeking a business venture, management will focus upon 
businesses that are complimentary to the Company's shell technology or which 
would be a viable application for commercial utilization of the Company's shell 
technology. The Company will not acquire or merge with a business or corporation
in which the Company's officers, directors, or promoters or their affiliates or 
associates, have any direct or indirect ownership interest. It is anticipated 
that any such acquisitions would involve companies located in the Sunbelt 
region of the United States. See ""Risk Factors--Future Acquisitions."" 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other interest-bearing 
investments."

(1) Advertising and marketing efforts will be centered around a public relations
campaign and strategically placed advertisements in leading paint, paint dealer,
and other related magazines. The Company intends to aggressively solicit 
established distributors and contractors and to open additional retail outlets 
in West Central Florida. See ""Business--Marketing and Distribution."" 
(2) Management intends to use these proceeds to locate a suitable production 
facility and to equip this facility with the necessary machinery, tooling, 
furnaces and other items necessary to manufacture evacuated or partially 
evacuated microspheres. These estimates are based solely upon management's prior
experience and no independent engineering or other outside consultant data has 
been utilized to determine these amounts. There is no assurance that the Company
will be successful in its efforts to manufacture evacuated shells. 
See ""Business--Manufacturing Facilities and Techniques."" 
(3) In addition to the repayment of the above amount from the proceeds of this 
offering and the conversion of approximately $598,500 of convertible notes plus 
accrued interest thereon into 373,803 shares of Common Stock, Mr. Pidorenko has 
agreed to personally assume and indemnify the Company against approximately 
$660,000 of principal and accrued interest obligations under certain promissory 
notes. Mr. Pidorenko intends to utilize the proceeds from the sale of his shares
of Common Stock registered under the Prospectus to satisfy such obligations. 
See ""Certain Transactions."" 
(4) Represents proceeds allocated to the development of new products and 
applications utilizing shell technologies beyond paints and coatings. 
(5) Represents funds to purchase automated mixers, sealers and label machines, 
tanks and storage facilities. Also includes leasehold improvements for retail 
outlets. 
(6) Represents the base salaries of Mr. Pidorenko and Mr. Trusty. 
See ""Management--Employment Agreements."" 

The Company anticipates that the Offering proceeds will be sufficient to satisfy
its anticipated cash needs for approximately 12 months following the completion 
of this offering. 

The above amounts and priorities for the use of proceeds represent management's 
estimates based upon currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its 
operations, and does not take into consideration receipt of revenues, if any, 
from operations during such period. Although the Company does not contemplate 
any changes in the proposed use of proceeds, to the extent the Company finds 
that general economic and industry conditions or prevailing business conditions 
vary from those which were assumed in arriving at the amount set forth above, 
the Company may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate the amount shown 
among the above-described categories. 

The Company reserves the right to change the use of the balance of the net 
proceeds if its sales or expenses are materially higher or lower than 
anticipated, if competitive or technological developments occur in the areas of 
energy efficient coatings or other areas of the Company's business which cause 
management to conclude that it would be in the Company's best interest to pursue
alternative products or services, or if an opportunity, not presently known to 
the Company arises to develop additional products or to acquire additional 
products or marketing resources either directly or through the acquisition of 
additional companies. If any of these events should occur, the Company may 
reallocate the net proceeds among their intended applications, or it may use a 
part of the remaining net proceeds to acquire additional products, other 
resources or businesses. 

There are no pending agreements or understandings for any acquisitions. It is 
anticipated that the purchase price of acquisitions which may be undertaken by 
the Company may be paid in cash, by issuance of securities or notes payable to 
the Company or a combination thereof. Funds used for acquisitions may also be 
used to absorb operating expenses of the acquired company, and to pay 
accounting, legal and other expenses of the Company in connection with such 
acquisitions. In seeking a business venture, management will focus upon 
businesses that are complimentary to the Company's shell technology or which 
would be a viable application for commercial utilization of the Company's shell 
technology. The Company will not acquire or merge with a business or corporation
in which the Company's officers, directors, or promoters or their affiliates or 
associates, have any direct or indirect ownership interest. It is anticipated 
that any such acquisitions would involve companies located in the Sunbelt 
region of the United States. See ""Risk Factors--Future Acquisitions."" 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other interest-bearing 
investments."

Of the net proceeds, up to $10.0 million will be used to repay debt. The entire 
principal amount outstanding under the Company's demand note facility with 
First Union National Bank, which has been used for capital expenditures in 
connection with the build-out of the Company's manufacturing facility, will be 
paid in full. This demand note facility bears interest at a rate equal to the 
six month LIBOR plus 75 basis points (approximately 6.3% at December 31, 1996). 
The remaining net proceeds allocated to debt repayment, if any, will be used to 
repay a portion of the Company's outstanding subordinated notes due May 1, 2001.
 These subordinated notes bear interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum. 
Approximately $8.0 million of the net proceeds are expected to be used for 
capital expenditures to expand the Company's manufacturing facility, and the 
balance of the net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate 
purposes including working capital. The Company may also use a portion of the 
net proceeds to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or 
technologies in the semiconductor sector. Although the Company periodically 
reviews potential acquisition opportunities, there are no current agreements 
with respect to any such transactions. Pending such uses, the net proceeds of 
the Offering will be invested in short-term, investment-grade, income producing 
investments. 

The Company believes that the remaining net proceeds from the Offering and the 
funds available under its demand note facility, which after being repaid will 
be available in its entirety, will be sufficient to fund the Company's 
anticipated facility expansion, and to provide the Company with adequate 
working capital at least through 1997. However, there can be no assurance that 
events in the future will not require the Company to seek additional capital 
sooner or, if so required, that adequate capital will be available on terms 
acceptable to the Company."

(1) The Senior Debentures were issued in January 1997 in a private placement 
to 17 investors, in the aggregate principal amount of $1,115,000. That offering 
was for the purpose of funding infrastructure and equipment purchases, 
expansion of marketing and sales capacity, and for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. The $1,135,000 amount includes an estimated $20,000 in 
interest, which accrues on the Senior Debentures at 6% per annum, payable 
semi-annually. The principal amount is due and payable in January 2000, subject 
to the Company's obligation to prepay the Senior Debentures upon completion of 
an initial public offering of equity securities in the amount of at least 
$5,000,000. 
(2) This represents the current estimate of Management as to the proceeds to be 
used in the development of new technologies to be incorporated within the 
ItemQuest product, including, among other areas of development, the development 
of Internet and World Wide Web capabilities and technological improvements that 
help to position ItemQuest in market segments in addition to the PDM market. 
(3) This represents the estimated amount of proceeds to be used for 
infrastructure and equipment purchases and upgrades. 
A portion of the proceeds from this Offering may also be used to acquire or 
invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use 
complementary technologies. While from time to time the Company evaluates 
potential acquisitions of such businesses, products and technologies, there are 
no present commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition. 

It is currently anticipated that there will be adequate cash and accounts 
receivable available at the time this Offering is completed to fund the entire 
amount of the distribution to the current stockholders in connection with the 
Company's conversion from an S corporation to a C corporation. If that is not 
the case, a portion of the proceeds of this Offering would be used for that 
purpose. See ""Prior S Corporation Status and Distributions."" 

Pending such uses, the Company currently plans to invest the net proceeds in 
investment grade, short-term, interest-bearing debt securities. 

The Company believes, based upon its current plans, that its existing capital 
resources, including the net proceeds of this Offering, will be sufficient to 
meet its cash needs for at least 24 months after this Offering. See, however,

$755,500 from the sale of the Units and the Underwriting Discount, are estimated
to be $7,344,500. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the
Offering Costs would be $796,000 and the Net Proceeds would be $8,519,000.
     Approximately $4,275,000 of such Net Proceeds will be used to consummate
the NYPF Business Combination. Of the remaining Net Proceeds, $518,000 will be
used to retire the aggregate amount of the Private Debt. The Private Debt
includes $330,000 of Lender Options bearing simple interest at an annual rate of
12% and $40,000 of debt bearing simple interest at an annual rate of 12%. The
holders of the Private Debt are persons unaffiliated with the Company. The
proceeds of the Private Debt provided interim working capital, were used to pay
a portion of the Offering Costs and were used to fund an initial portion of the
purchase price for the NYPF Business Combination. The Company may but is not
obligated to satisfy an additional $300,000 of debt incurred in February 1997
(the ""February Debt""). The February Debt is held by persons unaffiliated with
the Company and the proceeds of the February Debt were used to pay a portion of
the Offering Costs and to fund an additional portion of the purchase price for

annual rate of 18% and is payable interest only commencing June 1, 1997. The
principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest is due and payable by the
Company on December 31, 2001. In the event the Company satisfies the February
1997 Debt earlier than December 31, 2001, the Company is obligated to pay to the
holders of the February Debt a pre-payment amount (the ""Prepayment Amount"")
equivalent to 22 months of accrued interest if paid on or prior to October 31,
1997; 18 months of accrued interest if paid subsequent to October 31, 1997 but
before February 10, 1998; 12 months of accrued interest if paid subsequent to
February 10, 1998 but before July 31, 1998 and; 6 months of accrued interest if
paid subsequent to August 1, 1998 but before February 10, 1999. The Prepayment
Amount is payable at the option of the Company, by delivery by the Company to
the holder of the February 1997 Debt, shares of the Company's Common Stock equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Prepayment Amount divided by (y)
(.66) multiplied by the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock,
referenced as the average of the last sales price of the shares of Common Stock
for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the date of the calculation,
provided, however, the Company may not issue in excess of 50,000 shares of its
Common Stock in connection with the Prepayment Amount. Approximately $2,551,500

determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
such net proceeds will be between $11.0 million and $15.0 million (or up to 
$17.3 million in the event of an increase in the aggregate pro forma market 
value of the Common Stock of up to 15% above the maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range. See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion Stock Pricing and 
Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such 
amounts. 

The net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock in the Conversion will 
substantially increase the capital of Peoples Federal and will be used for 
general corporate purposes including its lending and investment activities and 
possible expansion of its facilities. For information on the amount of pro 
forma net proceeds assuming the sale of various amounts of Common Stock, see 
""Pro Forma Data."" 

While the new capital resulting from the Conversion could increase the 
Association's return on assets (as a result of the earnings on the new 
capital), it will probably result in a decline in return on equity because it 
is unlikely that the Association will quickly be able to (i) invest the new 
capital in assets with rates equal to the average rates earned on the 
Association's seasoned asset portfolio and (ii) leverage the new capital by 
increasing liabilities to fund asset growth. 

In exchange for all of the common stock of Peoples Federal issued upon 
conversion, the Holding Company will contribute to Peoples Federal 
approximately 50% of the net proceeds from the sale of the Holding Company's 
Common Stock and the Holding Company will retain the remaining 50% of the net 
proceeds. On an interim basis, the proceeds will be invested by the Holding 
Company and Peoples Federal in short-term investments or to repay borrowings. 
Such short-term investments are generally anticipated to be similar to those 
currently contained in the Association's portfolio. The specific types and 
amounts of short-term assets will be determined based on market conditions at 
the time of the completion of the Conversion. In addition, the Holding Company, 
subject to regulatory approval, is expected to provide the funding for the ESOP 
loan. See ""Business - Lending Activities"" and "" - Investment Activities"" and 
""Management of the Association - Benefit Plans - Employee Stock Ownership 
Plan."" 

In the future the Holding Company may consider the adoption of a restricted 
stock plan (i.e., the RRP), at the earliest, one-year following the Conversion 
and subject to stockholder ratification. If such a plan is implemented, the 
Holding Company may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund the purchase by 
the plan of the Holding Company's Common Stock. 
After the completion of the Conversion, it is anticipated that the Association 
will reinvest the proceeds of the interim short-term investments in loans and, 
to a lesser extent, investment securities. Proceeds reinvested in loans are 
anticipated to be allocated among the Association's loan programs in 
proportions similar to recent lending volumes, provided suitable opportunities 
are available to the Association. Investment securities are anticipated to be 
similar to those in the Association's current portfolio. However, the 
reinvestment of the proceeds will be based on future market conditions and 
investment opportunities. The timing and amount of such investments cannot now 
be determined nor can the Association identify the specific assets in which 
investments will be made. 

The proceeds may also be utilized by the Holding Company to repurchase (at 
prices which may be above or below the initial offering price) shares of the 
Common Stock through an open market repurchase program available to all 
stockholders subject to limitations contained in OTS regulations, although the 
Holding Company currently has no specific plan to repurchase any of its stock. 
In the future, the Board of Directors of the Holding Company will make 
decisions on the repurchase of the Common Stock based on its view of the 
appropriateness of the price of the Common Stock as well as the Holding 
Company's and the Association's investment opportunities and capital needs. 
Under current OTS regulations, no repurchases may be made within the first year 
following Conversion except with OTS approval under 
""exceptional circumstances."" During the second and third years following 
Conversion, OTS regulations permit, subject to certain limitations, the 
repurchase of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of stock during each twelve-
month period with a greater amount permitted with OTS approval. In general, the 
OTS regulations do not restrict repurchases thereafter other than indirectly by 
virtue of limits on the Association's ability to pay dividends to the Holding 
Company which may be necessary to fund the repurchase. For a description of the 
restrictions on the Association's ability to provide the Holding Company with 
funds through dividends or other distributions, see ""Dividends"" and ""The 
Conversion -Restrictions on Repurchase of Stock."" 

The Holding Company or Peoples Federal may consider expansion through the 
acquisition of other financial services providers (or branches, deposits or 
assets thereof), although there are no specific plans, negotiations or written 
or oral agreements regarding any acquisitions at this time. In general, the 
Board will evaluate acquisition and diversification opportunities, if any, by 
whether they would enhance the Holding Company's and the Association's ability 
to fulfill their financial goals. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" The Holding Company may use 
remaining net proceeds to engage in activities not permissible for the 
Association. See ""Regulation - Holding Company Regulation."""

Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately 
$18,545,000 ($21,474,500 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full), based on the initial public offering price of $10.50 per 
share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by the Company. 

The Company estimates that approximately $4-5 million of the net proceeds will 
be used to purchase equipment for, and to otherwise establish, a manufacturing 
capability in the U.S. and to expand manufacturing capacity in Finland, 
approximately $3-4 million will be used to develop maxillo-facial products and 
to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure for such products, 
approximately $6-8 million will be used for the development of new resorbable 
polymers, the development of additional product applications in the fields of 
urology and spinal fixation, and related clinical and regulatory support, and 
the balance of $1.5-5.5 million (or approximately $4.5-8.5 million if the 
Underwriters' overallotment option is exercised in full) will be used for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the repayment 
of certain long-term debt. The foregoing represents estimates only; the actual 
amounts expended by the Company for these purposes and the timing of such 
expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the status of the 
Company's development efforts, actions relating to patent and regulatory 
matters, the extent to which the Company's products gain market acceptance and 
competition. The long-term debt to be repaid consists of approximately $440,000 
in loans from Finnish financial institutions maturing from 1997 to 2000 at 
interest rates ranging from 6% to 13% per annum. The Company may use a portion 
of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products or 
technologies, although the Company currently has no agreements and is not 
involved in any negotiations with respect to any such transactions. Pending use 
of the net proceeds of this Offering, the Company plans to invest the net 
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment grade securities. The Company intends 
to invest in liquid assets in a manner that will not subject it to regulation 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Although the Company believes that 
the net proceeds from this Offering, together with cash flows from operations, 
if any, and existing cash and cash equivalents and other capital resources, 
will be sufficient to maintain its current and planned operations through 1998,
 there can be no assurance that the Company will not require additional 
financing within two years. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of

     The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of the allocation of
the net proceeds of the Offering, based on the expected utilization of funds
necessary to finance the Company's existing activities in accordance with
management's current objectives and market conditions. The amounts actually
expended by the Company for each purpose will vary significantly depending on a
number of factors, such as the amount of cash used or generated by the Company's
operations and management's assessment of the Company's specific needs. The
Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering to acquire
new technologies, businesses or products which will result in a reallocation of
the estimated amounts set forth in the table above (which reallocation may be
substantial). While the Company from time to time may evaluate such potential
acquisitions, the Company has no present agreements or commitments with respect
to any such possible acquisition, nor are any negotiations regarding any such
possible acquisitions currently ongoing. Pending such uses, the Company intends
to invest the net proceeds of the Offering in short-term investment grade,
interest bearing obligations. See ""Risk Factors -- No Operating History;

shares of Common Stock being offered hereby by the Company are estimated to be
 $28.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and

 net proceeds, together with approximately $12.6 million of the proceeds from 
its new credit facility (the ""New Credit Facility"") which the Company has entered 
into in conjunction with this Offering (see ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Description of New

Notes"") and the Company's 12% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2001 (the ""Senior
 Subordinated Notes""), as described below. The Company will not receive any of 
the proceeds from shares sold by the Selling Stockholders. 
The Company will use approximately $14.6 million to repay in full amounts due 
under the Senior Revolver, including accrued interest. Of the amounts outstanding 
under the Senior Revolver, $8.0 million bears interest at the Eurodollar Rate 
plus 4.5% per annum (10.0% as of December 31, 1996), with the remainder bearing 
interest at the lender's prime rate plus 3.25% per annum (11.5% as of December
 31, 1996). Amounts outstanding under the Senior Revolver become due on September
 18, 1999. In September 1996, the Company borrowed $5.4 million under the Senior 
Revolver to fund a portion of the ADS purchase price. In December 1996, the 
Company borrowed $1.3 million and $.4 million under the Senior Revolver to fund 
a portion of the purchase prices of Elsinore and the AMP Facility, respectively.
 Of amounts used to repay the Senior Revolver, $10.9 million will be paid to 
ING (U.S.) Capital Corporation (""ING"") and $3.7 million will be paid to The 
Provident Bank (""Provident""). In addition, pursuant to the terms of an agreement 
entered into among the Company, ING and Provident, the Company will pay ING and 
Provident $188,000 and $62,000, respectively, upon consummation of the Offering
 (the ""Success Fee""). ING Baring (U.S.) Securities, Inc. is an affiliate of ING. 
The Company will use approximately $16.5 million to repay in full amounts outstanding 
under the Senior Term Notes, including accrued interest. Of the amounts outstanding 
under the Senior Term Notes, $12.0 million bears interest at the Eurodollar Rate 
plus 5.0% (10.5% as of December 31, 1996) and the remaining portion bears interest 
at a rate equal to 3.5% above the greater of (i) the lender's prime rate or 
(ii) the federal funds rate plus 1.5% (11.8% as of December 31, 1996). The Senior 
Term Notes mature on September 30, 2001 and require quarterly payments of principal 
in varying amounts. The Company issued $5.0 million of Senior Term Notes in 
December 1996 to fund a portion of the purchase price of the AMP Facility. Of
 amounts used to repay the Senior Term Notes, $12.4 million will be paid to ING 
and $4.1 million will be paid to Provident. 
The Company will use approximately $3.0 million to repay in full amounts outstanding 
under the Convertible Notes, including accrued interest. The Convertible Notes
 bear interest at a rate of 15.0% per annum, which is payable quarterly. The 
Company has certain rights to defer cash interest payments. The Convertible Notes

(1) As of December 31, 1996, the Company had $1,138,785 outstanding under its
 bank credit facility. The amounts shown in the table are amounts estimated to
 be outstanding upon completion of the Offering. The amounts outstanding on
 these lines of credit are guaranteed by the Company's principal executive 
officers and stockholders, Bernard F. Reynolds and Eli Salig. The Company's 
lender has agreed to release Messrs. Reynolds and Salig from these guarantees 
in connection with the Offering. Subsequent to the Offering, the Company intends
 to enter into a new bank credit facility which would not be guaranteed. 
(2) These lines of credit mature on September 30, 1997 and carry annual interest 
at the lender's prime rate plus one percent. As of February 28, 1997, the 
interest rate was 9.25%. 
(3) Approximately $393,000 of this amount matures on November 5, 2001 and carries 
an annual rate of interest of 9.65%. The remaining $507,000 of this amount will
 convert to a term loan which will mature on or about February 7, 2002 and which 
will carry an interest rate of 9.25%. 
(4) The Company evaluates potential acquisitions from time to time and believes
 such transactions may offer an attractive method for the Company to expand its
 business. However, the Company presently has no pending commitments or understandings 
to enter into any such transactions. 
Pending application of the net proceeds from the Offering for the foregoing 
purposes, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds in investment grade,
 short-term, interest-bearing securities and cash equivalents."

being offered hereby are estimated to be approximately $25,800,000 
($29,985,000 if the Underwriters' over-allotment options are exercised in 
full). 

The net proceeds of the offering are expected to be used for repayment of 
amounts borrowed by the Company under its revolving credit line and for the 
payment of certain obligations incurred in connection with the Acquisitions. 
Approximately $9.5 million will be used to repay all outstanding borrowings as 
of the date hereof under the revolving credit line. Approximately $4.6 million 
will be used to repay the entire amount due at the offering under an 8% note 
issued by the Company to the founders of an operating subsidiary acquired by 
the Company in September 1995. $5 million will be used to make payments to 
Digital, $3 million of which will be due on June 20, 1997 and $2 million of 
which will be due on the earlier of June 20, 1997 or 10 days after the purchase 
by Digital of $2 million worth of Common Stock offered hereby. The $6.7 million 
balance of the net proceeds is expected to be used to make payments toward the 
$32 million due to Novell in calendar year 1997. Any remaining proceeds will be 
added to working capital and used for general corporate purposes. The Company 
may also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund acquisitions of 
complementary businesses, products or technologies. Pending such uses, the net 
proceeds of the offering will be invested in investment grade, interest-bearing 
instruments. 

The Company believes the net proceeds of the offering together with its current 
cash balances, borrowings available under its lines of credit and cash flow 
from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements, 
including the payment obligations related to the Acquisitions through at least 
January 31, 1998. Thereafter, the Company expects that it will require 
substantial additional capital to meet its $33 million and $12 million payment 
obligations to Novell in 1998 and January 1999, respectively, and its aggregate 
payment obligations to Digital of up to $17 million through February 2000, 
including an $11 million payment due on or before February 1, 2000. See ""Risk

April 1996 to (i) make an $11.0 million term loan to the ESOP, the proceeds of 
which were used by the ESOP to purchase the Company's Series B Common Stock 
from senior management, (ii) repay approximately $2.0 million in subordinated 
notes outstanding to certain senior management stockholders of the Company, 
(iii) repay approximately $600,000 of bank term debt and (iv) pay $1.1 million

Preferred Stock has a cumulative 14% dividend on the $6.0 million redemption 
amount, a liquidation preference and a five-year mandatory redemption provision.
 In addition, the Company intends to use approximately $8.2 million of the net 
proceeds to repay the term note payable to Fleet Capital Corporation which 
bears interest at the bank's base rate (equivalent to prime) plus 0.75% with 
annual principal of $1.6 million payable in defined quarterly amounts for five 
years with any remaining principal and interest due in full at the end of the 
five years. The Company intends to use the remaining proceeds for general 
working capital purposes. 

Pending use of the proceeds from the Offering, the Company will invest the 
funds in investment grade interest-bearing securities, including government 
obligations and other money market instruments. See ""Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and

offered hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses,

allotment option is exercised in full). The Company intends to use all of the 
estimated net proceeds to repay indebtedness that will be outstanding under the 
Company's Bank Credit Facility (as hereinafter defined) at the time of the 
Offering. This indebtedness represents borrowings to fund (i) the Dolphin 
Acquisition, (ii) certain capital expenditures that were made in 1996 and 1997 
to improve the Company's facilities and the productivity of its workforce and 
(iii) the Shareholder Distributions, which are expected to be approximately 
$16.6 million. The Shareholder Distributions will be made prior to the 
completion of this Offering. See ""Prior S Corporation Status"" and ""Certain 
Transactions."" 

The Company's credit facility (the ""Bank Credit Facility"") currently provides 
for (i) a revolving line of credit of up to $20.0 million and (ii) a non-
revolving facility of $15.0 million. The revolving portion matures on December 
31, 1999 and will be available to fund the Shareholder Distributions. The non-
revolving facility, which was originated on October 24, 1996 and was amended 
and increased on January 2, 1997 in connection with the Dolphin Acquisition, 
may be drawn upon by the Company until June 30, 1997, at which time the non-
revolving facility will convert to a term loan with a final maturity of June 
30, 2004. Both portions bear interest equal to, at the Company's option, the 
prime lending rate established by Citibank, N.A. or LIBOR plus 2%. The weighted 
average interest rate on the indebtedness outstanding under the Bank Credit 
Facility as of March 1, 1997 was 8.0%. After the Offering and the application 
of the estimated net proceeds as described herein, the Company expects to have 
approximately $16.5 million available under the revolving portion of the Bank 
Credit Facility. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial

(1) Consists of costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with purchasing
    CST components for use in connection with initial demonstrations and/or
    installations of CST at customer sites.
(2) Includes the hiring of additional personnel (including marketing personnel)
    and the costs associated with conducting ongoing tests, demonstrations and
    enhancements of CST. See ""Business -- Research and Development.""
(3) Consists of costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with purchasing
    the equipment or licensing technology necessary to manufacture the modules
    and produce the proprietary chemicals used in CST. See ""Business -- Proposed

(4) Expenditures in respect of collaborative arrangements will include salaries
    and benefits of personnel, equipment design and procurement costs, costs of
    leasing or otherwise obtaining additional operating facilities, analytical
    and other testing costs, professional fees, insurance and other
    administrative expenses. In each arrangement, personnel expenses may be
    expected to account for at least 50% of the costs of each collaborative
    arrangement, and equipment costs are likely to constitute the next largest
    component of expenditures. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Company
    has not determined the amount of net proceeds of this Offering to be applied
    to any one particular proposed collaborative arrangement because the Company
    is currently in negotiations with a number of companies involving, among
    other issues, the level of its proposed funding commitment. The estimated
    allocation of the net proceeds for funding of proposed collaborative
    arrangements is on an aggregate basis. In addition, in the event a
    definitive agreement is not entered into by the Company and Teledyne Brown
    or Sverdrup, respectively, on or before August 31, 1997, such memorandum of
    understanding may be terminated by either company upon written notice. See

(5) Consists of remaining costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with
    equipping a new facility of approximately 20,000 square feet near Atlanta,
    Georgia, which the Company has leased and began occupying in March 1997 and
    which will comprise the Company's administrative offices, research and

(6) Represents a line of credit bearing interest at the prime lending rate
    (8.25% at March 17, 1997) provided by a commercial bank to the Company in
    March 1997 and expiring on April 17, 1997, which is guaranteed by Applied
    and secured by cash collateral provided by Applied. Upon completion of this
    Offering, the Company will apply $1,500,000 of the net proceeds to repay
    such line of credit. The line of credit had been used
    by the Company to repay advances made by Applied to the Company since
    December 1, 1996 for providing equipment installed in the Company's new
    Atlanta facility and for working capital purposes. See ""Certain
    Relationships and Related Transactions -- Loans Involving Affiliates.""
(7) Working capital and general corporate purposes include amounts required to
    pay officers' salaries, professional fees, ongoing public reporting costs,
    ongoing license fees and royalties, office-related expenses and other
    corporate expenses, including interest and overhead. The Company may also
    allocate up to one-third of its available working capital (approximately
    $900,000) to finance a portion of the purchase price relating to possible
    acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary (including competitive)
    businesses, products or technologies. The Company currently has no
    commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions or
    investments. In the event any such acquisition or investment opportunity
    arises in the future, it is probable that the Company will also be required
    to obtain additional financing to complete such transaction. See ""Risk
    Factors -- Unspecified Acquisition-Related Risks"" and ""-- Potential Need for
    Additional Financing.""
   In the event the Over-allotment Option is exercised, the Company intends to
enter into a two-year revolving credit agreement with Commodore. Pursuant to
such agreement, the Company may lend the net proceeds, if any, from the exercise
of the Over-allotment Option (estimated to be up to approximately $1,830,285) to
Commodore for its working capital needs. In the event that the Company does not
consummate the revolving credit agreement, such funds will be utilized by the
Company for working capital and general corporate purposes. See ""Risk Factors --
Control by Principal Stockholder; Loans Involving Affiliates,"" ""Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations --

Transactions -- Loans Involving Affiliates.""
   The Company believes that the net proceeds of this Offering will be
sufficient to meet its cash, operational and liquidity requirements for a
minimum of 12 months after the date of this Prospectus. While the initial
allocation of the net proceeds of this Offering represents the Company's best
estimates of their use, the amounts actually expended for these purposes may
vary significantly from the specific allocation of the net proceeds set forth
above, depending on numerous factors, including changes in the general economic
and/or regulatory climate, and the progress and market acceptance of the
Company's technology. See ""Risk Factors -- Management's Broad Discretion in
Application of Proceeds."" However, there can be no assurance that the net
proceeds of the Offering will satisfy the Company's requirements for any
particular period of time. The Company anticipates that, after 12 months from
the receipt of the net proceeds of this Offering, additional funding may be
needed. No assurance can be given that such additional financing will be
available on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. See ""Risk Factors --
Potential Need for Additional Financing."" Pending specific allocation of the net
proceeds of this Offering, the net proceeds will be invested in short-term,
investment grade, interest-bearing obligations."
HEMLOCK FEDERAL FINANCIAL CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/hemlock-federal-financial-corp-9746-8296,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/hemlock-federal-financial-corp-9746-8296,424B2,2/25/1997,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=761155,"Although the actual net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock cannot be 
determined until the Conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
such net proceeds will be between $12.8 million and $17.5 million (or up to 
$20.1 million in the event of an increase in the aggregate pro forma market 
value of the Common Stock of up to 15% above the maximum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion Stock Pricing and 
Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such 
amounts. 

In exchange for all of the common stock of Hemlock Federal issued upon 
conversion, the Holding Company will contribute approximately 50% of the net 
proceeds from the sale of the Holding Company's Common Stock to Hemlock 
Federal. On an interim basis, the proceeds will be invested by the Holding 
Company and Hemlock Federal in short-term investments similar to those 
currently in the Bank's portfolio. The specific types and amounts of short-
term assets will be determined based on market conditions at the time of the 
completion of the Conversion. In addition, the Holding Company intends to 
provide the funding for the ESOP loan. Based upon the initial Purchase Price of 
$10.00 per share, the dollar amount of the ESOP loan would range from $1.1 
million (based upon the sale of shares at the minimum of the Estimated 
Valuation Range) to $1.4 million (based upon the sale of shares at the maximum 
of the Estimated Valuation Range). The interest rate to be charged by the 
Holding Company on the ESOP loan will be based upon the IRS prescribed 
applicable federal rate at the time of origination. It is anticipated that the 
ESOP will repay the loan through periodic tax-deductible contributions from the
Bank over a ten-year period. 

In the event the Foundation is approved by the Bank's members, the Holding 
Company will contribute an aggregate of $1.0 million to the Foundation. See 
""The Conversion - Establishment of a Charitable Foundation."" 

The net proceeds received by Hemlock Federal will become part of Hemlock 
Federal's general funds for use in its business and will be used to support the
 Bank's existing operations, subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. 
Immediately upon the completion of the Conversion, it is anticipated that the 
Bank will invest such proceeds into short-term assets. Subsequently, the Bank 
will redirect the net proceeds to the origination of loans, subject to market 
conditions. In addition, the Bank may direct a portion of the proceeds towards 
the establishment of a new branch office in the southwestern suburbs of 
Chicago, although the Bank had no specific plans regarding any such new office 
as of the date hereof. 

After the completion of the Conversion, the Holding Company will redirect the 
net proceeds invested by it in short-term assets into a variety of mortgage-
backed securities and other securities similar to those already held by the 
Bank. Also, the Holding Company may use a portion of the proceeds to fund the 
RRP, subject to shareholder approval of such plan. Compensation expense related 
to the RRP will be recognized as share awards vest. See ""Pro Forma Data."" 
Following stockholder ratification of the RRP, the RRP will be funded either 
with shares purchased in the open market or with authorized but unissued 
shares. Based upon the initial Purchase Price of $10.00 per share, the amount 
required to fund the RRP through open-market purchases would range from 
approximately $533,800 (based upon the sale of shares at the minimum of the 
Estimated Valuation Range) to approximately $722,200 (based upon the sale of 
shares at the maximum of the Estimated Valuation Range). In the event that the 
per share price of the Common Stock increases above the $10.00 per share 
Purchase Price following completion of the Offering, the amount necessary to 
fund the RRP would also increase. The use of authorized but unissued shares to 
fund the RRP could dilute the holdings of stockholders who purchase Common 
Stock in the Conversion. See ""Business - Lending Activities"" and "" - Investment 
Activities"" and ""Management - Benefit Plans - Employee Stock Ownership Plan"" 
and ""- Recognition and Retention Plan."" 
The proceeds may also be utilized by the Holding Company to repurchase (at 
prices which may be above or below the initial offering price) shares of the 
Common Stock through an open market repurchase program subject to limitations 
contained in OTS regulations, although the Holding Company currently has no 
specific plan to repurchase any of its stock. In the future, the Board of 
Directors of the Holding Company will make decisions on the repurchase of the 
Common Stock based on its view of the appropriateness of the price of the 
Common Stock as well as the Holding Company's and the Bank's investment 
opportunities and capital needs. Under current OTS regulations, no repurchases 
may be made within the first year following Conversion except with OTS approval 
under ""exceptional circumstances."" During the second and third years following 
Conversion, OTS regulations permit, subject to certain limitations, the 
repurchase of up to five percent of the outstanding shares of stock during each 
twelve-month period with a greater amount permitted with OTS approval. In 
general, the OTS regulations do not restrict repurchases thereafter, other than 
limits on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Holding Company to fund 
the repurchase. For a description of the restrictions on the Bank's ability to 
provide the Holding Company with funds through dividends or other distributions,
 see ""Dividends"" and ""The Conversion - Restrictions on Repurchase of Stock."" 

The Holding Company or Hemlock Federal might consider expansion through the 
acquisition of other financial services providers (or branches, deposits or 
assets thereof), although there are no specific plans, negotiations or written 
or oral agreements regarding any acquisitions at this time."
CUMBERLAND MOUNTAIN BANCSHARES INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cumberland-mountain-bancshares-inc-5916-8291,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cumberland-mountain-bancshares-inc-5916-8291,424B3,2/21/1997,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4529,"Net proceeds from the sale of the Conversion Stock are estimated to be between 
$2.5 million and $3.5 million ($4.0 million assuming an increase in the 
Valuation Price Range by 15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" as to the assumptions used 
to arrive at such amounts. 

The Company plans to contribute to the Bank all but $100,000 of the net proceeds
of the Offerings (after deduction of the amount necessary to fund the ESOP). 
The net proceeds retained by the Company will be initially used to invest 
primarily in high grade, short-term marketable securities. A portion of net 
proceeds will also be used to make a loan directly to the ESOP to enable the 
ESOP to purchase 4.0% of the shares of Common Stock to be issued in the 
Conversion and Reorganization. Based upon the issuance of 436,784 shares and 
590,943 shares at the minimum and maximum of the Valuation Price Range, 
respectively, the loan to the ESOP would be $174,714 and $236,377, respectively.
It is anticipated the loan to the ESOP will have a term of ten years and a fixed
interest rate at the Prime Rate as of the date of the loan. The net proceeds 
retained by the Company may be used to support the future expansion of 
operations and for other business or investment purposes, including the 
acquisition of other financial institutions and/or branch offices, although 
there are no current plans, arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding
such expansion or acquisitions. Subject to applicable regulatory limitations, 
the Company may use available funds to repurchase shares of Common Stock and to 
pay dividends, although the Company currently has no intention of effecting any 
such transactions following consummation of the Conversion and Reorganization 
and has not adopted a dividend policy. See ""The Conversion and Reorganization --
Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares after the Conversion and 
Reorganization."" The Company may also use available funds or funds received from
the Bank to fund a contribution to the 1997 MRP for the purpose of purchasing a 
number of shares equal to 3.0% of the Conversion Stock. Such contribution would 
equal $114,713 if 382,375 shares of Common Stock (3.0% of the shares of 
Conversion Stock that would be sold at the maximum of the Valuation Price Range)
are purchased at a price of $10.00 per share. The portion of the net proceeds 
contributed to the Bank will be used for general corporate purposes, including 
investment in loans and investment securities. 

Following the one-year anniversary of the completion of the Conversion and 
Reorganization (or sooner if permitted by the OTS), and based upon then existing
facts and circumstances, the Company's Board of Directors may determine to 
repurchase shares of Common Stock, subject to any applicable statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Such facts and circumstances may include, but are not 
limited to: (i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock
is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other 
investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the
investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of 
the remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in the Company's return on
equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue 
additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee 
stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases 
would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Any stock 
repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Company's Board of 
Directors that the Company and the Bank will be capitalized in excess of all 
applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. The payment of 
dividends or repurchasing of stock, however, would be prohibited if 
stockholders' equity would be reduced below the amount required for the 
liquidation account. See ""Dividend Policy"" and ""The Conversion and 
Reorganization -- Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After 
the Conversion."""

From time to time the Company may examine potential opportunities to acquire 
companies engaged in the toy business. The Company currently has no plans to
 make any such acquisitions. Pending use of the net offering proceeds, the 
Company will invest the proceeds in short-term, investment grade, interest- 
bearing securities. 

At January 31, 1997, the Company's outstanding indebtedness under the Bank One 
Loan was $5.0 million. The outstanding indebtedness under the Bank One Loan 
bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate of Bank One, Texas, 
N.A. (""Bank One"") plus 1%, which at March 31, 1997 was 9.5%. The principal of 
the Bank One Loan is payable in quarterly installments of $250,000 with a final
 maturity on December 11, 2000. Repayment of the Bank One Loan is secured by a 
lien on all the Company's assets, 65% of the stock of DSI(HK) held by the 
Company, and the shares of Common Stock held by RAC. The Company intends to use 
a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay all outstanding 
indebtedness under the Bank One Loan. The terms of the Bank One Loan do not 
include any prepayment penalties. 

At January 31, 1997, the Company's outstanding indebtedness under the Revolver 
was $3.1 million. The Company anticipates that the amount of outstanding 
indebtedness at the date of closing of the Offering will be approximately $6.0 
million. The advances under the Revolver have been used by the Company to 
provide working capital, including $3.0 million which was used to pay 
outstanding indebtedness to Mr. Moss and certain expenses incurred in 
connection with the Recapitalization. The outstanding indebtedness under the 
Revolver bears interest at a rate per annum equal to Bank One's prime rate plus 
0.75% and is repayable on May 31, 1998. At March 31, 1997, the outstanding 
indebtedness accrued interest at the rate of 9.25%. See ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--
Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

At January 31, 1997, the Company's outstanding indebtedness under the Hibernia 
Loan was $1.5 million. The outstanding indebtedness under the Hibernia Loan 
bears interest at 13% per annum. The principal of the Hibernia Loan is payable 
in quarterly installments of $75,000 and a final maturity on January 31, 2002. 
Repayment of principal prior to the scheduled date of repayment requires a 
prepayment penalty of 4% of any principal amount prepaid prior to January 31, 
1998 and 3% of any principal amount prepaid thereafter. The Hibernia Loan is 
secured by a subordinated lien on all the Company's assets and is subordinated 
to the Bank One Loan and the Revolver. For more information regarding the Bank 
One Loan, the Moss Note and the Hibernia Loan, see ""The Recapitalization"" and 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

At January 31, 1997, the Company's outstanding indebtedness under the Moss Note 
was $6.0 million. The outstanding indebtedness under the Moss Note currently 
bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum. The principal due under the Moss 
Note is payable in $1.0 million annual installments beginning on March 31, 
1998, with an additional $1.0 million installment due December 31, 2000, with 
the full amount of outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest due upon 
the earlier of the third business day after the closing of the Company's 
initial public offering or March 31, 2001. 
At January 31, 1997, the Company's outstanding indebtedness under the Moss 
Bonus Note was $1.0 million. The outstanding indebtedness under the Moss Bonus
 Note currently bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum. The principal of 
the Moss Bonus Note is payable on the earlier to occur of the third business 
day after the closing of the Company's initial public offering or May 31, 1997. 

The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Common 
Stock by the Selling Shareholder. In the event the Underwriters' over- 
allotment option is exercised in full, the Company will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares by Hibernia Corporation, but will receive 
$300,000 upon exercise of the warrants related to such shares."

the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting 
the underwriting discount, the non-accountable expense allowance and other 
estimated expenses of the Offering payable by the Company. 

The Company anticipates that approximately $5,100,000 of the net proceeds will 
be used for increased marketing and sales efforts, approximately $6,800,000 
will be used for additional research and development efforts and approximately 
$2,000,000 for capital expenditures. The balance of the net proceeds will be 
used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Furthermore, 
from time to time the Company expects to evaluate possible acquisitions of or 
investments in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to 
those of the Company, for which a portion of the net proceeds from this 
offering may be used. While the Company engages from time to time in 
discussions with respect to potential investments or acquisitions, the Company 
has no plans, commitments, or agreements with respect to any such investments 
or acquisitions. Pending such uses, the Company intends to invest the net 
proceeds of this Offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
securities. 

The Company believes that the net proceeds of this Offering, together with its 
existing capital resources and anticipated revenues from operations, will be 
sufficient to enable it to maintain its current and planned operations for a 
period of at least 12 months after consummation of the Offering. See

exercised in full), at a public offering price of $9.00 per Unit and after 
deducting the underwriting discounts, the non-accountable expense allowance and 
the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. 

The net proceeds will allow the Company to reduce seasonal borrowings under the 
Revolving Credit Facility. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources"" 
for information regarding interest payable on and the maturity date of 
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Substantially all indebtedness 
incurred under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility is used to fund the 
Company's peak working capital needs which typically occur during the period 
from August through early December. As of February 1, 1997, the Company had no 
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company plans to use the 
net proceeds to fund anticipated capital expenditures, including building new 
stores ($2.5 million), remodeling existing stores ($2.0 million), developing 
and implementing new information systems ($1.5 million), testing new business 
concepts ($0.5 million), and for working capital purposes ($1.8 million). 


In addition to the net proceeds to be derived from the sale of the Units, the 
Company may derive as much as $17,077,500 or as little as nothing from the 
exercise of the Redeemable Warrants included in the Units. Any amounts that the 
Company derives from the exercise of such securities are expected to be used to 
reduce seasonal borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and in

working capital requirements. See ""Risk Factors--Current Prospectus and State

over-allotment option is exercised in full). 

The Company will use approximately $8.3 million of the net proceeds to repay 
principal with respect to certain indebtedness which was incurred to finance 
certain of the Company's acquisitions and for working capital purposes. Such 
indebtedness bears interest at rates ranging from 7.7% to 12.0%, has a weighted
 average interest rate of 9.6% and matures at various dates through March 1, 
2001. Such indebtedness includes approximately $1.1 million in principal to be 
repaid to Yerac Associates, L.P. (""Yerac"") and approximately $912,000 to be 
paid to PNC Capital Corp. (""PNC""). Vincent A. Wolfington, the Company's Chairman
 of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Don R. Dailey, President and a 
director of the Company, have personally guaranteed $3.7 million of the 
Company's indebtedness which will be repaid from the net proceeds of this

the underlying indebtedness. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The Company currently intends to use approximately $7.1 million of the net 
proceeds of this offering to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the 
acquisition of Manhattan Limousine. The Company also will utilize approximately 
$3.5 million of the net proceeds to repay certain indebtedness assumed upon the 
acquisition of Manhattan Limousine. 

Approximately $3.1 million of the net proceeds will be used by the Company to 
redeem all outstanding shares of its Series A and Series F Preferred Stock and 
certain shares of its Series G Preferred Stock in connection with the 
Recapitalization. Of this amount, $1.1 million will be paid to entities 
affiliated with Hambrecht & Quist Group in connection with the redemption of 
22,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by those entities, $1.0 million 
will be paid to IBJS Capital Corporation in connection with the redemption of 
its 10,000 shares of Series F and 3,000 shares of Series G Preferred Stock, and 
$20,250 and $13,650, respectively, will be paid to each of Messrs. Wolfington 
and Dailey in connection with the redemption of 405 shares and 273 shares of 
Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, beneficially owned by each of them. See 
""Recapitalization"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 

The balance of the net proceeds from this offering, approximately $5.1 million, 
will be used for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, including 
working capital. Except for the acquisition of Manhattan Limousine, the Company 
currently has no existing commitment or agreement with respect to any

Stock offered by it (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses that have not yet been paid) are estimated to be 
approximately $27.0 million (approximately $31.3 million if the Underwriters' 
over-allotment option is exercised in full). 

The Company will use approximately $8.3 million of the net proceeds to repay 
principal with respect to certain indebtedness which was incurred to finance 
certain of the Company's acquisitions and for working capital purposes. Such 
indebtedness bears interest at rates ranging from 7.7% to 12.0%, has a weighted
 average interest rate of 9.6% and matures at various dates through March 1, 
2001. Such indebtedness includes approximately $1.1 million in principal to be 
repaid to Yerac Associates, L.P. (""Yerac"") and approximately $912,000 to be 
paid to PNC Capital Corp. (""PNC""). Vincent A. Wolfington, the Company's Chairman
 of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Don R. Dailey, President and a 
director of the Company, have personally guaranteed $3.7 million of the 
Company's indebtedness which will be repaid from the net proceeds of this 
offering. These personal guarantees will be terminated upon the repayment of 
the underlying indebtedness. See ""Certain Transactions."" 

The Company currently intends to use approximately $7.1 million of the net 
proceeds of this offering to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the 
acquisition of Manhattan Limousine. The Company also will utilize approximately 
$3.5 million of the net proceeds to repay certain indebtedness assumed upon the 
acquisition of Manhattan Limousine. 

Approximately $3.1 million of the net proceeds will be used by the Company to 
redeem all outstanding shares of its Series A and Series F Preferred Stock and 
certain shares of its Series G Preferred Stock in connection with the 
Recapitalization. Of this amount, $1.1 million will be paid to entities 
affiliated with Hambrecht & Quist Group in connection with the redemption of 
22,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by those entities, $1.0 million 
will be paid to IBJS Capital Corporation in connection with the redemption of 
its 10,000 shares of Series F and 3,000 shares of Series G Preferred Stock, and 
$20,250 and $13,650, respectively, will be paid to each of Messrs. Wolfington 
and Dailey in connection with the redemption of 405 shares and 273 shares of 
Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, beneficially owned by each of them. See 
""Recapitalization"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 

The balance of the net proceeds from this offering, approximately $5.1 million, 
will be used for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, including 
working capital. Except for the acquisition of Manhattan Limousine, the Company 
currently has no existing commitment or agreement with respect to any 
acquisition. The Company regularly reviews potential acquisition candidates and 
has held preliminary discussions with a number of such candidates.

Offering expenses (excluding the repayment of the entire principal and interest

Acquisitions and the Offering)) are estimated to be approximately $14.8 million 
(approximately $17.1 million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is

Of the $14.8 million of net proceeds, the Company intends to use (i)

The Convertible Notes were issued in connection with loans made by TriCap in 
the aggregate amount of $2.6 million to fund Apple's organizational and other 
expenses incurred prior to the completion of the Offering. The Convertible 
Notes bear interest at an average rate of 8.5% per annum and are convertible, 
at the option of either Apple or TriCap, into shares of Common Stock at a 
conversion price of $11.00 per share. Apple does not currently intend to 
exercise its conversion rights with respect to the Convertible Notes and, based 
on a written representation received from TriCap, does not expect TriCap to 
exercise its conversion rights. Assuming the Convertible Notes are not 
converted, the indebtedness represented thereby will mature and become due on 
the closing of the Offering."

depend upon the total number of shares actually sold in the Subscription 
Offering and the Community Offering and the Syndicated Community Offering, if 
any, and the actual expenses of the Conversion. As a result, the actual net 
proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock cannot be determined until the 
Conversion is completed. Based on the sale of $3,200,000 of Common Stock at the 
midpoint of the Estimated Valuation Range, the net proceeds from the sale of 
the Common Stock are estimated to be approximately $2,850,000. The Company has 
received regulatory approval from the OTS to purchase all of the capital stock 
of the Converted Association to be issued in the Conversion in exchange for at 
least 50% of the net proceeds. Based on the foregoing assumption and the 
purchase of 8% of the shares to be issued in the Conversion by the ESOP, the 
Association would receive approximately $1,425,000 in cash, and the Company 
would retain approximately $1,169,000 in cash and $256,000 in the form of a 
note receivable from the ESOP. The ESOP note receivable will be for a ten-year 
term and carry an interest rate, which adjusts annually, equal to the prime 
rate as published in The Wall Street Journal plus one percent. 

The proceeds retained by the Company, after funding the ESOP, initially will be 
invested in short-term and intermediate-term securities including cash and cash 
equivalents and U.S. government and agency obligations. Such proceeds will be 
available for a variety of corporate purposes, including funding the MRP, if 
implemented, future acquisitions and diversification of business, additional 
capital contributions, dividends to stockholders and future repurchases of the 
Common Stock to the extent permitted by applicable regulations. The Company 
currently has no specific plans, intentions, arrangements or understandings 
regarding acquisitions, capital contributions, dividends or repurchases. Due to 
the limited nature of the Company's business activities, the Company believes 
that the net proceeds retained after the Conversion, earnings on such proceeds 
and payments on the ESOP note receivable will be adequate to meet the Company's 
financial needs until dividends are paid by the Converted Association. However, 
no assurance can be given that the Company will not have a need for additional 
funds in the future.

The proceeds contributed to the Converted Association will ultimately become 
part of the Converted Association's general corporate funds to be used for its 
business activities, including making loans and investments. Initially it is 
expected that the proceeds will be invested in short-term and intermediate-term 
securities including cash and cash equivalents and U.S. government and agency 
obligations. The additional capital will also provide the Association with 
additional liquidity to improve the Association's interest rate risk position 
and ""cushion"" the effect of a significant increase in interest rates. The 
Converted Association ultimately plans to use such proceeds primarily to 
originate loans in the ordinary course of business. 

Following the one-year anniversary of the completion of the Conversion 
(or sooner if permitted by the OTS), and based upon then existing facts and 
circumstances, the Company's Board of Directors may determine to repurchase 
shares of Common Stock, subject to any applicable statutory and regulatory 
requirements. Such facts and circumstances may include, but are not limited to: 
(i) market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in the Company's return on 
equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue 
additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee 
stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other circumstances in which repurchases 
would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Any stock 
repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Company's Board of 
Directors that the Company and the Association will be capitalized in excess of 
all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. The payment 
of dividends or repurchasing of stock, however, would be prohibited if 
stockholders' equity would be reduced below the amount required for the 
liquidation account. See ""Dividend Policy"" and ""The Conversion -- Certain 
Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of Shares After the Conversion.""

At December 31, 1996, the Company's outstanding balance under the revolving 
credit note issued to Congress Financial Corporation (Southwest) (""Congress"") 
was $1.46 million. The advances under this note have been used by the Company 
to provide working capital. The outstanding indebtedness under this note bears 
interest at a rate equal to Core States Bank prime rate plus 1.25% and is 
repayable on December 31, 1998. The Company's outstanding indebtedness under 
the Congress mortgage term loan bears interest at prime rate plus 1.5% per annum
and matures on December 31, 1998. 

On December 31, 1996, the Company had outstanding indebtedness to The Webworks, 
Inc. of $510,000. This indebtedness bears interest at 12% per annum and is 
repayable in installments of $100,000 on September 12, 1997 and September 12, 
1998 and $310,000 on September 12, 1999. 

The Company's note to Robert L. Jensen (seller of Newspaper Enterprises, Inc.) 
bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum and matures on February 28, 1999. 
This note is not secured and is subordinated to all of the Company's 
indebtedness to senior lenders. 

The Company will utilize an estimated $580,000 of the net proceeds for the 
relocation and installation of the assets acquired from Webworks to the 
Company's facilities and an additional $170,000 for related capital 
improvements. See ""Business--Facilities and Capabilities."" 

The balance of the net proceeds will be used for general working capital 
purposes and capital expenditures, including possible acquisitions of additional
printing operations. The Company does not have any present agreements or 
understandings regarding any such acquisitions. The Company plans to make 
capital purchases of approximately $2.0 million after completion of the 
relocation of certain of its assets to its facilities to increase its pre-press 
and post-press capabilities, including $300,000 to increase the capacity and 
performance of an existing press. A portion of the net proceeds will be used 
for such purposes. 

Pending the use of proceeds for the foregoing purposes, the net proceeds will 
be invested in short-term, interest bearing obligations. 

The Company expects that the net proceeds of the Offering, together with 
internally generated funds and funds available under its revolving credit 
facility, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through fiscal year 
1998."

The uses of proceeds described above are estimates and approximations only and 
do not represent firm commitments by the Company. Of the net proceeds from the 
Offering, the Company intends to use approximately $2.8 million to expand its 
sales and marketing operations, fund greater levels of product development and 
purchase data processing and related hardware and software. 

Approximately $450,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay
the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the Company's Senior 
Secured Demand Promissory Notes (the ""NVC Notes"") held by NVC. It is anticipated
that at the date of this Prospectus, the aggregate outstanding principal balance
of the NVC Notes and accrued interest thereon will be approximately $700,000. 
The Company has and will use such funds to meet its working capital requirements
and the expenses incurred in connection with the Offering. The Company will 
issue the NVC Warrants to NVC in satisfaction of $250,000 of indebtedness 
evidenced by the NVC Notes. The remaining principal balance of the NVC Notes and
all accrued interest thereon will be repaid out of the net proceeds of the 
Offering. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of the NVC Notes as of 
December 31, 1996 was approximately $327,000. 

Approximately $170,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering will be used to pay 
the accumulated, undeclared dividends on the Preferred Stock which is held by 
DAH. Each share of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive an annual cash 
dividend of $55 from the date of the purchase in May 1995. 

The Company has agreed to pay the Underwriter out of the net proceeds of the 
Offering $100,000 in consideration for advisory and consulting services to be 
provided by the Underwriter for a two-year period. At the present time, no such 
transactions are contemplated. 

The remainder of the net proceeds of the Offering will be used for general 
corporate purposes and working capital. General corporate purposes includes the 
development and acquisition of data bases. Working capital includes funds to be 
used for general and administration expenses. In addition, any expenses incurred
by the Company to expand or relocate its facilities will be paid out of working 
capital. 

The Company believes that the estimated net proceeds to be received from the 
Offering, together with revenue from operations, will be sufficient to meet the 
Company's cash requirements for a period of at least 12 months following the 
date of this Prospectus, although there can be no assurance in this regard. 
Thereafter, if the Company has insufficient funds for its needs, it may need to 
seek additional funds from other sources. There can be no assurance that 
additional funds can be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all. If necessary 
funds are not available, the Company's business would be materially adversely 
affected. 

The foregoing represents the Company's best estimate of its expected use of the 
net proceeds of the Offering. The amounts actually expended for certain purposes
described above may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including,
but not limited to, the success of the Company's expansion strategy and changed 
circumstances and business opportunities, which may include the acquisition of 
other companies or their businesses. The Company's cash requirements may vary
because of delays in the development of future releases of its services, less 
than anticipated market acceptance of its services, competitive and
technological advances, regulatory changes, and increased competition. 
The Company reserves the right to reallocate the net proceeds among the 
foregoing uses. 

Pending the use of any net proceeds, the Company intends to invest the net 
proceeds from the Offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
securities. 

Any net proceeds from the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option or the Warrants,
will be added to working capital."

In the event the Underwriter exercises the Over-Allotment Option in full, the 
Company will receive an additional $1,044,000 of net proceeds, after deduction 
of underwriting discounts and the Underwriter's non-accountable expense 
allowance, and will utilize such additional proceeds for additional selling and 
marketing expenses and for general corporate purposes. 

The Bridge Notes bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum and mature on the 
earlier of: (i) the closing of a sale of securities or other financing of the 
Company from which the Company receives gross proceeds of at least $2,000,000 
or (ii) October 10, 1997, one year from the date of issuance. The proceeds of 
the Bridge Notes were used (i) to repay bank and other indebtedness to an 
affiliate in the aggregate amount of approximately $362,000; (ii) to pay fees 
and expenses of this Offering; and (iii) for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes. See ""The Company--Recent Bridge Financing."" 

Of the indebtedness owed to stockholders or their affiliates, (i) $50,000 owed 
to an affiliate bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum and is due upon 
consummation of this Offering; (ii) an aggregate of $482,715, owing to three 
stockholders, bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum and is due in April 
1997 or, if earlier, upon consummation of this Offering; and (iii) an aggregate
 of $38,678, owing to holders of the Company's pre-viously outstanding 
Convertible Preferred Stock, bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum and is 
due upon the satisfaction by the Company of certain financial conditions which 
will be satisfied upon consummation of this Offering. An additional $100,000 
borrowed from an unaffiliated investor bears interest at the rate of 12% per 
annum and is due in May 1997 or, if earlier, upon consummation of this Offering.
 The $100,000 loan from the Underwriter bears interest at the rate of 10% per 
annum and is due and payable in full on July 15, 1997 or, if earlier, upon 
consummation of this Offering. 
The Company anticipates that the proceeds from the Offering, together with 
projected cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to fund its operations 
for at least 12 months from the date of this Prospectus. Thereafter, the 
Company may need to raise additional funds. There can be no assurance that 
additional financing will be available or if available will be on favorable 
terms. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, the 
Company's ability to maintain its current level of operations will be 
materially and adversely affected. See ""Risk Factors--Additional Capital 
Requirements; Uncertainty of Additional Funding."" 


Pending application of the proceeds of the Offering, the Company intends to 
invest the net proceeds in certificates of deposit, money market accounts, 
United States government obligations or other short-term interest bearing 
obligations of investment grade. 

Proceeds of this Offering may also be used, if the Company so elects, to 
acquire companies or products that complement its business or operations. In 
the ordinary course of its business, the Company from time to time evaluates 
companies for acquisition and products for acquisition or license. The Company 
has no agreement or arrangement with respect to any such acquisition or license."

(1) Approximately $2,000,000 for repayment of certain indebtedness, consisting
    of $900,000 in principal amount of the Company's 10% Senior Secured Notes
    due June 30, 1999 (the ""Notes"") and $1,100,000 in principal amount of the
    Bridge Notes.
(2) Approximately $1,000,000 to increase staffing and purchase materials to fill
    backlog requirements during the next 12 months.
(3) Approximately $700,000 for the purchase of new capital equipment and making
    other improvements to the Company's manufacturing facilities, including
    approximately $300,000 which will be used to refurnish a currently inactive
    plant.
(4) Approximately $200,000 for sales and marketing activities, including hiring
    additional personnel for sales, purchasing multimedia laptop computers for
    sales presentations, updating and printing new sales literature, increasing
    the amount of advertisements, increasing the number of trade shows at which
    the Company can make presentations and other related sales expenses.
(5) Approximately $100,000 for refining the Company's POM manufacturing software
    (for the Company's own internal use as well as for marketing the product to
    others) by hiring additional engineering and marketing personnel.
(6) The balance, approximately $141,000 (plus any proceeds received from the
    exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment option), for working capital
    and other general corporate purposes (including approximately $75,000 for
    payment of certain real estate taxes due).


 

The amounts and timing of the above expenditures may vary and will depend on 
numerous factors, including, but not limited to, timing of orders from major 
customers and timing of expenditures in response to such orders. Management of 
the Company believes that the Company's existing and anticipated capital 
resources, including the estimated net proceeds of this Offering, will enable 
it to fund its planned operations for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of this Prospectus. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company 
will realize cash flow from operations or that such cash flow will be 
sufficient to satisfy the Company's requirements for any particular period of 
time. 

Pending the aforementioned uses, the net proceeds from this Offering will be 
invested in short-term, investment grade interest bearing obligations."

offered by the Company are approximately $21.6 million ($24.0 million if the 
Underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), based on an initial 
public offering price of $8.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds for exploration and development 
activities (including 3-D seismic and land acquisition and drilling for which 
the Company had budgeted approximately $27 million in 1997), repayment of all 
outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility ($13.25 million at 
May 5, 1997), and other general corporate purposes. While the Company believes 
that the net proceeds from the Offering, cash flow from operations and 
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility should allow the Company to 
finance its operations at least through 1998 based on current conditions, 
additional financing may be required in the future to fund the Company's 3-D 
seismic acquisition and drilling programs. The interest rate for borrowings 
under the Revolving Credit Facility is either the lender's base rate or LIBOR 
plus from 1.75% to 2.25% depending on the amount outstanding under the facility.
 At May 5, 1997 the current rate paid by the Company was 8.5%. 
See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Revolving Credit Facility"" for 
a description of the Revolving Credit Facility. Pending application of the net 
proceeds of the Offering as described above, they will be invested in short-
term, interest-bearing instruments. The Company will not receive any of the 
proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders, which will 
occur only if the Underwriters exercise their over-allotment option."

Company will realize additional net proceeds of approximately $897,000, which

     The Company anticipates that the proceeds, if any, received from any
exercise of the Warrants or the Underwriter's Warrants will be utilized for
working capital and other corporate purposes.
     The Company believes that the proceeds from the sale of the Units offered
hereby will enable the Company to satisfy its anticipated financing needs for a
period of at least 12 months following this offering. However, the capital
requirements relating to implementation of the Company's business plan will be
significant. Based on the Company's current assumptions relating to
implementation of its business plan (including the timetable of, and cost
associated with, store development), the Company will seek to develop, utilizing
the proceeds of this offering, existing cash, certain anticipated supplier
incentives, and cash flow from operations, if any, 7-11 stores during the 12
months following consummation of this offering. If the Company's plans change,
its assumptions prove to be inaccurate, or the capital resources available to
the Company otherwise prove to be insufficient to implement its business plan
(as a result of unanticipated expenses, problems or difficulties, or otherwise),
the Company would be required to seek additional financing or curtail its
activities. There can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient
capital resources to permit the Company to open the number or type of 2Connect
stores proposed in its business plan or to otherwise implement such plan."

allotment option is exercised. 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offerings to repay 
indebtedness. Approximately $85.0 million of such proceeds will be used to 
repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan and the 
Revolver, which bear interest at floating rates which were each approximately 
7.75% per annum (as of January 1, 1997). The Term Loan has a final maturity of 
December 31, 2002, and all borrowings under the Revolver must be repaid by 
December 31, 2003. Paydowns on the Revolver increase the availability thereof, 
subject to the requirement that all borrowings must be repaid by December 31, 
2003. In connection with the Offerings, the Credit Agreement will be amended 
and restated. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

HCB BANCSHARES INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/hcb-bancshares-inc-10033-8450,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/hcb-bancshares-inc-10033-8450,424B3,3/28/1997,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=208132,"The amount of proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock in the Conversion will 
depend upon the total number of shares actually sold, and the actual expenses 
of the Conversion. As a result, the actual net proceeds from the sale of the 
Common Stock cannot be determined until the Conversion is completed. Based on 
the sale of $20,000,000 of Common Stock (the midpoint of the estimated 
valuation range), the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock are 
estimated to be approximately $19,250,000. The Company expects to receive OTS 
approval to purchase all of the capital stock of the Bank to be issued in the 
Conversion in exchange for at least 50% of the net proceeds from sale of Common 
Stock under the Plan of Conversion. Based on the foregoing assumption, and the 
purchase of 8% of the shares to be issued in the Conversion by the ESOP, it is 
anticipated that the Bank would receive $9,625,000 in cash, a portion of which 
would replenish deposits withdrawn to purchase shares in the Conversion, and 
the Company would retain $8,025,000 in cash and $1,600,000 in the form of a 
note receivable from the ESOP. 

The cash proceeds retained by the Company initially will be invested in short-
term securities and will be available for a variety of corporate purposes, 
including additional capital contributions, loans to the Bank, future 
acquisitions and diversification of business, dividends to stockholders and 
future repurchases of the Common Stock to the extent not prohibited by the OTS.
For additional information, see ""Dividends"" and ""Business of the Bank."" 

The proceeds contributed to the Bank will ultimately become part of the Bank's
general corporate funds to be used for its business activities, which will 
include the origination of loans and possibly the repayment of a portion of the 
Bank's FHLB advances. Initially, it is expected that the proceeds will be 
invested in short-term securities. The availability of the proceeds to the Bank 
for the payment of dividends to the Company will be limited by regulatory 
restrictions on capital distributions by the Bank. Due to the limited nature of 
the Company's business activities, the Company believes that the offering 
proceeds retained after the Conversion will be adequate to meet the Company's 
financial needs until dividends are paid by the Bank; however, no assurance can 
be given that the Company will not have a need for additional funds in the 
future. For additional information, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Capital Resources and 
Liquidity,"" ""Business of the Bank,"" ""Regulation -- Regulation of the Bank -- 
Dividend Restrictions"" and ""Management of the Bank -- Certain Benefit Plans and 
Arrangements -- Management Recognition Plan."" 

Set forth below are the estimated net proceeds to the Company, assuming the 
sale of the Common Stock at the minimum, midpoint, maximum and 15% above the 
maximum of the estimated valuation range. The actual net proceeds from the sale 
of the Common Stock cannot be determined until the Conversion is completed. 
However, net proceeds set forth on the following table are based upon the 
following assumptions: (i) 100% of the shares of Common Stock will be sold in 
the Subscription Offering, as follows: (a) 8% will be sold to the ESOP, and 
112,500 shares will be sold to directors, executive officers and their 
associates (as defined in the Plan of Conversion), for which commissions will 
not be paid, and (b) the remaining shares will be sold to others in the 
Subscription Offering, for which estimated fees and expenses of $241,000 would 
be paid to Trident Securities; and (ii) other conversion expenses would be 
approximately $509,000. Actual expenses may vary from those estimated, because 
the fees paid will depend upon the total number of shares sold in the 
Subscription and Community Offerings and other factors.

offering to the repayment of indebtedness (including indebtedness to the 
Company's Chief Executive Officer), for general corporate purposes (principally 
additions to working capital and continued product development) and possible 
future acquisitions.

  and September 1997, with interest payable at maturity at
  the rate of 8% per annum (See ""Certain Transactions."")....   1,300,000


 

The balance of the net proceeds of approximately $3.3 million will be applied 
toward general corporate purposes (principally additions to working capital and 
continued product development) and, possibly, to acquire later-stage 
development or existing products from other companies or to acquire 
complementary businesses that have developed specific industry expertise or 
have existing relationships with large businesses needing Internet/Intranet 
solutions. Although the Company has not entered into any agreement or 
commitment and is not a party to any negotiations for any such acquisition, it 
has explored and plans to continue to evaluate opportunities to purchase, 
license or otherwise acquire the right to market products, services or 
businesses that complement the Company's business. 

The Company anticipates that it will utilize a portion of the net proceeds 
applied toward general corporate purposes to fund the following estimated 1997 
costs and expenditures:

The Company has not determined the exact amount it plans to expend on each of 
such uses or the timing of such expenditures. The amounts actually expended for
 each such use, if any, are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and may 
vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, including future revenue 
growth, the amount of cash generated by the Company's operations, the length of 
the sales cycle and the rapid changes in the Internet and Intranet marketplaces.

to range from $2.5 million to $3.5 million, or up to $4.1 million if the 
Estimated Valuation Range is increased by 15%. The Holding Company expects to 
receive conditional approval from the OTS to purchase all of the capital stock 
of the Savings Bank to be issued in the Stock Conversion in exchange for 90% of
the net investable proceeds of the Offerings. This would result in the Holding 
Company retaining (after funding the ESOP loan and the MRP) approximately 
$216,000 to $304,000 of net proceeds or up to $355,000 if the Estimated 
Valuation Range is increased by 15%, and the Savings Bank receiving the 
remainder. 

The net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will increase the Savings 
Bank's capital and could support the expansion of the Savings Bank's existing 
business activities. The Savings Bank will use the funds contributed to it for 
general corporate purposes, including initially the repayment of up to $1.0 
million of FHLB advances and investment in short-term securities of the type 
currently held by the Savings Bank. Subject to market conditions, the Savings 
Bank eventually intends to use the funds contributed to it to support its 
current core lending activities. The net proceeds retained by the Holding 
Company initially will be invested primarily in U.S. Government and agency 
securities and mortgage-backed securities of the type currently held by the 
Savings Bank. Such proceeds will be available for additional contributions to 
the Savings Bank in the form of debt or equity, to support future acquisition 
and diversification activities, as a source of any regular cash and/or periodic 
special cash dividends to the stockholders of the Holding Company and for any 
future repurchases of Common Stock. Currently, there are no specific plans, 
arrangements, agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding any of 
such activities. The Stock Conversion will also facilitate the Holding Company's
access to the capital markets. 

Upon completion of the Stock Conversion, the Holding Company's Board of 
Directors will have the authority to adopt stock repurchase plans, subject to 
statutory and regulatory requirements. Since the Holding Company has not yet 
issued stock, there is currently insufficient information upon which an 
intention to repurchase stock could be based. The facts and circumstances upon 
which the Board of Directors may determine to repurchase stock in the future may
include but are not limited to (i) market and economic factors such as the price
at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the 
attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return 
and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/
or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement 
in the Holding Company's return on equity; (ii) the avoidance of dilution to 
stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of 
stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and (iii) any other 
circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of the Holding
Company and its stockholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject to the 
determination of the Board of Directors that both the Holding Company and the 
Savings Bank will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory 
requirements after any such repurchases and that capital will be adequate taking
into account, among other things, the level of nonperforming and other risk 
assets, the Holding Company's and the Savings Bank's current and projected 
results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic environment 
and tax and other regulatory considerations."

the Company's unregistered Common Stock. The purchase price of The Natural Baby 
Catalog is subject to adjustment. See ""CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS- Acquisition of The 
Natural Baby Catalog."" 
(2) Includes the payment of $89,000 owed to all suppliers of merchandise 
purchased by the Company, which is overdue at March 31, 1997 based upon the

Company's parent, Duncan Hill, in the amount of $96,207, of which $66,858 
constitutes the repayment of principal and $29,349 constitutes accrued interest 
through June 30, 1997. See ""THE COMPANY AND ITS PARENT-The Reorganization."" 
Also includes the payment of notes payable incurred in connection with the 
Company's repurchase of 857,144 shares of Common Stock from certain private

(4) Estimated costs associated with the consolidation of the warehouse, 
telemarketing and data processing functions of The Natural Baby Catalog into

Natural Baby Catalog."" 
(5) The Company intends to use such funds, as well as the consolidation savings 
anticipated from the consolidation of the operations of The Natural Baby 
Catalog, for general working capital purposes. In that regard, the Company 
intends to replace its outdated data processing system hardware and upgrade its 
current software at an annualized cost of approximately $75,000 per year, on a 
leased basis. Lease payments will be made monthly and paid for from the Company'
s cash flow or working capital. The Company also anticipates spending no more 
than $10,000 to develop new statistical modeling software, which will be paid 
for by the Company's cash flow or working capital. The Company also intends to 
spend up to $150,000 per year to develop new customer acquisition and other 
marketing programs. See ""BUSINESS-Strategies."" In the event that the Company is 
unable to achieve the anticipated consolidation savings from the consolidation 
of the operation of The Natural Baby Catalog on a timely basis, the Company may 
need additional financing within twelve months from the date of the Prospectus. 
See ""RISK FACTORS-Possible Lack of Savings from the Integration and 
Consolidation of The Natural Baby Catalog Business; Adequacy of Financing."" 
There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional 
financing, if needed, on terms favorable to the Company or at all. 
The amounts set forth above are estimates. Should a reapportionment or
 redirection of funds be determined to be in the best interests of the Company, 
the actual amount expended to finance any category of expenses may be increased 
or decreased by the Company's Board of Directors, at its discretion. Although 
the Company does not intend to utilize any portion of the proceeds for payment 
of officers' salaries, it is possible that portions of working capital may be 
utilized for that purpose dependent upon revenues. 
To the extent that the Company's expenditures are less than projected, the 
resulting balances will be retained and used for general working capital 
purposes. Conversely, to the extent that such expenditures require the 
utilization of funds in excess of the amounts anticipated, additional financing 
may be sought from other sources, such as debt financing from financial 
institutions, although there can be no assurance that such additional financing,
 if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. See ""RISK FACTORS-
Dependence on Offering Proceeds to Pay Trade Creditors and to Acquire The 
Natural Baby Catalog Business."" The net proceeds of this Offering which are not 
expended immediately may be deposited in interest-bearing accounts or invested

full), after deduction of underwriting discounts and estimated expenses payable 
by the Company. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
shares of Common Stock offered hereby by the Selling Shareholders. 

The Company intends to use $34.2 million of the net proceeds of the Offering as 
follows: (i) approximately $15.2 million of the net proceeds from the Offering 
to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Company's bank credit facility, 
which matures in December 1999 and bears interest at the option of the Company 
at a floating rate of either (A) the base rate, defined as the higher of 
(x) 1/2 of 1% in excess of the Federal funds rate and (y) the prime rate plus 
2.5%, or (B) LIBOR plus 4.0%; (ii) approximately $2.7 million to prepay certain 
capitalized lease obligations, which have final payment dates ranging from June 
1998 to September 2000 and bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 8.86% to 
10.03%, with a weighted average rate of 9.28%; (iii) approximately $3.4 million 
to repurchase the Class B Interests; (iv) approximately $10.4 million to 
repurchase certain Class A Interests and certain non-convertible preferred 
limited partnership interests; and (v) approximately $2.5 million to pay the 
Fixed Return Amount. See ""The Reorganization."" Of such $34.2 million of net 
proceeds, $18.7 million will be paid to affiliates of the Company and entities 
controlled by such affiliates, including $14.2 million which will be paid to 
Banque Paribas and its affiliates and $3.3 million to William J. Mullis to 
repurchase his Class B Interests. The remainder will be used for general 
corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions of existing PEOs or other 
companies with related operations should favorable acquisition opportunities 
arise. The Company does not have any agreement, arrangement or understanding 
regarding such acquisitions or any money budgeted for such acquisitions. 

Pending such uses of the net proceeds, the Company intends to invest such funds 
in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade securities, certificates of 
deposit or obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States government."

Common Stock offered hereby at an initial public offering price of $8.25 per 
share are estimated to be approximately $17.0 million ($19.6 million if the
 over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting estimated underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds approximately as follows: (i) to 
repay $8.1 million of indebtedness, of which $3.4 million represents indebtedness 
to the Company's five principal stockholders and $1.6 million represents 
indebtedness to other related parties, as set forth in the table below; (ii) 
$5.8 million to acquire 144 acres of land for planned home development; (iii)
 $2.8 million to acquire the interests of various parties in certain properties 
in connection with the Reorganization and (iv) the balance, to fund the Company's
 development activities and for general corporate purposes, which may include 
the repayment of additional indebtedness and strategic acquisitions. The Company 
has no agreements, understandings or arrangements with respect to any such 
acquisition. 
Substantially all of the indebtedness to be repaid with a portion of the net 
proceeds of the Offering, other than the Subordinated Dividend Notes held by 
the principal stockholders (see Note 12 of Notes to Combined Financial Statements
 included elsewhere herein), matures in 1997 and represents loans for general
 corporate purposes, including land acquisition. At March 31, 1997, the weighted
 average annual interest rate was approximately 14.5% on such indebtedness other 
than indebtedness to the existing stockholders which bears no interest.

The Company expects to use approximately $6.5 million of the net proceeds for

remaining net proceeds of the offering for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes, including expansion of sales and marketing and research and 
product development efforts and financing of accounts receivable and 
inventories. The foregoing represent estimates only, and the actual amounts 
expended by the Company for these purposes and the timing of such expenditures 
will depend on numerous factors, including the status of the Company's product 
development efforts, the extent to which the Company's products gain market 
acceptance and the competition the Company and its products encounter in the 
marketplace. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the 
acquisition of technologies, businesses or products that are complementary to 
those of the Company, although no such acquisitions are planned or are being 
negotiated as of the date of this Prospectus, and no portion of the net

result in a permanent reduction of the principal amount of the term loan under 
the Credit Facility, it will not reduce the amounts available to the Company 
under either the revolving facility or the acquisition line of the Credit 
Facility. Pursuant to its growth strategy, the Company is actively considering 
acquisitions, although it currently does not have any understandings or 
agreements with respect to potential acquisitions. See ""Business -- Growth 
Strategy"". 

The Series A Preferred Stock accrues cumulative dividends at a rate of 13% per 
year. The Subordinated Notes bear interest at a rate of 13% per year and mature 
in July 2003. Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility bears interest 
at variable rates (8.72% per year at May 2, 1997) and matures in June 2003. See 
""Description of Certain Indebtedness"". Indebtedness under the Subordinated 
Notes and the term loan portion of the Credit Facility originally was incurred 
in connection with the acquisition of the Company by the TCW Funds or 
refinancing of such indebtedness. Indebtedness under the acquisition line of 
the Credit Facility was incurred in connection with the Company's recent 
acquisition of an injection molding facility."

In December 1996, the Company entered into the Revolving Credit Facility under 
which the borrowing base was $63.3 million as of March 31, 1997. At such date, 
borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility totalled $59.5 
million. The initial borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were used 
to finance a portion of the costs of the Acquisition. The Revolving Credit 
Facility is a three-year revolving credit facility with the entire outstanding 
principal amount maturing on December 31, 1999. In addition, the borrowing base 
under the Revolving Credit Facility may be redetermined by the Lenders at any 
time and is scheduled to be redetermined as of December 31, 1997. Following any 
such redetermination, the borrowing base may be reduced substantially from its 
then current level. All amounts outstanding in excess of such reduced borrowing 
base must be paid in full at such date. Absent a default or an event of default 
(as defined therein), outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit 
Facility accrue interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.50% per annum 
depending on the total amount drawn or, at the option of the Company, at the 
greater of (i) the prime rate and (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 
one-half of 1%, plus a margin of 0.50% to 1.50% depending on the total amount 
drawn. As of March 31, 1997, the weighted average interest rate applicable to 
outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was 8.05% per annum. 
For a description of the Revolving Credit Facility, including certain mandatory 
prepayment terms, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources -- 
Revolving Credit Facility."" 

IPF Company is a party to the IPF Company Credit Facility, which provides for a 
maximum $100.0 million revolving line of credit. Borrowings under this facility 
are used to finance IPF Company's investment activities under the IPF Program. 
The IPF Company Credit Facility matures June 1, 1999 at which time all amounts 
owed thereunder are due and payable. The borrowing base under the facility as 
of March 31, 1997 was $18.0 million and is subject to a scheduled 
redetermination by the lender every six months and such other redeterminations 
as the lender may elect to perform each year. Effective as of May 7, 1997, the 
borrowing base under the facility was increased to $23.0 million. As of March 
31, 1997, approximately $17.3 million was outstanding under the IPF Company 
Credit Facility and the weighted average interest rate applicable to such 
outstanding amount was 7.857% per annum. So long as no default or event of 
default (as defined therein) is outstanding, borrowings under the IPF Company 
Credit Facility accrue interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% or, at the 
option of IPF Company, the prime rate published in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. See

(1) The Company intends to purchase trailers in order to permit expansion of 
its operations. These trailers will generally consist of 53-foot long, high 
cubic capacity units. See ""Business -- Equipment and Technology."" 
(2) The Company plans in the next year to upgrade its computer hardware, 
software and communications technology in order to further streamline the 
Company's operations. See ""Business -- Equipment and Technology."" 
(3) Such purposes may include the payment of rent for the Company's executive 
offices (to an affiliate of the Company's Chief Executive Officer), general and 
administrative expenses, capital expenditures, payment of accounts payables and 
accrued expenses, marketing expenses, working capital in the form of accounts 
receivable as a result of the expansion of the Company's operations and 
satisfaction of certain corporate obligations. 

A portion of the net proceeds may be used for acquisitions. Although the 
Company is engaged from time to time in discussions relating to possible 
acquisitions, the Company presently has no agreements, understandings or 
commitments with respect to any acquisitions. The foregoing represents the 
Company's current estimate of its allocation of the net proceeds of this 
Offering based upon the current status of its business operations, its current 
plans, and current economic and industry conditions. Future events, as well as 
changes in economic or competitive conditions or the Company's business and the 
results of the Company's sales and marketing activities, may make different 
uses of funds necessary or desirable. 

If the Underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full, the Company 
will realize additional net proceeds of approximately $1,016,000, which will be 
added to the Company's working capital. 

The Company believes that the proceeds of this Offering, together with cash 
flow from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its contemplated cash 
requirements for at least 12 months following the consummation of this Offering. 
The Company's financial requirements will depend upon, among other things, the 
growth rate of the Company's business, the amount of cash flow generated by 
operations and the Company's ability to borrow funds or enter into lease or 
purchase financing arrangements for the acquisition of new vehicles or for 
working capital purposes. Should the Company require additional debt or equity 
financing to support its operations, there can be no assurance that such 
additional financing will be available to the Company on commercially 
reasonable terms, or at all. 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term 
interest-bearing investments. 

The Company anticipates that the proceeds, if any, received from any exercise 
of the Warrants or the Underwriters' Warrants (including the Warrants therein) 
will be utilized for working capital and other corporate purposes."

Stock offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately 
$29,951,600 (approximately $34,571,840 if the Underwriters' over-allotment 
option is exercised in full), net of estimated underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The 
principal purposes of the Offering are to obtain additional working capital, 
establish a public market for the Company's Common Stock, and facilitate future 
access to public markets. 

A portion of the net proceeds will be used to repay outstanding bank debt. As 
of March 31, 1997, the Company had outstanding borrowings of approximately $1.0 
million under a $2.0 million revolving credit facility used for working capital 
purposes, approximately $477,000 outstanding under a $1.0 million equipment 
financing facility and $57,875 under a promissory note. The Company's revolving 
credit facility and its equipment financing facility bear interest at the 
bank's prime lending rate (8.5% at March 31, 1997) plus 1/2% and 1%, 
respectively, and the promissory note bears interest at 8.75%. The Company's 
revolving credit facility expires on September 5, 1997, while amounts borrowed 
under the equipment financing facility are due in monthly installments 
beginning July 5, 1997 and continuing through June 5, 2000, the maturity date. 

The Company expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds of the Offering 
for general corporate purposes, including working capital. Up to approximately 
$1.7 million of the net proceeds may be used to pay certain royalty obligations 
payable by the Company to Merrill Lynch. See ""Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and Note 3 of Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements. A portion of the net proceeds may also be 
used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain 
the right to use complementary technologies. Although from time to time the 
Company evaluates potential acquisitions of such businesses, products or 
technologies, and anticipates continuing to make such evaluations, the Company 
has no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any 
acquisition of other businesses, products or technologies. Pending such uses, 
the proceeds will be invested in interest-bearing securities."

The Company expects to use its working capital to develop educational and 
pharmaceutical simulation software, to further enhance its products for the 
disability market, and to expand its distribution network and sales and 
marketing forces in the United States and internationally. The Company 
anticipates using approximately $2,605,000 of the net proceeds of the offering 
to add marketing, sales, engineering, and scientific personnel, to purchase 
equipment, to expand the size of its Palmdale, California, office and to 
continue to expand and enhance its lines of educational and pharmaceutical 
simulation software. The Company also expects to use approximately $1,800,000 of
the net proceeds of the offering to (i) repay a short-term bridge loan in the 
aggregate principal amount of $500,000, plus accrued interest at the rate of 
10.0% per annum and payment of additional fees, maturing five business days 
after the closing of this offering (See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis

The use of the balance of the net proceeds from the offering referenced as 
""Other Uses"" in the above table is dependent on various factors, including the 
timing of the introduction and customer acceptance of additional educational 
and pharmaceutical simulation software titles, and growth in foreign sales of 
the Company's disability products. The remaining proceeds of this offering, 
including any proceeds received from the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option 
(approximately $85,000, or approximately $835,000 if the Over-Allotment Option 
is exercised in full), will be used to fund additional new product development, 
potential strategic acquisitions or joint ventures, and other general corporate 
purposes including paying accrued interest to the holders of the notes issued in
connection with the Bridge Loan and the promissory notes held by Patricia Ann 
O'Neil and Fernando Zamudio, which as of April 30, 1997 was approximately 
$70,000. See ""Business -- Simulation Software -- Pharmaceutical Simulation 
Software."" Pending such uses, the net proceeds will be invested in short-term, 
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

Stockholders. 

The Company does not have a specific budget for the application of the net 
proceeds, which will be used for working capital, general corporate purposes 
and possible acquisitions of businesses, technologies or products complementary 
to the Company's business. A key element of the Company's growth strategy is to 
seek to acquire businesses, technologies or products involving one or more of 
the many ATE interface products related to its principal docking hardware and 
manipulator product lines. If the Company were to make any such acquisition, it 
might use a significant portion of the net proceeds or incur additional 
indebtedness in connection with such acquisition. A major purpose of this 
offering is to enable the Company to act upon acquisition opportunities by 
providing cash as well as a form of marketable security that can be used to 
fund one or more acquisitions. At the present time the Company is not engaged 
in any negotiations with third parties and has no specific agreements or plans 
with respect to such acquisitions, and there can be no assurance the Company 
will consummate any acquisition. See ""Risk Factors -- Broad Management 
Discretion as to Use of Proceeds"" and ""Business -- Strategy."" 

Although there can be no assurance, the Company believes it will have, 
exclusive of the net proceeds of the offering, cash and cash equivalents in 
excess of the amount necessary to pay a final S corporation distribution to the

sufficient cash and cash equivalents to pay such distribution, the Company may 
use a portion of the net proceeds to fund a portion of such distribution. If

development and expansion plans, including the development of its network, which
would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, 
results of operations and cash flow. See ""Risk Factors--Significant Capital 
Requirements."" 

The Company intends to use approximately $500,000 of the estimated net proceeds 
of the Offering to pay in full the outstanding balance of the CAPEX Term Note 
dated December 20, 1995 in the original principal amount of $500,000 as executed
and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Company's bank credit agreement 
with Marine Midland. The CAPEX Term Note bears interest at a rate equal to the 
prime rate plus .75% and is due on December 31, 1998 (subject to renewals). 

In the event the Underwriters exercise the over-allotment option granted to 
them by the Selling Shareholder, the Company will not receive any proceeds from 
the sale of shares of Common Stock by the Selling Shareholder."

approximately $226.0 million (approximately $269.5 million if the Underwriters' 
over-allotment options are exercised in full) after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the 
Company. The Company intends to use such proceeds as follows: (i) to repay 
approximately $24.0 million outstanding under the Subordinated Notes (as 
defined) held by Mr. Lauren and the GS Group; (ii) to pay the Dividend and the 
Reorganization Notes of approximately $43.0 million to Mr. Lauren and related 
entities and the GS Group; and (iii) to repay approximately $159.0 million of 
the borrowings outstanding under the Company's New Credit Facility. Any 
proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment 
options will be used to retire remaining borrowings outstanding under the 
Revolver and for general corporate purposes. 

At the time of the formation of Enterprises and Polo LP, each of the GS Group 
and Mr. Lauren made loans to Enterprises in the aggregate principal amount of 
$7.0 million and $17.0 million, respectively (the ""Subordinated Notes""). The 
Subordinated Notes bear interest at the prime rate, payable quarterly, and 
mature on March 1, 2001. The Reorganization Notes are non-interest bearing and 
are due on the earlier of (i) the date of completion of the Offerings and (ii) 
the sixtieth day following the declaration date of the Dividend. Borrowings 
under the New Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at a 
Base Rate (the ""Base Rate""), equal to the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate 
as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 1/2 of 1% and (ii) 
the prime commercial lending rate of Chase in effect from time to time or at 
the London Interbank Offered Rate plus an interest margin initially to be 0.3%. The New Credit Facility consists of a $375 million Revolver. Upon the closing of the Offerings the Company will be obligated to repay borrowings under the Revolver to reduce the indebtedness outstanding thereunder to $225.0 million. Indebtedness under the New Credit Facility was incurred to refinance the amounts outstanding under the Polo LP credit facility (approximately $111.8 million at the time of the Reorganization), to repay in full approximately $56.6 million in aggregate of the borrowings under the Womenswear LP credit facility and the PRC credit facility. Indebtedness under such facilities was incurred to fund, among other things, repayment of third party indebtedness and indebtedness owed to affiliates, distributions to partners, the PRC Acquisition and working capital requirements.

Stock offered hereby are estimated to be approximately $31.3 million ($36.1 
million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), at 
the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share and after deducting the 
underwriting discount and estimated expenses payable by the Company in 
connection with the offering. 

From the net proceeds of the offering, the Company will make the following 
payments to its principal shareholder: (i) repayment of the $12.9 million 
principal balance of the 1997 Notes, together with accrued interest thereon 
which the Company estimates will then be $250,000, (ii) repayment of the 1992 
Note, which the Company expects will then have a principal balance of $2.3 
million, (iii) the payment of undistributed S corporation earnings through 
March 31, 1997, of approximately $700,000, and (iv) a distribution of all 
undistributed accumulated S corporation earnings for the period from April 1, 
1997 through the effective date. The Company currently estimates that the 
undistributed accumulated earnings as of the effective date were between $1.0 
million and $3.0 million, although the actual amount of such earnings may vary 
significantly. The actual amount of this distribution will be reduced to the 
extent any prior distributions of 1997 accumulated earnings were made by the 
Company to its principal shareholder. 

The 1997 Notes and the 1992 Note were issued to reflect the distribution of 
accumulated earnings to the principal shareholder. The 1997 Notes bear interest 
at the minimum rate required to avoid imputation of interest using the 
applicable federal rate under the Code (currently 5.7%). Payment of the 1997 
Notes is due in full upon demand. The 1992 Note bears interest at a rate equal 
to the prime rate plus 1% per annum. Interest on the note is payable monthly, 
and principal is payable in 16 equal quarterly installments beginning July 1, 
1996. The 1992 Note contains an acceleration provision at the option of the 
noteholder upon certain designated changes in ownership, which was triggered by 
changes in the capital structure in February 1997. See ""Termination of S 
Corporation Status and Related Distributions"" and ""Certain Transactions."" 

The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for working capital and other 
general corporate purposes. Such purposes may include possible acquisitions of, 
or investments in, businesses and technologies that are complementary to those 
of the Company. The Company has no specific agreements, commitments or 
understandings with respect to any such acquisitions or investments. Pending 
application of the net proceeds as described above, the Company intends to 
invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing securities. See 
""Risk Factors -- Broad Management Discretion as to Use of Proceeds."" The

The indebtedness to be repaid to certain members and affiliates of the Investor 
Group consists of two separate loans. The first, which bears interest at the 
rate of 12.5%, matures on June 30, 1997, and was incurred in November 1996 for 
the purpose of redeeming all of the common and preferred stock of the Company 
owned by a former shareholder. The outstanding balance of such indebtedness was 
$6.6 million immediately prior to the Offering. The other indebtedness to be 
repaid to certain members and affiliates of the Investor Group bears interest 
at the prime rate (adjusted daily) and matures at September 1, 2001, and 
November 1, 2001, and has a current outstanding principal amount of $4.5 
million. The Working Capital Facility expires on November 22, 2001, unless 
extended, and bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. At February 28, 1997, this

 the Company will have borrowings of approximately $46.5 million under the

offering expenses and assuming no exercise of the Warrants. 

The Company expects to use up to $5 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering for the pre-clinical and the clinical trial phases of the Company's 
near term therapeutic programs. The Company expects to use approximately $5 
million to fund future research and development. The balance of the net 
proceeds of this offering will be used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. Where appropriate, proceeds of this offering also may be 
used to acquire products or technologies that complement the Company's 
business, although there are no present understandings, agreements or 
commitments with respect to any such acquisitions. The cost, timing and amount 
of funds required for such uses by the Company will be based on the timing of 
regulatory approvals, the results of clinical testing and trials, and the 
results of the Company's research and development programs. The amounts 
actually expended on any particular project may vary significantly from the 
Company's current plans, particularly given the Company's early stage of 
development and the uncertainty of the drug development process. If the 
Company's Rescission Offer closes prior to the closing of this offering, the 
Company intends that the cash requirements with respect to the Rescission Offer 
will be satisfied from existing cash and cash equivalents and, if required, 
from the proceeds of this offering. If shares with an aggregate rescission 
price greater than $1,500,000 are tendered to the Company and the Company is 
required to issue promissory notes, the Company's management retains broad 
discretion to use the remaining proceeds for payment of the note obligations. 
If this offering closes prior to the close of the Rescission Offer, no 
promissory notes will be issued and all eligible offerees who accept the 
Rescission Offer will be paid in cash and units of the Anti-Gene Development 
Group, as applicable. If all such offerees elect to rescind their purchases, 
the Company will be required to pay these holders $3,121,965 and 568.67 units 
of limited partnership interest in the Anti-Gene Development Group, plus 
approximately $2,129,000 in statutory interest.
