million (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us) or approximately $9.3 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds as follows:

• $0.5 million for our Phase I/II single arm, open label clinical trial;

• $1.0 million to fund the development of our Apotainer selection kit product;

• $2.1 million for our initial pivotal study;

• $1 million to advance the development of our Powered by Cellect technology 
  platform for additional indications and for general research activities; and

• The balance of $2.5 million for working capital and for general corporate  
  purposes including establishing an office in the United States.            

The amounts and schedule of our actual expenditures will depend on multiple
factors including the progress of our clinical development and regulatory
efforts, the status and results of the clinical trials, the pace of our
partnering efforts in regards to manufacturing and commercialization and the
overall regulatory environment. Therefore, our management will retain broad
discretion over the use of the proceeds from this offering. We may ultimately
use the proceeds for different purposes than what we currently intend. Pending
any ultimate use of any portion of the proceeds from this offering, if the
anticipated proceeds will not be sufficient to fund all the proposed purposes,
our management will determine the order of priority for using the proceeds, as
well as the amount and sources of other funds needed."

this offering will be approximately $8,600,000, assuming that all of the shares
offered hereby are sold, after deducting estimated selling agent commissions and
estimated offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from
this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales
and marketing activities, product development, general and administrative
matters, capital expenditures and acquisitions. In the event that any net
proceeds are not immediately applied, we may temporarily hold them as cash,

offering will be $83.9 million, or $91.6 million if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, based on the initial public
offering price of $18.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs, we will not
receive any proceeds from any sale of ADSs by the selling shareholder.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, to create a public market for our stock and thereby
enable access to the public equity markets for our employees and shareholders,
to obtain additional capital and to increase our visibility in the marketplace.
We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering
primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and
marketing activities, research and development activities, general and
administrative matters and capital expenditures, and to pay the entire
outstanding balance, accrued interest and prepayment fees under our credit
facility with Square 1. We also may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to make complementary acquisitions or investments. However, we do not
have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions or investments at
this time.

Our credit facility with Square 1 matures on May 29, 2017. We are required to
pay a prepayment fee of $267 thousand if certain events occur prior to the
maturity date, including if we or our co-borrowers complete an initial public
offering. Loans under the credit facility bear interest at Square 1's ""prime
rate"" plus 2.50%, but not less than 5.75% per annum, payable monthly in arrears.
As of March 31, 2016, we had drawn down $11.0 million under the credit facility,
and subsequent to March 31, 2016, we drew down an additional $1.0 million.
Borrowings under this credit facility have been used for general corporate
purposes. 

We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds of this
offering. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we
plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term
and long-term interest-bearing obligations, including government and
investment-grade debt securities and money market funds."

offering will be approximately $34.7 million, or approximately $40.3 million if
the underwriters exercise their option in full to purchase additional shares
from us, after the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily as follows:

• approximately $5.0 million to expand our sales and marketing activities;

• approximately $5.0 million to expand our product development activities;

• approximately $3.0 million to expand our reimbursement and clinical
  activities;

• approximately $8.2 million to pay the cumulative accrued dividends to our
  Series A preferred stockholders (assuming a closing date of August 1, 2016)

• the remainder for working capital, general and administrative expenses and
  other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary products, technologies or businesses, although we have no present
commitments to complete any such transaction. The amounts and timing of our
expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the rate of adoption of
our devices, the expenses we incur in sales and marketing our devices, the scope
of research and development efforts, the timing and success of any clinical
trials we may commence in the future, and the timing of regulatory submissions.

Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net
proceeds from this offering. Pending the uses described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade
securities, certificates of deposit or governmental securities."

• $0.6 to 2.8 million for psoriatic arthritis;

• $0.5 to 2.6 million for scleroderma; and

• $0.5 to 1.7 million for SLE;

• approximately $10.8 to 11.9 million through November 2017 to advance planned
  Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies of tesevatinib in NSCLC, glioblastoma,
  PKD and other studies;

• approximately $1.3 to 1.5 million through November 2017 to conduct various
  KD025 and tesevatinib toxicology studies, as well as other costs to develop
  various antibodies;

• approximately $1.8 to 2.0 million through November 2017 to fund CMCC to
  support clinical supply needs, process optimization and reformulation efforts,

• approximately $8.4 to 9.3 million through November 2017 to pay clinical
  infrastructure and in-house data management costs;

• $3.0 million to repay an outstanding interest-free demand loan provided by
  Dr. Harlan W. Waksal; and

• the remaining balance for working capital and other general corporate
  purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash,
cash equivalents, restricted cash and current revenue forecasts represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our development and commercialization 
efforts, the status of and results from clinical trials and actual results of
operations, as well as any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this 
offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or understandings for any
material acquisitions or licenses of any products, business or technologies.

As of March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 million and
restricted cash of $2.1 million. In June 2016, we raised an additional $5.5
million in gross proceeds, with no transaction costs, through the issuance of 
478,266 Class E redeemable convertible units. Based on our planned use of the
net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents and
current revenue forecasts, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
enable us to support research and development needs and to fund our operating
expenses and capital requirements for the next 16 months. We have based this
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not expect

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash,

intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our development and commercialization 
efforts, the status of and results from clinical trials and actual results of
operations, as well as any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this 
offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or understandings for any
material acquisitions or licenses of any products, business or technologies.

As of March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 million and
restricted cash of $2.1 million. In June 2016, we raised an additional $5.5
million in gross proceeds, with no transaction costs, through the issuance of 
478,266 Class E redeemable convertible units. Based on our planned use of the
net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents and
current revenue forecasts, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
enable us to support research and development needs and to fund our operating
expenses and capital requirements for the next 16 months. We have based this
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not expect

"AUDENTES THERAPEUTICS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/audentes-therapeutics-inc-953394-80103,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/audentes-therapeutics-inc-953394-80103,424B4,7/20/2016,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11497151,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our sale of 5,000,000 shares of our
common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of $15.00 per
share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses, will be approximately $66.1 million. If the underwriters’
option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, we estimate that we
will receive additional net proceeds of $10.5 million.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following
purposes:

• approximately $18.0 to $20.0 million to advance AT132 for the treatment of
  XLMTM through preliminary results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial expected in
  the fourth quarter of 2017;                                 

• approximately $13.0 to $15.0 million to advance AT342 for the treatment of
  Crigler-Najjar through preliminary results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial
  expected in the fourth quarter of 2017;                           

• approximately $3.0 to $5.0 million to advance preclinical development of AT982
  for the treatment of Pompe disease through preliminary results from a Phase
  1/2 clinical trial expected in the second half of 2017;    

• approximately $3.0 to $5.0 million to advance preclinical development of AT307
  for the treatment of CASQ2-CPVT through submission of an IND or CTA in 2017;

• approximately $7.0 to $10.0 million to operate and expand our internal  
  manufacturing facility; and                                             

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which
  will include funding for the hiring of additional personnel, capital
  expenditures and the costs of operating as a public company.    

We estimate that our current cash, cash equivalents and investments, along with
the net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient for us to fund our
operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2018.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with any certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses
set forth above. We may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition
of, or investment in, technologies, intellectual property or businesses that
complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements
to this effect.

The amounts and timing of our future expenditures and the extent of product
candidate development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the status, results and timing of our current preclinical studies and
clinical trials we may commence in the future, product approval process with the
FDA and other regulatory agencies, our current collaborations and any new
collaborations we may enter into with third parties and any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

The expected net proceeds of this offering will not be sufficient for us to fund
any of our product candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need to
raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and
commercialization of our product candidates.

Pending their use as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from
this offering in marketable securities that may include investment-grade
interest-bearing securities, money market accounts, certificates of deposit,
commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $375,000,000 (or $402,500,000
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full) as well as
    amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in
    connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    the date of this prospectus, we had borrowed $225,000 under the promissory
    note with our sponsor. These amounts will be repaid upon completion of this
    offering out of the offering proceeds that has been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and
    amounts not to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the
    offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such
    excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $13,125,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or $14,087,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only, and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. We
    are also entitled to up to $1,000,000 in interest from the trust account to
    be used for working capital purposes. The amount of interest available to us
    from the trust account may be less than $1,000,000 as a result of the
    current interest rate environment.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $375,000,000 (or $402,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $13,125,000 (or $14,087,500 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $75,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year.
Except with respect to up to $1,000,000 of interest earned on the funds held in
the trust account that may be released to us to fund working capital
requirements, as well as amounts released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest
rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of
income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of the
date of this prospectus, we had borrowed $225,000 under the promissory note with
our sponsor. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of December 31, 2016 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the offering proceeds not held
in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

us in Japanese yen, including for the portion of shares that will be represented
by ADSs. If Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representative of the international
underwriters, and Nomura Securities Co., Ltd., as representative of the Japanese
underwriters, exercise in full their options, in the aggregate, to purchase up
to an additional 5,250,000 shares, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds
of approximately ¥125,753,000,000 after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses that remain payable by
us.

The primary purposes of the global offering are financing our business
expansion, which may include investment, acquisition or strategic cooperation to
expand our user base or procure additional content for the LINE platform,
marketing new products and services and for other general corporate purposes. In
addition, we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
repay ¥42,000 million in loans, all due between July and September 2016, with
interest rates between 0.07% and 0.18%, including ¥5,000 million in short-term
borrowings we obtained in August 2015 primarily for income tax payments.

We have no agreements or commitments for particular uses of the net proceeds
from this global offering, and our management may exercise discretion over the
terms and timing of any future transaction in light of the changing needs of our
business. In the meantime, we intend to hold any net proceeds in cash or invest
them in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

stock and warrants of approximately $6.9 million, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of common stock and warrants
of is exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds of
approximately $8.2 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering for
repayment of indebtedness and for working capital, which will primarily consist
of the funding of inventory, the hiring of additional marketing, the payment of
$375,000 owed to Monster, Inc. further to the Monster License Agreement and
sales personnel and for other general corporate purposes, which includes the
cost of operating as a public company and the cost of potentially acquiring or
licensing other products, businesses or technologies, although we have no
present commitments for any such acquisitions or licenses. The $462,000 in
indebtedness to be repaid with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering
consists of $336,000 lent to our company in the form of Bridge Notes plus a
22.5% origination fee of $75,600 plus an interest payment of $50,400
representing a fixed 15% of principal loaned. The Bridge Notes, issued between
October 2015 and March 2016, had a maturity date of the earlier of one year from
the date of issuance or the effective date of our initial public offering. The
net proceeds from these Bridge Notes were used for working capital and the
funding of inventory.

This expected use of our net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on
numerous factors, including any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
of this offering.

Pending our use of our net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and US government
securities."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of a loan from M III LLC of up to $250,000 that we may draw down as
    described in this prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon completion of   
    this offering out of the $600,000 of offering proceeds that has been        
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting      
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in 
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital  
    expenses.                                                                   

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 4.0%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. If the underwriters’ over-allotment 
    option is exercised, 6.0% of the gross proceeds from the over-allotment will
    be deposited in the trust account as deferred underwriting commissions. Upon
    completion of our initial business combination, up to $6,000,000, which     
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $7,350,000 if  
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid  
    to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the       
    remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a      
    portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our  
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes,      
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in      
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be 
    entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.              

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account to pay our taxes. Based on the current interest rate environment, we
    would expect approximately $30,000 per year to be available to us from      
    interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over 24 months       
    following the closing of this offering; however, we can provide no          
    assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 
    0.02% per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust  
    account may be invested.                                                    

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement units, $150,000,000 (or $172,500,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to $6,000,000 (or up
to $7,350,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $30,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year. We
will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the
trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or working
capital expenses, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we
are unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing
of this offering (subject to the requirements of law). Based on current interest
rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be
sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of working capital expenses.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

M III LLC has loaned or agreed to loan us up to $250,000 to be used for a
portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing,
unsecured and is due at the earlier of July 31, 2016 or the closing of this
offering. This loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the
$600,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering
expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans will be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. No written agreements
exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less
than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules)
and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us (and
Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed as part of its unit purchase agreement), pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares, private placement shares and (except for Cantor Fitzgerald)
public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business
combination. In addition, our initial stockholders and Cantor Fitzgerald have
agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account
with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if we fail to
complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if
our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of loans from certain of our sponsors of up to $250,000 in the
    aggregate that we may draw down as described in this prospectus. These loans
    will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $725,000 of
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering
    expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to2.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $1,625,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $1,868,750 if the underwriters’ 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, such amount to be reduced pro rata
    based on the number of shares of common stock that are redeemed by our
    shareholders in connection with our business combination, and the remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) Of the proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the private
    placement warrants described in this prospectus, $66.3 million or 
    approximately $76.25 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full ($10.20 per unit), will initially be deposited into a
    trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as 
    trustee.  We will have until 12 months from the closing of this offering to
    consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that
    we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12
    months, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business
    combination up to three times, each by an additional three months (for a 
    total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination). In order to
    extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business
    combination, our sponsors or their affiliates or designees must deposit into
    the trust account $379,167, or $436,042 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full ($0.058 per unit in either case), up to an 
    aggregate of $1,137,501 (or $1,308,126 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full), or $0.175 per unit, prior to the applicable
    deadline for each three month extension.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect
    approximately $348,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the 
    funds held in the trust account over 21 months following the closing of this
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This 
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.3% per annum based upon current
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $66,300,000 (or approximately $76,245,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$1,625,000 (or up to $1,868,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will initially be
placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, subject to increase in the event that our sponsors elect to extend
the period of time to consummate a business combination, and will be invested
only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $198,900 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.3% per year. We
will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the
trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or working
capital expenses (which may include repayment of loans made to us by the
sponsors or the application of withdrawn or accrued interest to the sponsors’
obligation to loan us money in connection with an extension), until the earlier
of (i) the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the redemption
of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination
within 12 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months from the
closing of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a
business combination, as described in more detail in this prospectus) (subject
to the requirements of law). Depending on interest rates, interest earned on the
trust account may not be sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of
working capital expenses.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our executive officers a total of $10,000 per month for
office space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, certain of our sponsors have agreed to loan
us up to $250,000 in the aggregate to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at
the earlier of December 31, 2016 or the closing of this offering. These loans
will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $725,000 of offering
proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account including interest permitted to be withdrawn as
described herein. In the event that our initial business combination does not
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
account including interest permitted to be withdrawn as described herein to
repay such loaned amounts but no other proceeds from our trust account would be
used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans (including any
loans made in connection with the extension of the time available for us to
consummate our initial business combination) may be convertible into warrants of
the post-business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the
option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement
warrants. All other terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any,
have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such
loans.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our business
combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and
the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition
that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public
shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net
tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not
proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of this 
offering (or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the
period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail
in this prospectus), following the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations (including
but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed
business combination or (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection
with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated
articles of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an
initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering
(or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of
time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this
prospectus), from the closing of our initial public offering. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

we are offering will be approximately $9.8 million (or $11.5 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option to purchase additional shares
in full), based on the initial public offering price of $8.00 per share, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend
to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for working capital and
general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, product
development and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net
proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or
businesses. However, we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into
any acquisitions or investments. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net
proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing
securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial
paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditure, including expenditure related
to sales and marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors,
including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing
activities, expansion internationally, the amount of cash generated or used by
our operations, competitive pressures and other factors described under “Risk
Factors” in this prospectus. We therefore cannot estimate the amount of net
proceeds to be used for the purposes described above. As a result, we may find
it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes. Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds,
and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the
net proceeds from this offering."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $148.1 million, after
deducting $12.9 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
expenses payable by us in connection with this offering. The underwriters may
also purchase up to a maximum of 1,050,000 additional shares of common stock
from us pursuant to their option to purchase additional shares. We estimate that
the net proceeds to us, if the underwriters exercise their right to purchase the
maximum of 1,050,000 additional shares of common stock from us, will be
approximately $170.8 million, after deducting underwriting estimated discounts
and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us in connection with this
offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to repay $148.1 million in
aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured
Term Loan Facility.

The Senior Secured Term Loan Facility had $364.0 million outstanding (net of an
unamortized discount of $1.8 million and unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.2
million) as of June 30, 2016 with a maturity date of April 1, 2021. Borrowings
under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at
our option, either (a) a Eurocurrency rate based on LIBOR for U.S. dollar
deposits for loans denominated in dollars, EURIBOR for Euro deposits for loans
denominated in Euros and the offer rate for any other currencies for loans
denominated in such other currencies for the relevant interest period, plus
4.00% per annum if our total net leverage ratio is greater than 4.75:1.00, or
3.75% if our total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.75:1:00;
provided that the relevant Eurocurrency rate shall be deemed to be no less than
1.00% per annum; or (b) a base rate, which is defined as the highest of (i) the
Federal Funds Rate on such day plus  1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the Prime Lending Rate
on such day, (iii) the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for Loans denominated in U.S.
dollars published on such day for an Interest Period of one month plus 1.00% and
(iv) 2.00%, plus 3.00% per annum if our total net leverage ratio is greater than
4.75:1.00, or 2.75% if our total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to
4.75:1:00; provided that the base rate shall be deemed to be no less than
2.00% per annum. We may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Senior
Secured Term Loan Facility without premium or penalty. As of June 30, 2016, the
interest applicable on the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility was the
Eurocurrency minimum floor interest rate of 4.75%.

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares from us
in full, we estimate that we will receive additional net proceeds of
$22.6 million, which we intend to use to repay additional borrowings outstanding
under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility."

deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $35.0 million to fund continued development of PTG-100 through
  the completion of a Phase 2b clinical trial;                       

• approximately $11.0 million to advance PTG-200 to complete a Phase 1 clinical
  trial;                                                            

• approximately $8.0 million to complete IND-enabling studies and to begin a 
  Phase 1 clinical trial for PTG-300;                                        

• approximately $5.0 million to fund our research and discovery activities
  related to additional product candidates; and

We believe, based on our current operating plan and expected expenditures that
the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents, and
available-for-sale securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at
least the next 18 months.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the results of our research and development effort, the
timing and success of our ongoing pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and
pre-clinical studies and clinical trials we may begin in the future, the timing
of our regulatory submissions, the factors described under “Risk Factors” in
this prospectus, and the amount of cash used in our operations. We therefore
cannot predict with certainty the amount of net proceeds from this offering to
be used for the purposes described above.

In addition, in the event we identify other opportunities that we believe are in
the best interests of our stockholders, we may also use a portion of the net
proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary businesses,
medicines, technologies or products, although we have no current commitments or
obligations to do so. The costs and timing of the expansion of our sales and
marketing capabilities and the conduct of our research and development
activities are highly uncertain, subject to substantial risks and can often
change. Depending on the outcome of these activities, our plans and priorities
may change, and we may apply the net proceeds from this offering differently
than we currently anticipate. As a result, we will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds.

Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."

offered hereby and estimated offering expenses of $685,000, the net proceeds of
this offering will be approximately $21,323,000. We intend to apply the
estimated net proceeds of the offering as follows:

         Total Net Proceeds                          $ 21,323,000      100 %

We intend to apply approximately $13.8 million of the net proceeds of this
offering towards development engineering, which will consist primarily of our
further development and qualification of MST® and the evaluation, testing and
engineering involved in the formal product qualification process undertaken by
our potential customers. As our marketing and business development efforts lead
to a significant indication of interest on the part of a potential customer, we
will engage in development engineering for purposes of characterizing our
solution to the goals and needs of the customer, and work with customer to tune
our MST® to their unique production process and equipment.

We intend to apply approximately $3.3 million of the net proceeds of this
offering towards business development, marketing and sales. In the initial
stages of our marketing and business development, we expect to spend a
significant amount of time and capital in defining the benefits of MST® for each
target customer, including simulation, modeling, data collection, marketing
costs, market research, partnership development, and business development
efforts.

We intend to apply approximately $1.5 million of the net proceeds of this
offering towards research spending, including long-term investigation into
additional advanced materials and techniques for our platform, efforts with our
academic and scientific partners, and maintenance of our patent portfolio.

The net proceeds allocated towards working capital will be applied towards our
costs of facilities, information technology, public company related costs,
including accounting and legal, along with normal recurring general and
administrative expenses.

Our estimated use of proceeds is based on our current assumptions and estimates
concerning the costs and timelines of securing one or more IDMs or fabless
semiconductor manufacturers to qualify and license MST®technology and start
full-scale industrial production of a device that incorporates our MST®
technology. If our assumptions or estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may
require additional funds in order to carry out the activities described above.
In addition, the expected allocation of net proceeds set forth above represents
our best estimates based upon our present plans and our assumptions regarding
industry conditions and our anticipated future revenues and expenditures. We may
find it necessary to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-described
categories or to use portions thereof for other purposes in order to carry out
our business plan if those assumptions change.

If the underwriter exercises its right to purchase additional 480,000 shares of
common stock to cover over-allotments, we may receive up to an additional
$3,301,200, after deducting $298,800 for underwriting discounts. We intend to
apply any net proceeds from the exercise of the overallotment option to working
capital. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds
from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities
such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."
GEMPHIRE THERAPEUTICS INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/gemphire-therapeutics-inc-962326-80736,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/gemphire-therapeutics-inc-962326-80736,424B4,8/8/2016,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11530532,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $25.6 million (or
approximately $29.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock
offered by us in this offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to make significant investments in
research and development and clinical activities related to gemcabene and for
working capital and other general corporate purposes as well as to establish a
public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the
public equity markets.

We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this offering, together with
our cash and cash equivalents, for the following purposes:

. approximately $20.0 million to fund development costs associated with our
  three late stage clinical trials of gemcabene for our target indications and
  for costs associated with our planned End of Phase 2 (EOP2) meetings with the
  FDA;

. approximately $4.0 million to fund manufacturing-related activities for 
  gemcabene;

. approximately $3.5 million to fund development costs associated with
  preclinical studies and related activities for gemcabene; and

. the balance for general corporate purposes, including working capital, general
  administrative costs, potential acquisition or in-licensing costs and the
  prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual property.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to advance the
development of any acquired or in-licensed product candidate. However, we have
no current commitments or obligations to acquire or in-license any product
candidate.

We expect to have our EOP2 meetings with the FDA in the first half of 2018.
Based upon our currently anticipated clinical trials, we will need to raise
additional capital to continue to fund the further development of gemcabene and
our other operations. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors, including our ability to gain access to additional
financing and the relative success and cost of our research, preclinical and
clinical development programs. We have based this estimate on assumptions that
may prove to be wrong, however, and we could use our cash resources sooner than
we expect. Additionally, the process of advancing early-stage product candidates
and testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of
progress in these clinical trials is uncertain.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to access additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs,
whether we are able to enter into future licensing arrangements and the other
factors described under ""Risk Factors"" in this prospectus. In addition, we might
decide to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or preclinical activities if
the net proceeds from this offering and any other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government, or hold them as cash."

be approximately $115.8 million (or $134.0 million if the underwriters' option 
to purchase additional shares is exercised in full), after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay
approximately $115.8 million of principal amount of indebtedness under the
Second Lien Facility. To the extent that the underwriters do not exercise their
option to purchase additional shares, we intend to use borrowings under the ABL
Facility to repay the remaining principal amount of the Second Lien Facility. We
expect to use cash to pay any accrued and unpaid interest and premium on the
outstanding principal amount of the Second Lien Facility. To the extent any
proceeds from this offering remain after the repayment in full of our Second
Lien Facility, including any accrued and unpaid interest and premium thereon, we
intend to use such remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes.

The total amount required to repay the Second Lien Facility in full is
approximately $130.1 million, including premium, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any. Interest accrues on the Second Lien Facility at an annual rate
of 9.0%, or approximately $250 per day for each $1.0 million of principal
amount. Interest is payable on the last business day of January, April, July and
October in each year, and was last paid on July 29, 2016. Borrowings under the

follows:

• to fully repay ABC Funding, LLC, an affiliate of Summit Partners, L.P., or 
  ABC Funding, under our July 1, 2016 term loan credit facility, or the ABC 
  Credit Facility, which had an outstanding balance of $30.0 million as of July
  1, 2016 and a prepayment fee of $3.9 million as of the completion of this 
  offering;

• fully repay Dr. John Durham and Mrs. Joanne Durham under our $250,000 demand
  promissory note bearing interest at 6% per annum, which had an outstanding 
  balance of $250,000 as of June 30, 2016;

• to pay $5.0 million, which represents the remaining portion of the cash 
  purchase price for the acquisition, completed in September 2016, of primarily
  intellectual property and software assets, which were previously licensed by
  us, that are integrated in the MRM Matrix;

• to continue to develop new product offerings;

• to enter into new market segments with our existing solutions;

• to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure;

• to fund additional acquisitions of businesses and technologies; and

• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

In July 2016, we entered into the ABC Credit Facility with ABC Funding pursuant
to which we can request up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million in term loan
advances. The proceeds of the initial term loan advance of $30.0 million under
the ABC Credit Facility, together with available cash, were used to repay all
outstanding amounts under the Medliance Notes, the December 2014 Eastward Loan
and the April 2014 Eastward Loan. Any future term loan advances under the ABC
Credit Facility will be used to buy back outstanding warrants and fund future
acquisitions, if any. Amounts outstanding under the ABC Credit Facility bear
interest at a per annum rate equal to 12.0% payable monthly in arrears. The ABC
Credit Facility has a maturity date of December 30, 2021, and is secured by a 
subordinated security interest in all of our personal property, whether
presently existing or created or acquired in the future, as well as our
intellectual property. Any amounts outstanding under the ABC Credit Facility
that are repaid may not be reborrowed.

ordered the specific uses of proceeds in order of priority. We expect to devote
any funds raised over the minimum offering amount to our high-pressure steam
explosion degumming process project. Thus, if we sell the maximum number of
shares offered in this offering, we expect that an additional $1.84 million
would be devoted to the high-pressure steam explosion degumming process project
and would decrease any planned debt financing for such project. Regardless of
whether we raise the minimum or maximum offering amount, the Company may require
bank debt to finance procurement of the land-use rights needed for such project.
Based on the management estimation, the land value could support a bank loan of
approximately RMB 30 million, or approximately $4.9 million.

receive from the sale of our common stock in this offering will be approximately
$625.0 million (or approximately $719.0 million if the underwriters’

of our expenses in connection with this offering. Immediately prior to the
closing of this offering, we expect to borrow approximately $875.0 million under
our senior secured term loan facility and approximately $125.0 million under our
senior secured revolving credit facility and transfer the proceeds to Ashland.
We expect to use the proceeds of this offering, net of underwriting discounts,
to reduce our obligations under our senior secured term loan facility and our
senior secured revolving credit facility so that, after giving effect to the
application of the net proceeds of this offering, there is no more than
approximately $375.0 million outstanding under the secured term loan facility
and no borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit
facility. We would retain and expect to use for general corporate purposes any
additional proceeds to us from the exercise by the underwriters of their
overallotment option.

Ashland has informed us that it currently expects to use any amounts from
borrowings by us prior to the closing of this offering that are transferred to
Ashland to repay borrowings under the Ashland Credit Facilities. Ashland has
informed us that as of June 30, 2016, approximately $500 million and $1.05
billion of borrowings were outstanding under the Ashland Revolver and the
Ashland Term Loan, respectively. Ashland has not made a final determination as
to which facilities it will repay and it may elect to repay other facilities or
different amounts of these facilities. Certain of the underwriters or their

approximately US$76.0 million, or approximately US$88.2 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public
market for our Class B ordinary shares. We intend to use the net proceeds of
this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
including investments in technology and infrastructure, product development and
expansion of sales and marketing efforts. Additionally, we may use a portion of
the net proceeds to invest in or acquire complementary businesses, products,
services or technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for
any material acquisitions as of the date of this prospectus. We cannot specify
with certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive from
this offering. The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending on
the amount of cash generated by our operations and the rate of growth, if any,
of our business.

The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and allocate the net
proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business conditions.
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand 
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiary only through loans or 
capital contributions, and to our VIE and its subsidiaries only through loans.
Subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval
requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our PRC subsidiary or make
additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to fund its capital
expenditures or working capital. We currently do not have any plans to use any
of the proceeds from this offering as loans or capital contributions to our PRC
subsidiary or to our VIE. However, if we need to utilize the proceeds of this
offering to fund our PRC operations, we cannot assure you that we will be able
to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at
all."

in this offering will be approximately $57.8 million, after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. In 
addition, we received gross proceeds of CHF 14 million in July 2016 from
Genentech related to our collaboration on the anti-tau antibody program.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. At June 30, 2016, after taking into consideration
the CHF 14 million milestone payment from Genentech related to the anti-tau
antibody program, we would have had cash and cash equivalents of 
CHF 96.4 million. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering over the
next three years together with our existing cash and cash equivalents as
follows: 

• approximately $5.0 million to fund our share of the costs for the further 
  development of our therapeutic product candidates (other than ACI-35) and 
  diagnostics product candidates under collaboration agreements (anti-tau 
  antibodies and the tau PET tracers), excluding our collaboration agreement 
  with Biogen, over the next three years, of which approximately $4.0 million
  will be spent on therapeutic product candidates and of which approximately
  $1.0 million will be spent on diagnostic product candidates, and we expect 
  these expenditures will take the tau PET tracers into Phase 2 and the 
  anti-tau antibody program into Phase 2; 

• approximately $10.0 million to fund our share of the costs for the further
  development of ACI-35, our tau vaccine under collaboration with Janssen, and
  we expect these expenditures will take ACI-35 into Phase 2; 

• approximately $65.0 million for the further development of ACI-24 for AD
  through the remainder of the Phase 1/2a study and the Phase 2b study and for
  our ongoing Phase 1 study and a portion of the proposed Phase 2 study of 
  ACI-24 for Down syndrome; 

• approximately $25.0 million for funding our PD-focused programs, including
  further pre-clinical development, the completion of Phase 1 studies and 
  commencement of Phase 2 studies for our alpha-synuclein diagnostic product
  candidate as well as further pre-clinical development and the commencement of
  a Phase 1 clinical study of Morphomer alpha-synuclein, our alpha-synuclein 
  morphomer product candidate; 

• approximately $20.0 million for the further development of non-AD and non-PD
  programs, including our morphomer tau and glaucoma program for which we intend
  to commence a Phase 1 study; 

• approximately $10.0 million for new research and development initiatives that
  are complementary to our existing and planned research initiatives (with the
  intent to advance these new initiatives through the discovery phase); and
                                                  
• the remainder for general corporate purposes.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process,
it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds
from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. The amount and
timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including
the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and success of
our ongoing preclinical and clinical studies or preclinical and clinical studies
we may commence in the future and the timing of regulatory submissions. As a
result, our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net
proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds. In addition, we might decide to
postpone or not pursue certain preclinical activities or clinical studies if the
net proceeds from this offering and our other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. and Swiss governments.
We are likely to convert a substantial amount of the proceeds into CHF shortly
after the closing of this offering."

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
Class A common stock, facilitate our future access to the public capital markets
and improve brand awareness, as well as to obtain additional capital. We intend
to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to repay $20.2 million
principal and prepayment fees for amounts borrowed under our credit facilities,
and the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes. Other than
the repayment of indebtedness we have not quantified or allocated any specific
portion of the net proceeds or range of net proceeds to any particular purpose.
Additionally, we may choose to expand our current business through acquisitions
of, or investments in, other complementary businesses, technologies, or other
assets. However, we currently have no agreements or commitments with respect to
any such acquisitions or investments.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds
to be received upon the closing of this offering. In addition, the amount,
allocation and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors. Pending other uses, we intend to invest the proceeds in
interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or
direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government, or hold as cash. We
cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return. Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we
receive from our initial public offering, and investors will be relying on the
judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds.

facility to be repaid from the net proceeds of this offering accrues interest at
a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 1.25% and is scheduled to mature on

subordinated loan and security agreement to be repaid from the net proceeds of
this offering accrues interest at 9.5% and is scheduled to mature on April 20,
2019. We used the proceeds of such borrowings for working capital. In addition,
we intend to pay a prepayment penalty and a final payment fee in the aggregate
amount of $200,000 from the net proceeds of this offering incurred in connection
with the foregoing repayment under our subordinated loan and security agreement."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor loaned us $250,000 to be
    used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans will be
    repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $850,000 of offering
    proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other
    than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less
    than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing
    working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $8,225,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $8,750,000 if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject
    to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with
    legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately
    $47,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the
    trust account over the 12 months following the closing of this offering;
    however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate
    assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current yields of
    securities in which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order
    to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
    combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be
    required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the
    trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not
    close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
    account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account
    would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of such loans
    may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at 
    a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
    be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The
    terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain
    of our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no 
    written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to
    seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
    or certain of our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third
    parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any
    and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $235,000,000 (or $250,000,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $8,225,000 (or up to
$8,750,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $47,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.02% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if
any, we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held
in the trust account and these funds will not be released from the trust account
until the earliest of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination;
(ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem 100%
of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering; and (iii) the redemption of
all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest earned
on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. However, if our estimate of
the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
our sponsor, members of our management team or any of their affiliates, but such
persons are not under any obligation to loan funds to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor loaned us $250,000 to be used
for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest
bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2016 or the
closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the $850,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the
payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account
released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held
outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the
trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of such
loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity
at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor, including
as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such
loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and
directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with
respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than
our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and
directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan
such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to
funds in our trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their affiliates may purchase public shares in privately negotiated
transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business
combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to
engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for
any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make
any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public
information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by
Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such
purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer
rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the
going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine
at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules,
the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business
combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth
or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their
redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement
or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption
of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering; and (iii) the
redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. Our other directors and officers have entered into
letter agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial shareholders
with respect to public shares acquired by them (if any) following this offering.
In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our initial shareholders or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

of 12,500,000 common units offered by this prospectus, based on the initial
public offering price of $22.50 per common unit, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions, the structuring fee and estimated offering expenses.
Our estimate assumes the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common
units is not exercised. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering
(i) to make a distribution of approximately $257.4 million to Noble, and (ii) to
pay approximately $2.3 million of origination fees and expenses related to our
new revolving credit facility.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the
remainder of the 1,875,000 additional common units, if any, will be issued to
Noble at the expiration of the option period. Any such common units issued to
Noble will be issued for no additional consideration. If the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units, we expect to
receive net proceeds of approximately $39.5 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions, the structuring fee and estimated
offering expenses. We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units to make a cash
distribution to Noble."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    received as loans from our insiders described below. These funds will be
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including
    a deferred underwriting commission payable to the underwriters in an amount
    equal to 2% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering described
    below. We will have until 18 months from the closing of this offering to
    consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that
    we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 18
    months, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business
    combination up to three times, each by an additional month (for a total of
    up to 21 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms
    of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and the trust
    agreement to be entered into between us and American Stock Transfer & Trust
    Company, LLC on the date of this prospectus, in order to extend the time
    available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our
    insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice
    prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account
    $125,000, or $143,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full ($0.025 per unit in either case), up to an aggregate of
    $375,000 (or $431,250 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full), or $0.075 per unit, on or prior to the date of the
    applicable deadline, for each one month extension.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at
    approximately $525,000 even if the over-allotment option is exercised.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our
    intended use of proceeds. 

Our insiders (and/or their designees) have committed that they will purchase the
private units (for an aggregate purchase price of $4,025,000) from us on a
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.
Our insiders have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by
the underwriters in full or in part, they (and/or their designees) will purchase
from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of private units (up to a
maximum of 45,000 private units) that is necessary to maintain in the trust
account an amount equal to $10.30 per share of common stock sold to the public
in this offering. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be
placed in the trust account described below.

$51,500,000, or $59,225,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase, maintained by
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee. The funds held in the
trust account will be invested only in United States government treasury bills,
bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations,
the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption of 100% of
the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in
the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our
initial business combination to the extent not used to pay converting
stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Magna Management LLC, a company owned by our insiders, of a
monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. However, pursuant to the terms
of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination
by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to
pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business
combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and
payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business
combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by Magna Management LLC for our
benefit. We believe that the fee charged by Magna Management LLC is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination
or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than
the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s fees,
consulting fees or other similar compensation) will be paid to our insiders,
members of our management team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after our
initial business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $525,000.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
deferred underwriting commission payable to the underwriters in an amount equal
to 2% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon consummation of
our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used
in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination,
the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a
business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of June 30, 2016, M SPAC LLC, an entity controlled by Joshua Sason, our Chief
Executive Officer, had loaned to us $131,720 to be used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses. In
addition, an unrelated party had loaned to us $55,000 to cover expenses related
to this offering. The loans are payable without interest on the earlier of (i)
the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering or (ii) the date on which the
Company determines not to proceed with the Proposed Public Offering.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 21 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our insiders, officers and directors (and/or their designees)
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $200,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the
private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to
so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business
combination. If we do not complete a business combination, any loans and
advances from our insiders, officers and directors or their affiliates, will be
repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust account, if any.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any
tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

stock in this offering will be approximately $131.3 million, based upon the
initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of our common stock from us
is exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us would be
approximately $151.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital and
increase our financial flexibility, create a public market for our stock, and
increase our visibility in the marketplace. We currently intend to use the net
proceeds we receive from this offering to repay the entire outstanding balance
under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including working
capital, research and development activities, sales and marketing activities,
general and administrative matters and capital expenditures and to fund our
growth plans. We entered into a term loan under our credit facility in September
2013, or the 2013 Term Loan. In March 2016, we amended our credit facility to
add an additional $5.0 million term loan, or the 2016 Incremental Term Loan. As
of June 30, 2016, an aggregate of $35.7 million of principal was outstanding
under our credit facility. In August 2016, we amended our credit facility again,
pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $30 million under a new term loan,
or the 2016 Acquisition Term Loan. We used the proceeds from the 2016
Acquisition Term Loan and cash on hand to acquire Runbook, and we used the
proceeds from the 2016 Incremental Term Loan for general corporate purposes,
including working capital, research and development activities, sales and
marketing activities and general and administrative matters. Our credit facility
requires us to pay a prepayment premium of 1% of the amount prepaid under the
2013 Term Loan in the event of early prepayment prior to September 2016, up to
3% of the 2016 Incremental Term Loan for any prepayment prior to maturity and up
to 2% of the 2016 Acquisition Term Loan for any prepayment prior to maturity.
The 2013 Term Loan, 2016 Incremental Term Loan and 2016 Acquisition Term Loan
expire and mature on September 25, 2018. The 2013 Term Loan, the 2016
Incremental Term Loan and the 2016 Acquisition Term Loan each bear interest at
(i) the greater of LIBOR or 1.5% plus (ii) 8%, and can be paid in varying
amounts in cash or in kind. At June 30, 2016, the interest rate on the 2013 Term
Loan and 2016 Incremental Term Loan was 9.5%. We may also, in our discretion,
use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,
businesses, products, services, or technologies that complement our business,
although we have no current commitments or agreements to enter into any
acquisitions or investments. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the
net proceeds of this offering."

approximately US$1.4 billion, or approximately US$1.6 billion if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• Approximately US$800 million for land acquisition, facilities construction and 
  equipment purchase to expand our sorting capacity;

• Approximately US$300 million for the purchase of additional trucks to 
  strengthen our line-haul transportation capabilities; and

• Approximately US$250 million for general corporate purposes, including the 
  investment in our information technology system and potential strategic 
  transactions.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and 
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our 
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply 
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this prospectus. These   
    loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $900,000 of
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering       
    expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering    
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be    
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.                             

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of   
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the         
    completion of our initial business combination, $16,800,000, which          
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $19,320,000 if the   
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to   
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial        
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business    
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a    
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional  
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special  
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we 
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due   
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The 
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only 
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less 
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under   
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government      
    treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account  
    will be approximately $96,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02%  
    per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.      

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment   
    fees for financing.                                                         

Of the $491.60 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $565.04 million
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $480.00 million
($10.00 per unit), or $552.00 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $10.50
million, or up to $11.94 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing
of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The proceeds
held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $96,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.02% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding
this amount. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
our income taxes, if any, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our
initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of
our public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to
approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. Based on current
interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the trust account will be
sufficient to pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of 
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including 
pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation
of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative
services provided to members of our management team, in an amount not to exceed
$10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31,
2016 or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $900,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set forth above,
the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our
initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account."

common shares in this offering will be approximately $199.8 million, or 
approximately $230.1 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional common shares in full, based upon the initial public
offering price of $15.00 per common share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes:

• approximately $25.0 million to $33.0 million to fund our planned Phase 3   
  clinical program for relugolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding 
  associated with uterine fibroids;                              

• approximately $30.0 million to $40.0 million to fund our planned Phase 3 
  clinical program for relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis-associated 
  pain;                                             

• approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million to fund our planned Phase 3   
  clinical program for relugolix for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer;

• approximately $3.0 million to $5.0 million to fund a Phase 1 healthy-volunteer
  study in women followed by a planned proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial for 
  RVT-602 for the treatment of female infertility as part of assisted 
  reproduction; and                                              

• the remainder to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, which
  may include research and development of relugolix and RVT-602 for other    
  indications.                                                               

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. We believe the
net proceeds from this offering, allocated as set forth above, will enable us to
conduct each of the indicated planned clinical programs or trials, as
applicable, including through unblinding and release of data for at least one of
our Phase 3 programs, which we expect to occur in 2019; however, the amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our development, the status of and results
from preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that
we may enter into with third parties, and any unforeseen cash needs.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through the acquisition or in-license of complementary product
candidates. While we have no current agreements or commitments for any specific
acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion of the net
proceeds for these purposes.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. The
timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business.
Pending these uses, for a period of six months after the closing of this
offering, we plan to invest these net proceeds in a non-interest bearing
account. Thereafter, we may choose to invest these net proceeds in short-term,
interest bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States. The goal with
respect to the investment of these net proceeds is capital preservation and
liquidity so that such funds are readily available to fund our operations.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to enable
us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through
unblinding and release of data for at least one of our Phase 3 programs, which
we expect to occur in 2019. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may
prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner
than we currently expect."

stock in this offering will be approximately $83.5 million, or $96.3 million if
the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares,
based on the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together
with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $33.0 million to fund clinical development of RA101495 through
  the completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial in PNH patients;

• approximately $11.0 million to fund a Phase 2 clinical trial in rMG patients
  and a Phase 1b clinical trial in LN patients;

• approximately $18.9 million to advance our pipeline programs in Factor D, oral
  C5 inhibition and C1s; and

• the remainder, if any, for working capital and other general corporate
  purposes.

Based on our current plans, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents,
together with the net proceeds from this offering, will besufficient to fund our
operations into the third quarter of 2018.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. For example, we
may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses or
technologies to continue to build our pipeline, our research and development
capabilities and our intellectual property position, although we currently have
no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any such
transaction. We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts
that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our research and development, the status of and
results from non-clinical studies or clinical trials we may commence in the
future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties
for our product candidates or strategic opportunities that become available to
us, and any unforeseen cash needs. Moreover, we are unable to estimate the
allocation of proceeds between our rMG program and our LN program at this time
because we have not conducted separate clinical trials for these indications and
have not received FDA feedback on trial design for our planned clinical trials
in these indications. Likewise, we are unable to forecast future expenditures in
our pipeline programs in Factor D, oral C5 inhibition and C1s on a program by
program basis at this time because we have not conducted clinical trials or
received FDA feedback for these programs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Pending our use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation instruments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities."

• $7.8 million to pay a prepayment penalty in connection with the repayment
  of our Junior Term Loan; and 

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Certain of the proceeds of this indebtedness were used to fund some or all of
the Cretex Acquisition, the Sherman-Dixie Acquisition, the U.S. Pipe Acquisition
and the June 2016 dividend to Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.), L.P. discussed in the 
section entitled “Dividend Policy.”

Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc., each an underwriter in this offering, or their affiliates,
are lenders of approximately $0.3 million, $10.5 million and $3.0 million,
respectively, under our Junior Term Loan. Such underwriters, or their
affiliates, are expected to receive payments in respect of such amounts in
connection with the use of the net proceeds we receive in this offering to repay
our Junior Term Loan. These amounts represent less than 5%, in the aggregate, of
the net proceeds of this offering.

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we may
invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States government.

The selling stockholder will receive approximately $49.7 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares in
gross proceeds from this offering. We will not receive any proceeds from the
sale of shares by the selling stockholder."

million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based
on the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share and after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable
by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to expand our salesforce
and operations, increase our research and development activities, conduct or
sponsor clinical studies and trials, promote international expansion, and
provide for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty the specific allocations or
all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the
completion of this offering. Accordingly, our management and board of directors
will have broad discretion in the application and specific allocations of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
and board of directors regarding the application of the proceeds of this
offering.

Additionally, such expected uses represent our current intentions based upon our
present plans and market conditions. The amounts we actually expend in these
areas, and the timing thereof, may vary significantly from our current
intentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including future sales
growth, success of research and product development efforts, cash generated from
future operations and actual expenses to operate our business. We may use a
portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies or
businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete
any such transactions and are not involved in negotiations to do so.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments such as money market
funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and U.S. government securities."

offering, excluding the concurrent private placement, will be approximately
$48.3 million based on the initial public offering price of $14.00 per share,
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds will be
approximately $56.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

Bayer Global Investments B.V. has agreed to purchase from us concurrently with
this offering in a private placement $35 million of our common shares at a price
per share of $14.00, which is the initial public offering price. 

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets,
to increase our liquidity and to support continued development of our research
programs. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent
private placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as
follows:

• approximately $20.0 million to advance the development of our hemoglobinopathy
  programs;                                                 

• approximately $40.0 million to progress additional pipeline candidates;

• approximately $10.0 million to further optimize our CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
  platform and develop delivery technologies; and                    

• the remainder, if any, for manufacturing, working capital and general 
  corporate purposes.                                                        

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process,
it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds
from this offering and the concurrent private placement that may be used for the
above purposes. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend
upon numerous factors, including the results of our research and development
efforts, the timing and success of our ongoing preclinical studies or
preclinical studies we may commence in the future and the timing of regulatory
submissions. As a result, our management will have broad discretion over the use
of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement, and
investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net
proceeds. In addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue certain
preclinical activities if the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement and our other sources of cash are less than expected.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement,
along with our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest
thereon, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 24
months.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies or
technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or understandings
for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion
of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. and Swiss governments."

placement of approximately US$101.3 million, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions, the private placement agent fee and aggregate
offering expenses payable by us and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’
option to purchase additional equity shares. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from the sale of equity shares by the selling shareholders.

We intend to use US$100.0 million to fund the purchase by Azure Power Global
Limited of equity shares to be issued by AZI, which will occur contemporaneously
with the completion of this offering and the concurrent private placement.
Approximately US$1.3 million will be retained by Azure Power Global Limited to
fund its future operating expenses. To the extent the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional equity shares, the net proceeds from the
sale of the additional equity shares will be used to purchase additional equity
shares of AZI. Net proceeds of US$100.0 to be received by AZI pursuant to such
purchase are intended to be used for our growth capital requirement, for new 
project development and other general corporate purposes.

The foregoing use of our net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement represents our current intentions based upon our present plans
and business condition. The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary
depending on the amount of cash generated by our operations and our success at
solar auctions. Accordingly, our management will have significant discretion in
the allocation of the net proceeds we will receive from this offering and the
concurrent private placement. Depending on future events and other changes in
the business climate, we may determine at a later time to use the net proceeds
for different purposes.

Pending the use of the net proceeds, AZI intends to hold the proceeds from the
purchase of its equity shares by Azure Power Global Limited in short-term,
interest-bearing debt instruments or demand deposits."

approximately $4,022,000, based on an assumed initial public offering price of
$5.50 per share, which is the price set forth on the cover of this prospectus,
and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares, we estimate that we will receive an additional
$720,720 in net proceeds.
 
A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$5.50 would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by
$854,400.
 
We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:
 
. approximately $2,200,000 to continue clinical development and testing of
  MS1819;

. approximately $200,000 to advance our preclinical AZX1101 program;

. approximately $356,000 to repay convertible debt not being converted into

. shares of common stock in connection with this offering; and 

. the balance, if any, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We believe that the proceeds allocated to the MS1819 program will be sufficient
to enable us to conduct the necessary drug product formulation work, validation
and stabilization testing and conduct the program. We expect that the proceeds
allocated to AZX1101 will enable us to fund the additional preclinical studies
and prepare the safety and toxicology data necessary to file an IND with the
FDA; however, we will need to seek additional financing in order to pursue any
clinical program.
 
The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net proceeds
of the offering during the next 12 to 18 months. This estimate is based on
certain assumptions, including that no events occur which would cause us to
abandon any particular efforts, that our research, development and testing
activities will occur as projected, and that we do not enter into collaborations
to fund a project separately. The amounts actually expended for each purpose may
vary significantly in the event any of these assumptions prove inaccurate. We
reserve the right to change our use of proceeds as unanticipated events may
cause us to redirect our priorities and reallocate the proceeds accordingly.
Pending specific utilization of the net proceeds as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term investment grade and
U.S. government securities."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of 
    June 30, 2016, we had borrowed $175,000 under the promissory note with our 
    sponsor. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, our sponsor loaned us an additional 
    $125,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These 
    loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000 
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held
    in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as 
    set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing 
    working capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more 
    than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held 
    in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $10,500,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or up to $12,075,000 if the underwriters'
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the
    underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining
    funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial
    business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including
    payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection
    with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other
    companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to
    any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.

(4) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed
    estimates.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from
    the trust account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect
    approximately $60,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the
    funds held in the trust account over 12 months following the investment of
    such funds in specified U.S. Government Treasury bills beginning in January
    2017; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In
    addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
    intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
    sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated
    to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
    combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the
    trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only
    out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial
    business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
    capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
    proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts.
    Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price
    of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be
    identical to the private placement warrants issued to our initial
    shareholders. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our
    sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors, if any, have not been
    determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
    do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an
    affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing
    to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek
    access to funds in our trust account.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a 'no shop"" provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

The rules of the NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from
this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the
net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
$300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including $10,500,000 (or up to $12,075,000 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering, be
placed in a non-interest bearing U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.
Beginning in January 2017, the funds in the trust account will be invested only
in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $60,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.02% per year, following the investment of such funds in
specified U.S. government treasury bills or in specified money market funds
beginning in January 2017. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the
principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of
interest to pay taxes, if any, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until
the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the
redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem 100%
of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that interest
earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial 
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the 
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we 
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to 
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of June 
30, 2016, we had borrowed $175,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor. 
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, our sponsor loaned us an additional $125,000 to be 
used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are 
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2016 
or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon the closing of 
this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust 
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants issued to our initial shareholders. The terms of such loans
by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from
parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination 
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any such 
transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder 
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial 
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans 
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms 
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, 
they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any 
material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases 
are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently 
anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject 
to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction 
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the 
purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are 
subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net 
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC's ""penny stock""
rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require as a
closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or 
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business 
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business 
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in 
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum 
and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation 
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business 
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the 
redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial 
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, 
subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder 
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant 
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our 
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders, officers 
and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions 
from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to 
complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. 
However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating 
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we 
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

$230.4 million (or $265.5 million if the underwriters exercise their option in
full to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock), after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering (including any net proceeds
from any exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock) to purchase 11,363,636 common units (or 13,068,181 common
units if the underwriters exercise their option in full to purchase additional
shares of Class A common stock) directly from CWGS, LLC at a price per unit
equal to the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock in
this offering less the underwriting discounts and commissions.

CWGS, LLC intends to use the $230.4 million in net proceeds it receives from the
sale of common units to Camping World Holdings, Inc. (together with any
additional proceeds it may receive if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) as follows:

• approximately $200.4 million to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings
  under our Term Loan Facility, including $100.0 million of borrowings used to
  pay a distribution to its members as part of the Recapitalization (the Term
  Loan Facility is scheduled to mature on February 20, 2020 and had an interest
  rate of 5.75% as of June 30, 2016); and

• the remainder for general corporate purposes.

invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States government."

proceeds from the concurrent private placement will be $4.7 million after
deducting the placement agent fee.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds that we receive
from this offering and the concurrent private placement for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including an estimated payment of $8.5 million
due to GLOBALFOUNDRIES in December 2016, research and development activities,
sales and marketing activities and capital expenditures, to enhance existing and
develop new products, expand our manufacturing capabilities and to fund our
growth. The amount due to GLOBALFOUNDRIES by December 16, 2016, is for agreed
upon project costs which bear interest at a rate of 14% per annum pursuant to
our joint development agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, as amended. We will make
this payment by or before December 16, 2016. We may also use a portion of the
net proceeds that we receive from this offering and the concurrent private
placement for investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses,
products, services, technologies or other assets. We have not entered into any
agreements or commitments with respect to any investments or acquisitions at
this time.

We currently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds that we
receive from this offering other than with respect to the payment to
GLOBALFOUNDRIES set forth above. Accordingly, our management will have broad
discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement. Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering

short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of

offering to repay outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan B portion of our
Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Term Loan B borrowings accrue interest at
3.75% (as of June 30, 2016) and mature October 2019. On February 4, 2016, we 
obtained lender consent for certain amendments to our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, including the extension of the maturity of the commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the effectiveness of which is conditioned on the
consummation of this offering and a minimum paydown of $100.0 million of
borrowings under our Term Loan B (the ""Minimum Debt Paydown"") with the net
proceeds of this offering. In connection with the amendment to our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, we paid total fees of approximately $5.2 million,
which was paid to the lenders and the administrative agent, at the closing of
the consent.

On August 4, 2016, we entered into a waiver to our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities to waive the IPO condition to the extension of the maturity of the
commitments under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities referred to above. As a
result of the execution of the amendment and waiver, the maturity date with
respect to approximately $280 million of the $300 million of commitments under

follows:

. approximately $33.0 million to $40.0 million for the commercialization of our
  Obalon balloon system, including $30.0 million to $35.0 million for the
  development of our sales and marketing infrastructure and $3.0 million to 
  $5.0 million for the expansion of our manufacturing facilities; 

. approximately $13.0 million to $15.0 million for continued research and
  development efforts; and 

. the remaining for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and expected revenue, will
be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at
least two years following this offering. In the future, we may need additional
funds to complete the development and commercialization of advancements to our
existing Obalon balloon system as well as our additional products under
development.

This expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts we
actually expend in these areas, and the timing thereof, may vary significantly
from our current intentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including
future sales growth, success of research and product development efforts, cash
generated from future operations and actual expenses to operate our business. We
may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary products,
technologies or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or
commitments to complete any such transactions and are not involved in
negotiations to do so.

particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this
offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this
offering.

this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities such

The foregoing presentation is based on reasonable estimates made by our
management; it should be noted, however, that, except with respect to the
purchase price for the Target Assets and the businesses of the Target Companies,
our management will have the discretion to allocate such net proceeds as it
determines. Further, the amount and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend on numerous factors, including the cash used in or generated by our
operations, the pace of the integration of the Target Companies’ businesses, the
level of our sales and marketing activities and the attractiveness of any
additional acquisitions or investments. We believe that, in the event only the
minimum amount of this offering is completed, we will have sufficient proceeds
nonetheless to fund all of the uses described in the table above under
“Minimum”. If, however, we begin to experience an operating loss, we will be
required to fund that loss out of such proceeds. In such event, we will
reconsider our use of up to $225,000 for potential future business acquisitions
and reallocate such amount to working capital. Until we use the proceeds from
this offering as described above, we plan to invest such proceeds in highly
liquid short-term interest-bearing obligations, investment grade investments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government."

offering will be approximately $103.5 million, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters' option to purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full,
we estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately $119.9 million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our ordinary shares and facilitate our
future access to the public equity markets.

In September 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire all
of the outstanding shares of ADB and all of the rights and obligations under a
design and construction contract for a desalination plant and related 
infrastructure located in Peru. We currently intend to use approximately
$45 million, subject to adjustments, of the net proceeds that we will receive
from this offering to fund this acquisition. We currently intend to use the
remainder of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes. We have broad discretion
as to the application of the proceeds used for working capital and other general
corporate purposes. We may use a portion of the net proceeds that we receive to
acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, services, technologies
or other assets. As part of our expansion strategy, we may acquire complementary
businesses. For our Seven Seas Water business, we may seek to acquire additional
desalination and water treatment plants. Potential acquisition candidates
include individual plants and businesses that operate multiple plants. For our
Quench business, potential acquisition candidates include local dealers as well
as businesses with broader regional or national customer bases. We routinely
identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates and engage in discussions
and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions. There can be no assurance
that any of our discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition.
Further, if we make any acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be
able to operate the acquired plants or businesses profitably or otherwise
successfully implement our expansion strategy. Other than the purchase and sale
agreement described above, we currently do not have any agreements or
commitments to make any acquisitions or investments.

Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to
invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term and
intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade investments,
certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government. You will not have an opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial
or other information on which we base our decisions regarding the use of these
proceeds."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
    received in the form of a loan we received from our sponsor, as described
    below. This loan will be repaid out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds
    that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses other than
    underwriting commissions. As of the date of this prospectus, we have drawn
    down an aggregate of $50,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor.
    This loan is unsecured and bears interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus
    0.60%.    

(2) Includes underwriting discounts and commissions equal to 5.50% of the gross 
    proceeds from the sale of the units in the offering, or $8,250,000 (or      
    $9,487,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full),
    of which $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment      
    option is exercised in full) will be deposited in the trust account and     
    which the underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our
    initial business combination. If we consummate our initial business
    combination, $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters as deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions. If we fail to consummate our
    initial business combination meeting the criteria described herein within
    24 months from the closing of this offering, the underwriters have agreed
    to waive their right to these deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.                                                            

(3) The amount of net proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private   
    placement warrants not held in the trust account will remain constant at    
    $1,000,000 even if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised.    

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include investment earnings available to us from   
    the trust account.                                                          

After estimated non-deferred expenses of this offering and the private
placement, $150,000,000 (or $172,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) will be placed in a trust account in Belgium at KBC
Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.
Except for payment of taxes and investment earnings earned, after taxes payable,
on the trust account to fund our working capital requirements, the proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of
our initial business combination or our liquidation (after payment or provision
for our then current and estimated future liabilities). All remaining proceeds
held in the trust account, including investment earnings earned (after taxes
payable on such income and after reservation for any taxes assessed against us
by any governmental or taxing authority) on the trust account, will be available
for use in consummating our initial business combination and for payment of the
deferred underwriting discounts and commissions or will be released to public
shareholders upon exercise of their conversion rights or to public shareholders
entitled to receive liquidating distributions upon our liquidation (after
payment or provision for our then current and estimated future liabilities), as
the case may be. We may not use all of the funds remaining in the trust account
in connection with our initial business combination (and related conversion
rights), either because the consideration for the initial business combination
is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our equity or debt securities or other borrowings. In
that event, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will constitute
working capital for our business after our initial business combination.

Our sponsor has provided an unsecured loan in the amount of up to $250,000 to us
to be used for the payment of certain of our offering expenses listed in the
table above, which will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the
$1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of
offering expenses. As of the date of this prospectus, we have drawn down an
aggregate of $50,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor. This loan is
unsecured and bears interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus 0.60%.

We have allocated $1,000,000 of the net proceeds from this offering and proceeds
from the sale of the private placement warrants to fund a portion of our working
capital. We intend to fund a portion of our working capital requirements from a
portion of the investment earnings earned (after taxes payable) on the trust
account. Under the terms of the investment management trust agreement,
investment earnings may be released to us in such amounts and at such intervals
as we request, subject to availability. Although we do not know the rate of
interest to be earned on the trust account and are unable to predict an exact
amount of time it will take to complete an initial business combination, we
believe that following the completion of this offering, it will take some time
to find a prospective target business and take all of the steps necessary to
complete an initial business combination. In order to fund working capital
deficiencies, if any, or to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, we may be required to seek loans or
additional investments from our executive officers, directors or initial
shareholders or from third parties. However, none of our executive officers,
directors or initial shareholders or any third party is under any obligation to
advance funds to us or to invest in us in such circumstances.

Our operating expenses prior to our initial business combination will include,
but not be limited to, deposits or down payments for a proposed initial business
combination, legal, accounting and other expenses, including due diligence
expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the investigation, structuring and negotiation of our initial business
combination, director and officer liability insurance premiums and reserves,
legal and accounting fees, brokers’ retainer fees, consulting fees and finder’s
fees. We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our executive officers and directors, and also that
it may include engaging an accounting firm or other third-party consultants. No
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our executive officers or directors, or corporate shareholder or any
of our or their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, including
in connection with such due diligence activities, other than compensation paid
to our non-executive director(s). However, our executive officers and directors
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel 
expenses) incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on a 
suitable initial business combination, and our sponsor, or an affiliate thereof,
will be entitled to receive payments of an aggregate of $10,000 per month for 
office space, secretarial support and administrative services. We believe that,
based on rents and fees for similar services in Antwerp, Belgium, the fees 
charged by our sponsor, or such affiliates thereof, are at least as favorable as
we could have obtained from unaffiliated third parties. All payments made to our
executive officers, directors and initial shareholders and our or their 
affiliates, other than the $10,000 per month payment described above, must be 
reviewed and approved by the members of our audit committee or a majority of our
disinterested directors.

While it is difficult to determine what the specific operating expenses of our
business after consummation of our initial business combination may be, we
expect that they may include some or all of the following: capital expenditures,
general ongoing expenses, including overhead, payroll and costs involved in
expanding markets and in developing strategic acquisitions or alliances. In
addition, we may use any remaining proceeds held in the trust account to satisfy
any unpaid reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our executive
officers and directors, as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or similar fees or
compensation, to the extent such expenses, fees or compensation exceed the sum
of the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and proceeds
properly withdrawable by us from the trust account.

In addition, it is also possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in
the trust account to pay finder’s fees, consulting fees or other similar
compensation, or make a deposit or down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision
with respect to a particular proposed initial business combination. In the event
that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of
our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), if the
amount were large enough and we had already used up the other funds available to
us, we could be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for other
potential target businesses or otherwise fund our business. In such case, if we
were unable to secure additional financing, we would most likely fail to
consummate an initial business combination in the allotted time and be forced to
liquidate.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account as well as the investment
earnings earned (after taxes payable) on the trust account that may be released
to us will be sufficient to pay our costs prior to, and in connection with, our
initial business combination as contemplated herein. This belief is based on the
fact that in-depth due diligence will most likely be undertaken only after we
have negotiated and signed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or
definitive agreement for an initial business combination or other preliminary
agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business combination. However,
if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and 
negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount of
such costs, we may be required to raise additional capital, the availability,
amount and cost of which is currently unascertainable and cannot be assured. To
the extent that such costs exceed the amounts not held in the trust account and
the investment earnings earned (after taxes payable) on the trust account that
may be released to us from the trust account, such costs may not be reimbursed
by us unless and until we consummate an initial business combination. The role
of our executive officers and directors after an initial business combination is
uncertain and we have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any,
will be paid to our executive officers and directors after our initial business
combination. Our executive officers and directors may, as part of any such
business combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of the costs
incurred by them that have not been reimbursed by us prior to the initial
business combination’s closing. If the target business’ owners do not agree to
such repayment, this could cause our executive officers and directors to view
such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in a
conflict of interest.

If we do not have sufficient funds available to cover our costs, we may be
required to seek additional financing from our executive officers, our
directors, our initial shareholders or third parties. We may not be able to
obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, and no party,
including our executive officers, our directors, our initial shareholders or
third parties, is obligated to provide any additional financing to us. If we
fail to obtain the necessary additional financing, we may be required to
liquidate prior to consummating our initial business combination.

The net proceeds of this offering and the proceeds from the sale of the private
placement warrants that are not immediately required for the purposes set forth
above, as well as deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, will be held
in the trust account and invested only in United States “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a
maturity of 180 days or less or money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act or securities
issued by the United States so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act.

Other than (i) the repayment of the loan from our sponsor, or an affiliate
thereof, described above, (ii) administrative fees relating to office space,
secretarial support and administrative services provided to us, and (iii) the
payment of compensation to our non-executive director(s) no compensation of any
kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid to any of our
executive officers, directors or initial shareholders or any of their respective
affiliates prior to or in connection with the initial business combination.
However, our executive officers and directors may receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account,
including investment earnings earned on their pro rata portion of the funds in
the trust account (less up to $100,000 of investment earnings to pay dissolution
expenses and which investment earnings shall be net of taxes payable and any
amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements) only in the event
of our liquidation upon our failure to consummate our initial business
combination meeting the criteria described herein within 24 months from the
closing of this offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in
principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination. In no
other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account."

ordinary shares (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) in the U.S.
offering and European placement of approximately $21.4 million, after deducting
the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs and/or ADS
Warrants in full in the U.S. offering, we estimate that the aggregate net
proceeds from the offerings will be approximately $24.2 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the offerings, as follows:

• approximately $20.5 million to fund the expenses to be incurred in conducting
  the two Phase 3 clinical trials of iclaprim for the treatment of ABSSSI,
  including the completion of our REVIVE-1 trial; and

• the remainder for working capital, general and administrative expenses,
  research and development expenses, and other general corporate purposes.

We anticipate needing an additional $12 million to complete our REVIVE-2 trial.
We hope to raise the additional capital through public or private financings and
or other partnering opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we
will be successful in raising additional capital.

Our expected use of net proceeds from the offerings represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including the relative success and cost of our research, preclinical
and clinical development programs, our ability to obtain additional financing,
the status of and results from clinical trials, and whether regulatory
authorities require us to perform additional clinical trials in order to obtain
regulatory approvals. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in
the application of the net proceeds of this offering, and investors will be
relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds. In
addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue certain preclinical
activities or clinical trials if the net proceeds from this offering and our
other sources of cash are less than expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing investments."

revolving credit facility matures March 28, 2019 and bears interest at a
variable rate. At June 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on
borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility was 4.47%. We also pay a
commitment fee on unused amounts of our revolving credit facility of 37.5 basis
points. The outstanding borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility
were incurred primarily to fund a portion of our 2014 and 2015 capital
expenditures. In connection with the completion of this offering, we expect to
terminate our existing revolving credit facility."

(1) We started our repair and maintenance service business in 2015. We provide  
    pharmaceutical manufacturers repair and maintenance services after the      
    expiration of their product and installation service warranties. We have    
    established a repair and maintenance center in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province to 
    cover Eastern China (Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, Anhui Province and
    Shanghai) with an investment of RMB 2,452,684 (approximately $400,000). Over
    the next 3 years, we plan to use a portion of the net proceeds of this 
    offering to establish five additional repair and maintenance centers in 
    Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Chengdu and Linyi respectively to cover Central
    China, Northeastern China, Northern China, Southern China, and Northwestern
    China, with Shanghai being the center. We anticipate that the proceeds of 
    this offering will be sufficient to fund these new centers. To the extent we
    raise proceeds upon maximum offering, we would further devote more proceeds
    to increase the size and scope of each repair and maintenance center.

(2) We anticipate using a portion of this offering to settle taxes due for the  
    company. The amount of taxes due is not presently determinable, and may     
    exceed the amount allocated to this item. To the extent this is the case, we
    anticipate using operating cash flows from the company to cover such        
    shortfall. However we cannot guarantee that such operating cash flows will  
    be available.

In order to grow our installation services business, we need to be able to
perform more projects at the same time. Due to limited unrestricted cash to pay
for advances to subcontractors in different projects, we are generally limited
to two projects at the same time. With the proceeds from this offering, we will
aim to conduct two to four more projects simultaneously. As the capacity to
perform more projects at the same time increases, we plan to add three more
branch offices with six new employees for sales or technology support to each
new office to guarantee our services to clients. We expect the new branch
offices will be located in Linyi in Shandong Province, Chengdu in Sichuan
Province and Nanjing in Jiangsu Province (in addition to the current one in
Nanjing) respectively. We currently do not have any plans to expand our
installation services through acquiring any assets or businesses.

In addition, we intend to establish an online store for our products and
services with the net proceeds from this offering. With the help from an
unrelated third-party web design and maintenance company, we have already
initially set up our own online store website in the form of a
Business-to-Business platform. Though the website is set up, it is still in the
process of technical testing and improvement without being promoted or operated.
We will develop our own operation administration, internet technology team,
online store maintenance offices, product storage, and logistic and delivery
center to provide our customers with online consulting, online ordering,
delivery, installation, and after-sales service. We plan to begin by building
our online store team and facilities to conduct market research and analysis
about online store operation. When we complete our analysis, we will maintain
our platform website, test and promote the website and put it into daily
operation. We will also provide initial consulting services regarding our
holistic production technique solution services for pharmaceutical engineering
and food manufacturing systems. We currently do not have any plans to use any
third-party online stores as our platform for online service. Also, we do not
currently plan to establish our online store through acquiring any assets or
businesses.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our common shares. It is possible that we may become a
passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers, which
could result in negative tax consequences to you."

approximately $212 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional ADSs from us in full), after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and expenses of this offering.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the Selling
Shareholders. The Selling Shareholders will receive all of the proceeds from
their sales of their ADSs in this offering, after commissions payable to the
underwriters. Expenses of this offering will be paid by us.

The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, increase our public profile and awareness, create a public market
for the ADSs and to facilitate our future access to public equity markets. We
have not quantified or allocated any specific portion of the net proceeds to us
or range of the net proceeds to us for any particular purpose. We anticipate
that we will use the net proceeds we receive from this offering, including any
net proceeds we receive from the exercise of the underwriters’ option to acquire
additional ADSs in this offering, for general corporate purposes, including to
fund investments in technology, for working capital to fund our growth
strategies described elsewhere in this prospectus and to pursue strategic
acquisitions, although we have no agreements, commitments or understandings with
respect to any such transaction. Immediately upon the closing of this offering,
a substantial portion of the proceeds to us from this offering will be
transferred to trivago GmbH in exchange for new units issued by trivago GmbH.

The amount of what, and timing of when, we actually spend for these purposes may
vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future
revenue and cash generated by operations and Accordingly, our management board 
and supervisory board will have broad discretion in deploying the net proceeds 
of this offering.

Pending their use, we plan to hold the net proceeds from this offering in cash
and cash equivalents."

offering price of $15.50 (14.71 euros) per ADS.

We have already paid and accounted for approximately $4.6 million of the
estimated $6.2 million aggregate expenses related to this offering, as reflected
in our financial statements for 2014 and 2015 and for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2016.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes:

• With respect to Cx601 in the United States, to complete the process of
  technology transfer to Lonza, a U.S.-based contract manufacturing 
  organization, to file an investigational new drug application to conduct a
  pivotal Phase III trial to register Cx601 in the United States supporting a
  biologics license application with the FDA and to commence recruitment of
  patients for the Phase III trial (approximately $21.2 million).

• To advance the Phase II clinical development of Cx611 in severe sepsis until
  well into the stage of recruitment (approximately $6.3 million).

• To advance the development of AlloCSC-01 in acute myocardial infarction until
  the end of PhaseI/II clinical development (approximately $4.0 million).

• The remainder for general corporate purposes, including research and
  development and working capital requirements.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds. The occurrence of unforeseen events or
changed business conditions could result in the application of the net proceeds
of this offering in a manner other than as described above. Pending our use of
the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term bank deposits or interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

As of September 30, 2016, WildHorse had $108.5 million of outstanding borrowings
under the WildHorse revolving credit facility. Since that date and prior to the
consummation of this offering, WildHorse has borrowed or expects to borrow an
additional $3.5 million, resulting in approximately $112.0 million of
outstanding borrowings under its credit facility prior to the completion of this
offering. The WildHorse revolving credit facility matures on August 8, 2018 and
bears interest at a variable rate, which was 3.03% per annum at September 30,
2016. Borrowings under the WildHorse revolving credit facility were incurred
primarily to fund WildHorse’s capital expenditures and leasehold acquisitions.

As of September 30, 2016, Esquisto had $125.0 million of outstanding borrowings
under the Esquisto revolving credit facility. Since that date and prior to the
consummation of this offering, Esquisto has borrowed or expects to borrow an
additional $30.0 million, resulting in approximately $155.0 million of
outstanding borrowings under its credit facility prior to the completion of this
offering. The Esquisto revolving credit facility matures on July 22, 2020 and
bears interest at a variable rate, which averaged 2.79% per annum at
September 30, 2016. Borrowings under the Esquisto revolving credit facility were
incurred primarily to fund Esquisto’s capital expenditures and leasehold
acquisitions, including the Comstock Acquisition. As of September 30, 2016,
Esquisto had $9.6 million in principal amount of notes payable to certain of its
members. The Esquisto notes payable to members are payable to such members by
December 31, 2022 and bear interest after a year at the Applicable Federal Rate
compounded annually, paid at maturity. Borrowings from Esquisto’s members were
incurred primarily to fund general and administrative expenses incurred on
behalf of Esquisto.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under the WildHorse
revolving credit facility and/or the Esquisto revolving credit facility and
accordingly will receive 5% or more of the net proceeds of this offering due to
the repayment of borrowings under such credit facilities. Accordingly, this

ordinary shares in this offering will be approximately $46.7 million, and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate
that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $54.1 million,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to fund
our operations and growth, to create a public market for our ordinary shares and
to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We expect to use
approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering to repay
outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facilities, of which approximately $25.0
million is expected be used to repay borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and
approximately $15.0 million is expected be used to repay borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facility. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes, which we expect to include funding working capital,
operating expenses and the selective pursuit of business development
opportunities in our focus segment areas. At this time, other than the repayment
of indebtedness under our Credit Facilities, we have not specifically identified
a large single use for which we intend to use the net proceeds, and,
accordingly, we are not able to allocate the net proceeds among any of these
potential uses in light of the variety of factors that will impact how such net
proceeds are ultimately utilized by us. Pending use of the proceeds from this
offering, we intend to invest the proceeds in a variety of capital preservation
investments, including short-term, investment-grade and interest-bearing
instruments.

In April 2016, we increased our Term Loan Facility by an additional principal
amount of $15.0 million to finance, along with $4.0 million under our Revolving
Credit Facility, the Ajax Acquisition.

As of September 23, 2016, we had $66.3 million of indebtedness outstanding under
our Term Loan Facility and $15.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under our
Revolving Credit Facility, which Credit Facilities mature on August 11, 2020.
The outstanding amount of our Term Loan Facility reflected in our consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus is net of
$2.0 million of debt discount. Borrowings under our Credit Facilities bear
interest (x) for base rate loans, at the “base rate” (as defined below) plus
3.00% or (y) for eurodollar loans, at the “eurodollar rate” (as defined below)
plus 4.00%. The base rate equals the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the
federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the eurodollar rate plus
1.00%. The eurodollar rate equals LIBOR, provided that with respect to our Term
Loan Facility only, LIBOR shall not be less than 1.00%. As of September 23,
2016, the applicable interest rate under our Credit Facilities was 4.89% per
annum. No prepayment penalty is owed with respect to the prepayment we intend to
make using proceeds of this offering."

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• $7.0 million to commercialize and launch our first product candidate, 
  ContraPest, in the United States, and seeking regulatory approval, 
  commercializing and launching ContraPest in other countries;  

• $3.0 million for further development of ContraPest and other product  
  candidates;

• $2.0 million for capital expenditures associated with manufacturing 
  ContraPest;              

• A cash payment of $175,890 to the holder of all of the shares of our Series A
  convertible preferred stock for its agreement to waive all accrued dividends
  on the Series A convertible preferred stock and convert all of its shares of 
  Series A convertible preferred stock into common stock immediately prior to 
  the consummation of this offering; and 

• The remainder to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, which
  may include the development of other product candidates and bio-synthetic  
  sources of one of the active ingredients in ContraPest, and acquisition or 
  licensing of additional product candidates, technologies, complementary    
  businesses or other assets. 

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including
the progress of our product development efforts and market acceptance of our
products. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in applying the
net proceeds from this offering. Pending the use of proceeds described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash resources, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations for at
least 12 months following the completion of this offering, including funding the
commercial launch of our first product candidate, ContraPest. We have based this
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

To the extent the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option to purchase
shares from us and from the two selling stockholders, we will not receive any
proceeds from any sale of shares by the selling stockholders. The selling
stockholders include Loretta P. Mayer, Ph.D., our chair of the board and chief
executive officer, and Cheryl A. Dyer, Ph.D., our president and a director."

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from our sale of common stock in
this offering as follows: approximately $1.5 million for new product research
and development, including development of a 200 kW DC power system;
approximately $1.5 million for existing product development and
commercialization; approximately $2.0 million for development of international
markets, including setting up subsidiaries in key target markets in Asia and
Sub-Saharan territories; approximately $3.0 million to manufacture rental units
of DC power systems for use in the U.S. telecommunications market; approximately
$2.0 million for the purchase of raw materials and component parts, such as
engines, with long lead times; and approximately $4.5 million for general
corporate purposes.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including, among other things, the cash generated by our operations and the rate
of growth, if any, of our business. As a result, our management will retain
broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We
may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering
for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of net
proceeds.
 
Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash flow from
operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months.

funding certain of our expenses in connection with our organization, this
offering, the acquisition of our Initial Property and other costs. We will
reimburse IGP Advisers for those expenses incurred by it with the net proceeds
of this offering.

We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to our Operating
Partnership. Our Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds of this
offering as follows:

• approximately $30 million, or 49% of the estimated net proceeds of $60.8 
  million, to acquire our Initial Property, including acquisition costs of   
  $50,000 (of which $20,000 will be paid by us as a reimbursement to IGP

  of $375,000;

  after November 15, 2016 (if the closing of this offering occurs on December 5,
  2016, we will pay IGP Advisers an additional $66,000).                       

We intend to invest the remaining net proceeds in specialized industrial real
estate assets that support the regulated medical-use cannabis industry that are
consistent with our investment strategy. Our general goal is to invest the
remaining net proceeds within six to 12 months following completion of this
offering, which will depend on the amount of time necessary to evaluate a target
property’s suitability based on our acquisition criteria. However, we cannot
predict if or when we will identify and acquire properties that meet our
acquisition criteria so as to permit us to invest the net proceeds of this
offering.

Until appropriate assets can be identified, we may invest the net proceeds of
the offering in interest-bearing short-term investments that are consistent with
our intention to qualify as a REIT. Any interest-bearing short-term investment
we make likely will provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from
our target assets."
