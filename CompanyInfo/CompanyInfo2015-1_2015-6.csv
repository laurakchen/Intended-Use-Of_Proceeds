this offering will be approximately $56.9 million, or approximately $65.9 
million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based 
on the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share and after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable 
by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including payment of scheduled interest and
principal on our credit facility with PDL Biopharma, or the credit agreement. As
of September 30, 2014, we had $21.4 million in principal and interest
outstanding under the credit agreement. The interest rate under the credit
agreement is 12.0% per annum plus a 1.8% royalty on net revenues and the
interest rate under the notes is equal to the 30-day LIBOR plus 6% per annum.
During 2015 we expect to use $2.0 million to make scheduled principal payments
under the credit agreement. As of September 30, 2014, we had $12.4 million in
principal plus accrued interest outstanding under the convertible promissory
notes. While we do not have any current plans to allocate the net proceeds of
this offering for the redemption of these notes, if we do redeem the notes we
would pay each holder an amount equal to the greater of (i) 125% of the
principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) the principal plus an amount
equivalent to a 20% annual return on investment under such notes.

This expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts we
actually expend in these areas, and the timing thereof, may vary significantly
from our current intentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including
future sales growth, success of research and product development efforts, cash
generated from future operations and actual expenses to operate our business. We
may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary products,
technologies or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or
commitments to complete any such transactions and are not involved in
negotiations to do so.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of
the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of
this offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest
the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments such as money market
funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and U.S. government securities."
"INFRAREIT, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/infrareit-inc-842318-77270,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/infrareit-inc-842318-77270,424B4,2/2/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10441920,"We expect to receive proceeds from this offering of approximately $431.0 
million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the 
underwriter structuring fee. We will use $107.8 million of the proceeds from 
this offering to fund the cash portion of the consideration to be issued in the 
Merger. We will contribute the remaining $323.2 million of the proceeds we 
receive from this offering to our Operating Partnership in exchange for common 
units. We expect our Operating Partnership will use the proceeds from this 
offering that it receives from us (i) to repay an aggregate of $1.0 million 
of indebtedness to Hunt Consolidated, Inc. pursuant to a promissory note, 
(ii) to repay indebtedness outstanding under our Operating Partnership’s 
revolving credit facility and under SDTS’s revolving credit facility, which, 
as of January 20, 2015, was approximately $72.0 million and $132.0 million, 
respectively, (iii) to pay offering expenses (other than the underwriting 
discounts and commissions and the underwriter structuring fee), estimated to 
be $5.6 million and (iv) for general corporate purposes. 

On November 20, 2014, Hunt Consolidated, Inc. loaned $1.0 million to InfraREIT,
Inc. The promissory note bears interest at 2.5%, compounded annually and is due
on the earlier of November 1, 2015 and the completion of this offering. The
proceeds from this promissory note were used to purchase stock in other publicly
traded REITs prior to this offering. We do not expect to invest in other
publicly traded securities in the future.

As of September 30, 2014, the Operating Partnership had $118.5 million of
indebtedness outstanding under its prior credit facility at a 2.66% interest
rate. On December 10, 2014, the Operating Partnership entered into a new
$75.0 million revolving credit facility that will mature on December 10, 2019
and terminated its prior credit facility after repaying the prior facility with
proceeds of its new revolving credit facility and proceeds of SDTS’s amended and
restated revolving credit facility described below. Borrowings under the new
credit facility bear interest, at the Operating Partnership’s election, at a
rate equal to (1) the one, two, three or six-month LIBOR plus 2.5%, or (2) a
base rate (equal to the highest of (A) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%,
(B) the Bank of America prime rate and (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1%) plus 1.5%.
Borrowings made under the Operating Partnership’s prior credit facility within
the last twelve months were used primarily to fund capital expenditures.

As of September 30, 2014, SDTS had $75.0 million of indebtedness outstanding
under its revolving credit facility at a 2.15% interest rate. On December 10,
2014, the SDTS credit agreement was amended and restated in order to, among
other things, increase the amount of the revolving credit facility to a total of
$250.0 million. The revolving credit facility matures on December 10, 2019, and
borrowings bear interest, at SDTS’s option, at a rate per annum equal to either
(1) a base rate, determined as the greatest of (A) the administrative agent’s
prime rate, (B) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (C) LIBOR
plus 1.00% per annum, plus a margin of 1.00% per annum or (2) LIBOR plus a
margin of 2.00% per annum. Borrowings made under SDTS’s revolving credit
facility within the last twelve months were used primarily to fund capital
expenditures.

Affiliates of the underwriters are lenders under the Operating Partnership’s
revolving credit facility and SDTS’s revolving credit facility and will, in that
respect, receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering through the
repayment of such indebtedness."
"SPARK THERAPEUTICS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/spark-therapeutics-inc-936549-77349,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/spark-therapeutics-inc-936549-77349,424B4,1/30/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10438153,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us of the sale of the common stock that we
are offering will be approximately $146.7 million, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares
in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $169.2 million.

As of September 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $67.3 million. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

.  approximately $12.0 million to fund external research and development 
   expenses for our lead product candidate SPK-RPE65 for the treatment of 
   inherited retinal dystrophies caused by RPE65 mutations;  

.  approximately $11.0 million to fund external research and development 
   expenses for our product candidate SPK-CHM for the treatment of 
   choroideremia;         

.  approximately $6.0 million to fund external research and development 
   expenses for our SPK-FIX program for the treatment of hemophilia B;

.  approximately $17.0 million to fund external research and development 
   expenses for preclinical product candidates; and      

.  the remainder for working capital, general and administrative expenses,
   internal research and development expenses and other general corporate 
   purposes, including pre-commercial activities, in-licenses and potential
   acquisitions.              

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary products or
technologies or acquisitions of companies with complementary products or
technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or understandings
for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion
of the net proceeds for these purposes.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of, and results from,
clinical trials, the potential need to conduct additional clinical trials to
obtain approval of our product candidates for all intended indications, as well
as any additional collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for
our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents, along with the $20.0 million upfront payment received
under the Pfizer collaboration, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient
to enable us to complete the submission of a BLA and prepare for
commercialization of SPK-RPE65, complete our Phase 1/2 trial for SPK-CHM,
complete our planned Phase 1/2 trial for our lead SPK-FIX product candidate in
collaboration with Pfizer, advance certain of our other pipeline product
candidates and fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
into 2018. The foregoing estimate does not contemplate the receipt of any
milestone payments under our collaboration with Pfizer. Moreover, we have based
this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the proceeds
in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

We estimate that the net proceeds to us of the sale of the Class A common
stock that we are offering will be approximately $97.7 million, after deducting
the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions, but before estimated
offering expenses. Our management will have broad discretion over the uses of
the net proceeds in this offering.

We intend to cause SSE Holdings to use the proceeds it receives as follows:
(i) to pay fees and expenses of approximately $3.0 million in connection with
this offering and the Transactions, (ii) to repay the outstanding borrowings
under our Revolving Credit Facility of approximately $36.0 million, including
approximately $21.9 million of borrowings used to pay the distribution to
certain of the Original SSE Equity Owners, and (iii) approximately $58.7 million
to pay the additional distribution described below and for general corporate
purposes, including opening new Shacks and renovating existing Shacks.
SSE Holdings will pay an additional distribution to certain of the Original SSE
Equity Owners from the gross proceeds of this offering in an amount equal to
approximately $6.8 million (or $11.1 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full).

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock in full, we estimate that our additional net proceeds will
be approximately $14.6 million. We will use the additional net proceeds we
receive pursuant to any exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase
additional shares of Class A common stock to purchase additional LLC Interests
from SSE Holdings to maintain the one-to-one ratio between the number of shares
of Class A common stock issued by us and the number of LLC Interests owned by
us. We intend to cause SSE Holdings to use the proceeds it receives (i) to pay
the additional distribution of $4.3 million described above and (ii) for general
corporate purposes, including opening new Shacks and renovating existing Shacks.

The Revolving Credit Facility matures in April 2019 and as of September 24,
2014, the interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility was 3.2% per annum."

(or approximately $35.4 million if the underwriters exercise in full their 
option to purchase additional shares) from the sale of the shares of common 
stock offered by us in this offering, excluding any proceeds from the concurrent
private placement, based on the initial public offering price of $10.00 per 
share, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We also expect to receive net 
proceeds of $4.6 million from the sale by us of shares of our common stock in
the concurrent private placement, for an aggregate amount to be raised by us in
this offering and the concurrent private placement of $35.0 million, based on
the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, and after deducting the
placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The private 
placement with NEA is contingent upon, and will occur concurrently with, the 
closing of this offering.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering as follows:

.  approximately $15.0 million to initiate manufacturing activities required 
   for regulatory approval;

.  approximately $9.0 million to initiate clinical activities for our 
   anticipated initial Phase 3 clinical trial of TRC105;

.  approximately $3.0 million to fund additional Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical 
   trials of TRC105 in large market oncology indications such as colorectal 
   cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma;

.  approximately $0.5 million to provide clinical supply of TRC102 for and to 
   provide support for NCI's conduct of our four anticipated Phase 1 or Phase 2 
   clinical trials of TRC102 in combination with chemotherapeutics; and

.  approximately $2.9 million to fund our preclinical studies of TRC205 in 
   non-cardiac and cardiac models of fibrosis and obtain the supply of TRC205 
   for our anticipated Phase 1 clinical trials (with the remaining amounts 
   needed for these activities to be funded by our anticipated proceeds from 
   the concurrent private placement as described below). 

Additionally, our existing cash will fund our obligations under our ongoing
Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Inlyta for renal cell
carcinoma and Votrient for soft tissue carcinoma. In addition, our existing cash
will fund our obligations under our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in
combination with Avastin for glioblastoma and our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial
of TRC105 in combination with Nexavar for hepatocellular carcinoma, which are
sponsored by NCI, and our three ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials of TRC102 in
combination with either Temodar or Fludara, which are sponsored by either NCI or
Case Western. We expect to use the net proceeds from the concurrent private
placement as follows: approximately $3.1 million to fund our preclinical studies
of TRC205 in non-cardiac and cardiac models of fibrosis and obtain the supply of
TRC205 for our anticipated Phase 1 clinical trials, and the remainder for
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including funding the
costs of operating as a public company. We believe that the net proceeds from
this offering and our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operations
for at least the next 18 months. In particular, we estimate that such funds and
the net proceeds from the concurrent private placement will be sufficient to
enable us to (1) complete our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of TRC105 for
renal cell carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and
glioblastoma, (2) obtain the supply of TRC105 and initiate clinical and
regulatory activities for our anticipated initial Phase 3 clinical trials of 
TRC105, (3) complete additional Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of TRC105 
in large market oncology indications, (4) complete our four anticipated Phase 
1 or Phase 2 clinical trials of TRC102 in combination with chemotherapeutics 
and (5) obtain the supply of TRC205 and initiate clinical trials in fibrosis.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placement represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and 
business condition. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with 
certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering 
and the concurrent private placement, or the amounts that we will actually 
spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual use of 
the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors, including the 
outcomes of our ongoing and planned clinical trials and the costs of our
research and development activities, as well as the amount of cash used in our
operations. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering and 
the concurrent private placement in short- and intermediate-term, 
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

this offering will be approximately $36.7 million, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriter exercises its option to subscribe for additional
ordinary shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately
$42.5 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $17.0 million to cover the total anticipated remaining costs 
  to advance our microlens and our microlens inserter through our U.S. staged
  pivotal clinical trial;  

. approximately $14.7 million to fund our efforts to expand the number of 
  high-volume refractive laser centers with which we do business;  

. approximately $4.0 million to fund research and development; and  

. approximately $1.0 million to pursue regulatory approvals that we require 
  in the United States and internationally.  

This calculation of net proceeds does not include $3,369,000 of offering costs
that we have expensed in our combined statement of operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2014.

Due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical trial and regulatory approval
process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net
proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. Our
management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this
offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the success of our clinical trials, the timing of regulatory
submissions and the amount of cash generated by our international sales.

to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing investment-grade

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

. $30.1 million to fund research and development efforts of our drug product 
  candidates for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps and spasms associated 
  with severe neuromuscular conditions; 

. $11.1 million for the sales and marketing efforts to launch our consumer 
  brand and products; and 

. the remainder to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, which

  technologies, compounds, other assets or complementary businesses. 

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could

candidates, technologies, compounds, other assets or complementary businesses,
we have no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so. Pending
these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash resources, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations through
2017, including through completion of at least one proof-of-concept study of our
proprietary treatment for individuals suffering from nocturnal leg cramps under
the dietary supplement regulatory framework in the United States, the continued
development of our pre-clinical drug product candidates, and the initiation of a
Phase 2 clinical trial and through the launch of our consumer brand and
cornerstone product. If the results of our proof-of-concept study of our
proprietary treatment are not favorable, we intend to pursue the development of
drug product candidates using the TRP activators in our proprietary treatment
for other indications where muscle cramps, spasms or abnormal muscle
contractions afflict patients. We have based this estimate on assumptions that
may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources
sooner than we currently expect."

exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the
above purposes. As such, our senior management will retain discretion over the
use of the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of any future
cash needs will depend upon numerous factors, including the timing of the
results of our ongoing Phase 2 trial of TransCon hGH, the timing of the receipt
of anticipated milestone payments from our existing collaboration partners, the
receipt of any up-front payments or milestone payments from any future
collaboration partners, the size, scope, timing and outcome of our ongoing and

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business condition. We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering and the
concurrent private placement or the amounts that we will actually spend on the
uses set forth above. Many variables are inherent in the development of our lead
product candidates at this time, such as the timing and results of preclinical
animal studies and clinical trials and the timing of regulatory submissions and
evolving regulatory requirements. The amount and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon such variables and we cannot currently predict the
stage of development we expect the net proceeds of this offering to achieve for
our clinical trials and product candidates.

As a result, we will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering and the concurrent private placement, and investors will be
relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this
offering and the concurrent private placement. In addition, we might decide to
postpone or not pursue certain clinical trials or preclinical activities if the
net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement and the
other sources of cash are less than expected."

new or secondhand vessels. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to

acquisition of vessels that we are able to identify. In addition, we may use all

offering at the initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses

underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility and create a public market for our Class A common stock.
We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for general
corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital
expenditures. While we cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of the
net proceeds we receive from this offering, we currently expect to invest at
least 50% of the net proceeds in sales and marketing activities, product
development, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures to
support the growth in our business. We also may use a portion of the net
proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, services or
technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any specific
acquisitions at this time. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the
net proceeds from this offering, provided that we comply with the terms and
conditions contained in our revolving line of credit facility. Pending the use
of proceeds from this offering as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing
securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial
paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

approximately $14.4 million, or approximately $17.0 million if the underwriters
elect to exercise in full their over-allotment option, based on the initial
public offering price of $15.75 per share and after deducting underwriting
discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering, in part, to provide capital
to support growth and expansion. We may also use the proceeds of the offering
to: (i) serve as a source of additional capital for the Bank, as it may require
from time to time; (ii) redeem SBLF Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock; (iii) enable the Company and the Bank to take advantage of strategic
opportunities as they may present themselves in the marketplace; and (iv)
provide additional working capital for the Company to service its ongoing
overhead and interest expense, and other ongoing operations of the Company. We
currently intend to redeem our SBLF Preferred Stock no later than the first
quarter of 2016, prior to the date on which the dividend rate on the SBLF
Preferred Stock will increase to 9.0%. Regardless of when we redeem our SBLF
Preferred Stock, it will cost us $15 million in redemption price, plus any
accrued or unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. Even without any net
proceeds from the sale of our common stock in this offering, we believe we
currently have sufficient capital to redeem the SBLF Preferred Stock. If we use
proceeds from this offering for other purposes as enumerated above, we
anticipate that we will still be able to redeem the SBLF Preferred Stock without
any of the costs or uncertainty associated with seeking to borrow funds or raise
capital in a separate, subsequent offering. We have not specifically allocated
the amount of net proceeds to us that will be used for these purposes and our
management will have broad discretion over how these proceeds are used. We are
conducting this offering at this time because we believe that it will allow us
to better execute our growth strategies.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the
selling shareholders. Messrs. Censky and Binversie, both founders and directors
of the Company and directors and executive officers of the Bank, will offer and
sell 58,500 and 87,750 shares of common stock, respectively, in our initial
public offering. Following the offering, Messrs. Censky and Binversie will own
6.8% and 5.7%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock.

We will not receive any proceeds from any sale of the SBLF Preferred Stock by
the U.S. Treasury."

from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us (or if the underwriters exercise in
full their over-allotment option, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds
of approximately $107.0 million). We will not receive any proceeds from the sale
of the shares by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings
under the senior secured credit facility or cash on hand, as follows:
(1) $66.8 million to repay all outstanding amounts under the amended and
restated first lien term loan agreement, dated as of August 6, 2014 (the
“PennantPark Loan Agreement”), between, among others, us and certain of our
subsidiaries, as borrowers, certain of our other subsidiaries and certain
affiliated entities, as guarantors, and PennantPark Investment Corporation and
certain of its affiliates, as lenders, comprising (i) an initial tranche (the
“Initial Tranche”) and (ii) an additional tranche (the “Additional Tranche”),
and (2) $56.6 million to repay all outstanding amounts under the credit
agreement, dated as of August 6, 2014 (the “UBS Credit Agreement”), between,
among others, us and certain of our subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto and
UBS Securities LLC, as lead arranger, bookmanager, documentation agent and
syndication agent, in each case including accrued interest and applicable
prepayment premiums.

As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately $66.5 million in outstanding
borrowings under our PennantPark Loan Agreement and $56.6 million in outstanding
borrowings under our UBS Credit Agreement. The borrowings under the Initial
Tranche of the PennantPark Loan Agreement were used primarily in connection with
the Reorganization, as described elsewhere in this prospectus. The borrowings
under the Additional Tranche of the PennantPark Loan Agreement and the UBS
Credit Agreement were used primarily in connection with the Acquisitions, as
described elsewhere in this prospectus. During the nine months ended September
30, 2014, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Acquisitions, outstanding
borrowings under our PennantPark Loan Agreement accrued interest at a weighted
average rate of 12.5% and outstanding borrowing under our UBS Credit Agreement
accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 10.0%. Our PennantPark Loan
Agreement requires quarterly amortizations with a final maturity on November 27,
2018. Amounts under our UBS Credit Agreement mature on August 6, 2019. UBS
Securities LLC is a lender under our UBS Credit Agreement and will receive a
portion of the proceeds of this offering. Accordingly, this offering is being
made in compliance with FINRA Rule 5121.

We plan to use the remaining net proceeds remaining after repayment of these 
borrowings for general corporate purposes, which, consistent with our growth 
strategy described elsewhere in this prospectus, may include possible 
acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses or other assets. While we 
routinely engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential 
acquisitions in the ordinary course of our business, we have no present 
understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or 
investments. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of 
remaining net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the treatment of these proceeds. 

In connection with the repayment of the existing debt, we expect to incur, as of
the closing of this offering, non-cash charges related to previously deferred
and unamortized debt issuance costs. Assuming we borrow under the senior secured
credit facility and repay the existing debt in full, we estimate that the
non-cash charge will be approximately $8.8 million."

(1)    A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
       FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
       portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we        
       received from Quinpario Partners LLC described below. These funds will be    
       repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.                 

(2)    The underwriting discount of 2.0% is payable at the closing of the offering. 
       As indicated elsewhere in this prospectus, certain members of our sponsor    
       and/or their affiliates have indicated that they may invest in the public    
       offering. If any of them do, the underwriters have agreed that we will       
       receive the entire aggregate gross proceeds from such purchases and the      
       underwriters will not receive any underwriting discounts or commissions on   
       such purchased units at the closing of the offering. Additionally, a deferred
       underwriting fee of 3.5% (including on any units purchased by members of our 
       sponsor and/or their affiliates) is payable upon consummation of our initial 
       business combination and will be held in the trust account until consummation
       of such business combination. No discounts or commissions will be paid with  
       respect to the purchase of the private warrants.                             

(3)    The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at 
       $1,300,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.                          

(4)    These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
       these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we  
       may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
       connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
       based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not   
       anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
       fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
       fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
       category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     

Our sponsor has committed that it and/or its designees will purchase the private
warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $9,000,000) from us on a private
placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Each
private warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one share of our
common stock at $5.75 per half share. Our sponsor and its designees have also
agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters, they
will purchase from us at a price of $0.50 per warrant an additional number of
private warrants (up to a maximum of 2,100,000 private warrants) pro rata with
the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least $10.00 per
share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless of whether
the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These additional private
warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously
with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment
option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in
the trust account described below. As described elsewhere in this prospectus,
the number of private warrants to be purchased by our sponsor and its designees
will be reduced to the extent that members of our sponsor and/or their
affiliates invest in the public offering because the underwriters have agreed
that we will receive the entire aggregate gross proceeds from any such purchases
and the discounts and commissions that we would have paid to the underwriters
for such purchased units at the closing of the offering will instead be placed
into the trust account.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $350,000,000, or $402,500,000 if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full, will be placed in an account in the United States
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. Pursuant
to the investment management trust agreement that will govern the investment of
such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will direct UBS
Financial Services to invest the funds as set forth in such written instructions
and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise instructed in
accordance with the investment management trust agreement. The funds held in the
trust account will be invested only in United States government treasury bills,
notes or bonds having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations,
the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption of 100% of
the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in
the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our
initial business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the 
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target 
business.

The payment to Quinpario Partners LLC, an affiliate of our sponsor, of a monthly
fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including office
space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Quinpario Partners LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide our
officers or directors with compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based
on rents and fees for similar services in St. Louis, Missouri, that the fee
charged by Quinpario Partners LLC is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no
compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, members of our management
team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine
their operations. Since the role of present management after our initial
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $1,300,000.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to
consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and
will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital
to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds 
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Quinpario Partners LLC has agreed to pay the
funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no
more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of September 12, 2014, our sponsor loaned to us an aggregate of $46,663 to be
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and
expenses. The loan is payable without interest on the earlier of (i) January 31,
2015, (ii) the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or (iii)
the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering.
The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for
payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our sponsor, officers and directors or their affiliates may,
but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a non-interest bearing promissory note. The notes would either
be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into additional private warrants
at a price of $0.50 per warrant. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of
the warrants and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the
extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of
our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business
combination, the loans will not be repaid.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination instead of
conducting a tender offer to allow our public stockholders to seek conversion of
their shares, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may
also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or
following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have
no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and
have not formulated any terms or conditions for such any transactions. If they
engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are
in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller
or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We
do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a
tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not complete a business combination that would cause our net tangible
assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s
“penny stock” rules). The agreement for our business combination, however, may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their conversion rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (1) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (2) if that public stockholder
elects to convert shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote
to approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity or (3) if that public
stockholder sells shares to us in any tender offer in connection with a proposed
initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

The Fund will use the proceeds from the sale of Baskets to purchase Coal Futures
to the greatest extent possible, without (i) being leveraged or unable to
satisfy its current or potential margin and/or collateral obligations with
respect to its investments, or (ii) exceeding relevant position limits. The Fund
also will purchase U.S. Treasuries for deposit with a Commodity Broker as margin
or to otherwise cover the Fund’s remaining notional exposure to Coal Futures.
 
All proceeds received from the sale of Baskets will be used to achieve the
Fund’s investment objective and to pay certain fees and expenses of the
Fund. The Fund will receive 100% of the interest income earned on its interest
bearing assets. The Sponsor will attempt to cause the Fund’s holdings to be
posted daily at www.greenhavenfunds.com after 5:00 p.m. New York time.
 
Investments in Coal Futures
 
Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment
objective by purchasing Coal Futures that are traded on the CME Facilities,
including smaller sized “mini” contracts (if they are available), to the
greatest extent possible, without being leveraged or exceeding relevant position
limits. The term “under normal market conditions” includes, but is not limited
to, the absence of extreme volatility or trading halts in the coal futures
markets or the financial markets generally; operational issues causing
dissemination of inaccurate market information; or force majeure events such as
systems failure, natural or man-made disaster, act of God, armed conflict, act
of terrorism, riot or labor disruption or any similar intervening
circumstance. The Fund will place purchase orders for Coal Futures with a
Commodity Broker. 

As the Fund initially plans to trade primarily on CME ClearPort, the Fund will
likely execute trades of Block Traded Coal Futures via CME ClearPort. The Fund
will place purchase orders for Block Traded Coal Futures with an Execution
Broker. The Execution Broker will identify a selling counterparty, and
simultaneously with completion of the transaction, the Block Traded Coal Futures
will be entered into CME ClearPort by the Execution Broker, thereby completing
the transaction and creating a cleared futures transaction. If the CME does not
accept the transaction for any reason, the transaction will be considered null
and void and of no legal effect. As a result, the Sponsor expects that all
Fund’s positions in Coal Futures, whether traded on the CME ClearPort Block
Trade entry systems (as initially planned) or on CME Globex (which may occur in
the future), will be cleared by CME clearing member firms, thereby minimizing
counterparty risk.
 
The Fund intends to hold the three month strip of the nearest calendar quarter
of Coal Futures contracts traded on the CME Facilities. The four calendar
quarters are January, February, and March (“Q1”); April, May, and June (“Q2”);
July, August, and September (“Q3”); and October, November, and December (“Q4”).
The Fund intends to invest in an equal amount of tonnage (equal number of
futures contracts) in each of the three months comprising the nearby calendar
quarter.

Four times a year, the Fund will attempt to roll its positions in the nearby
calendar quarter to the next calendar quarter over 5 business days on a pro-rata
basis. The first roll day is the 2nd Monday of the month prior to the nearby
calendar quarter. So for example, if the Fund was currently holding the Q1
calendar quarter it would roll over a 5 business day period starting on the 2nd
Monday in December. Each day during the roll period the Fund would decrease the
percentage of its portfolio that is in Q1 by 20% and increase its percentage in
Q2 by 20%.
 
The Fund may also realize interest income from its holdings in U.S. Treasuries,
which may be posted as margin or otherwise held to cover the Fund’s remaining
notional exposures to Coal Futures. The Sponsor will deposit a portion of the
Fund’s net assets with a Commodity Broker or other custodian to be used to meet
its current or potential margin or collateral requirements in connection with
its investment in Coal Futures. The Fund will use only U.S. Treasuries, cash 
and/or cash equivalents to satisfy these requirements. The Sponsor believes 
that all entities that will hold or trade the Fund’s assets will be based in 
the United States and will be subject to U.S. regulations. Up to 10% of the 
Fund’s assets are expected to be committed as margin and/or collateral for Coal 
Futures. However, from time to time, the percentage of assets committed as 
margin or collateral may be substantially more, or less, than 10%. The 
remaining portion of the Fund’s assets will be held in U.S. Treasuries, cash 
and/or cash equivalents by a Commodity Broker, in its capacity as the Fund’s 
custodian.
  
The Sponsor does not anticipate that the Fund’s Coal Futures positions will be
held until expiration, nor does the Sponsor expect the Fund to take or make
delivery of any physical commodities. Instead, the Sponsor expects to sell near
to expiry Coal Futures and reinvest the proceeds in new Coal Futures to achieve
the Fund’s investment objective. Positions may also be closed out to meet orders
for the redemption of Baskets, in which case the proceeds from closing the
positions will not be reinvested. The Sponsor is authorized by the Fund in its
sole judgment to employ, establish the terms of employment for, and terminate
commodity trading advisors or futures commission merchants of the Fund.
 
Margin; Composition of Portfolio
 
When the Fund purchases Coal Futures on the CME Facilities, the Fund will be
required to deposit a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as
security to ensure payment for the underlying obligation. This deposit is known
as initial margin.
 
For example, the purchase of a notional $10 million of Coal Futures traded on
the CME Facilities would require the Fund to make an initial margin deposit
representing only a fraction of the notional amount. The Fund would deposit the
required initial margin with a Commodity Broker in the form of a mix of cash and
U.S. Treasuries. Fund assets in an amount equal to the difference between the
initial margin and the notional value of the Coal Futures will be held in U.S.
Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in a segregated account with a
Commodity Broker and used to meet future margin payments, if any.
 
Although the allocations may vary substantially over time, as of the date of
this prospectus, the Sponsor estimates that:
 
.  approximately 10% of the NAV will be held as margin deposits in the form of
   U.S. Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in segregated accounts with a
   Commodity Broker, in accordance with the applicable CFTC rules; and  

.  approximately 90% of the NAV will be held to pay current obligations and as
   reserves in the form of U.S. Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in
   segregated accounts with a Commodity Broker.       

The Sponsor has the sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that
will be:
 
.  held as margin or collateral; and

.  held in U.S. Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents to pay current 
   obligations and as reserves.   

The assets deposited by the Fund with a Commodity Broker as margin must be
segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such segregated funds may 
be invested only in instruments approved by the CFTC, which include (i) U.S. 
government securities, (ii) municipal securities, (iii) U.S. agency obligations,
(iv) certificates of deposit, (v) commercial paper guaranteed by the U.S. 
government, (vi) corporate notes or bonds guaranteed by the U.S. government, 
and (vii) interests in money market mutual funds; however, the Sponsor 
anticipates that the Fund’s margin deposit assets will be invested only in U.S. 
Treasuries or otherwise held as cash and/or cash equivalents. Shareholders will 
not be required to post variation margin."

Margin; Composition of Portfolio
 
When the Fund purchases Coal Futures on the CME Facilities, the Fund will be
required to deposit a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as
security to ensure payment for the underlying obligation. This deposit is known
as initial margin.
 
For example, the purchase of a notional $10 million of Coal Futures traded on
the CME Facilities would require the Fund to make an initial margin deposit
representing only a fraction of the notional amount. The Fund would deposit the
required initial margin with a Commodity Broker in the form of a mix of cash and
U.S. Treasuries. Fund assets in an amount equal to the difference between the
initial margin and the notional value of the Coal Futures will be held in U.S.
Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in a segregated account with a
Commodity Broker and used to meet future margin payments, if any.
 
Although the allocations may vary substantially over time, as of the date of
this prospectus, the Sponsor estimates that:
 
.  approximately 10% of the NAV will be held as margin deposits in the form of
   U.S. Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in segregated accounts with a
   Commodity Broker, in accordance with the applicable CFTC rules; and  

.  approximately 90% of the NAV will be held to pay current obligations and as
   reserves in the form of U.S. Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents in
   segregated accounts with a Commodity Broker.       

The Sponsor has the sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that
will be:
 
.  held as margin or collateral; and

.  held in U.S. Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents to pay current 
   obligations and as reserves.   

The assets deposited by the Fund with a Commodity Broker as margin must be
segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such segregated funds may 
be invested only in instruments approved by the CFTC, which include (i) U.S. 
government securities, (ii) municipal securities, (iii) U.S. agency obligations,
(iv) certificates of deposit, (v) commercial paper guaranteed by the U.S. 
government, (vi) corporate notes or bonds guaranteed by the U.S. government, 
and (vii) interests in money market mutual funds; however, the Sponsor 
anticipates that the Fund’s margin deposit assets will be invested only in U.S. 
Treasuries or otherwise held as cash and/or cash equivalents. Shareholders will 
not be required to post variation margin."

The Fund will use the proceeds from the sale of Baskets to purchase Coal Futures
to the greatest extent possible, without (i) being leveraged or unable to
satisfy its current or potential margin and/or collateral obligations with
respect to its investments, or (ii) exceeding relevant position limits. The Fund
also will purchase U.S. Treasuries for deposit with a Commodity Broker as margin
or to otherwise cover the Fund’s remaining notional exposure to Coal Futures.
 
All proceeds received from the sale of Baskets will be used to achieve the
Fund’s investment objective and to pay certain fees and expenses of the
Fund. The Fund will receive 100% of the interest income earned on its interest
bearing assets. The Sponsor will attempt to cause the Fund’s holdings to be
posted daily at www.greenhavenfunds.com after 5:00 p.m. New York time.
 
Investments in Coal Futures
 
Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment
objective by purchasing Coal Futures that are traded on the CME Facilities,
including smaller sized “mini” contracts (if they are available), to the
greatest extent possible, without being leveraged or exceeding relevant position
limits. The term “under normal market conditions” includes, but is not limited
to, the absence of extreme volatility or trading halts in the coal futures
markets or the financial markets generally; operational issues causing
dissemination of inaccurate market information; or force majeure events such as
systems failure, natural or man-made disaster, act of God, armed conflict, act
of terrorism, riot or labor disruption or any similar intervening
circumstance. The Fund will place purchase orders for Coal Futures with a
Commodity Broker. 

As the Fund initially plans to trade primarily on CME ClearPort, the Fund will
likely execute trades of Block Traded Coal Futures via CME ClearPort. The Fund
will place purchase orders for Block Traded Coal Futures with an Execution
Broker. The Execution Broker will identify a selling counterparty, and
simultaneously with completion of the transaction, the Block Traded Coal Futures
will be entered into CME ClearPort by the Execution Broker, thereby completing
the transaction and creating a cleared futures transaction. If the CME does not
accept the transaction for any reason, the transaction will be considered null
and void and of no legal effect. As a result, the Sponsor expects that all
Fund’s positions in Coal Futures, whether traded on the CME ClearPort Block
Trade entry systems (as initially planned) or on CME Globex (which may occur in
the future), will be cleared by CME clearing member firms, thereby minimizing
counterparty risk.
 
The Fund intends to hold the three month strip of the nearest calendar quarter
of Coal Futures contracts traded on the CME Facilities. The four calendar
quarters are January, February, and March (“Q1”); April, May, and June (“Q2”);
July, August, and September (“Q3”); and October, November, and December (“Q4”).
The Fund intends to invest in an equal amount of tonnage (equal number of
futures contracts) in each of the three months comprising the nearby calendar
quarter.

Four times a year, the Fund will attempt to roll its positions in the nearby
calendar quarter to the next calendar quarter over 5 business days on a pro-rata
basis. The first roll day is the 2nd Monday of the month prior to the nearby
calendar quarter. So for example, if the Fund was currently holding the Q1
calendar quarter it would roll over a 5 business day period starting on the 2nd
Monday in December. Each day during the roll period the Fund would decrease the
percentage of its portfolio that is in Q1 by 20% and increase its percentage in
Q2 by 20%.
 
The Fund may also realize interest income from its holdings in U.S. Treasuries,
which may be posted as margin or otherwise held to cover the Fund’s remaining
notional exposures to Coal Futures. The Sponsor will deposit a portion of the
Fund’s net assets with a Commodity Broker or other custodian to be used to meet
its current or potential margin or collateral requirements in connection with
its investment in Coal Futures. The Fund will use only U.S. Treasuries, cash 
and/or cash equivalents to satisfy these requirements. The Sponsor believes 
that all entities that will hold or trade the Fund’s assets will be based in 
the United States and will be subject to U.S. regulations. Up to 10% of the 
Fund’s assets are expected to be committed as margin and/or collateral for Coal 
Futures. However, from time to time, the percentage of assets committed as 
margin or collateral may be substantially more, or less, than 10%. The 
remaining portion of the Fund’s assets will be held in U.S. Treasuries, cash 
and/or cash equivalents by a Commodity Broker, in its capacity as the Fund’s 
custodian.
  
The Sponsor does not anticipate that the Fund’s Coal Futures positions will be
held until expiration, nor does the Sponsor expect the Fund to take or make
delivery of any physical commodities. Instead, the Sponsor expects to sell near
to expiry Coal Futures and reinvest the proceeds in new Coal Futures to achieve
the Fund’s investment objective. Positions may also be closed out to meet orders
for the redemption of Baskets, in which case the proceeds from closing the
positions will not be reinvested. The Sponsor is authorized by the Fund in its
sole judgment to employ, establish the terms of employment for, and terminate
commodity trading advisors or futures commission merchants of the Fund.

common stock in this offering will be approximately $35.0 million based upon the
initial public offering price of $6.00 per share, and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ exercise their overallotment option, we estimate
that our net proceeds will be approximately $40.5 million, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the concurrent offering of notes,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $18.6 million. If the
underwriters for the concurrent offering of notes exercise their overallotment
option, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $21.4 million,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of both offerings are to fund the continued testing of
trabodenoson as a monotherapy and as a fixed-dose combination with latanoprost
for the reduction of intraocular pressure, or IOP, fund the further increase of
our financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock,
facilitate our access to the public equity markets and for general corporate
purposes. We currently expect to use the net proceeds from both offerings as
follows:

. approximately $17.0 million to complete the first Phase 3 pivotal trial for 
  trabodenoson monotherapy, including associated payments for direct clinical 
  and non-clinical costs;  

. approximately $9.0 million to complete a Phase 2 trial for our FDC product 
  candidate, including associated payments for direct clinical and non-clinical 
  costs, and the development of a commercial formulation;  

. approximately $6.0 million to fund proof-of-concept clinical trials for 
  optic neuropathies and degenerative retinal diseases, including associated 
  payments for direct clinical and non-clinical costs;  

. approximately $6.0 million to repay borrowings under and terminate our 
  existing notes payable agreements with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation 
  and Fortress Credit Co LLC; and  

. the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.  

We intend to repay borrowings under and terminate our existing notes payable
agreements with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation and Fortress Credit Co
LLC with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. The notes payable
bear interest at a rate of 11.0% per annum and mature on October 1, 2016. As of
September 30, 2014, the total principal balance owed under the notes payable
agreements was $6.3 million.

Our expected use of net proceeds from both offerings represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of both offerings or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. We may use a
portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the acquisition or licensing,
as the case may be, of additional technologies, other assets or businesses, or
for other strategic investments or opportunities, although we have no current
understandings, agreements or commitments to do so at this time.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the results of our continued testing of our product 
candidates and other factors. For example, the ultimate cost of the Phase 3

common stock in this offering will be approximately $35.0 million based upon the
initial public offering price of $6.00 per share, and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ exercise their overallotment option, we estimate
that our net proceeds will be approximately $40.5 million, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the concurrent offering of notes,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $18.6 million. If the
underwriters for the concurrent offering of notes exercise their overallotment
option, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $21.4 million,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of both offerings are to fund the continued testing of
trabodenoson as a monotherapy and as a fixed-dose combination with latanoprost
for the reduction of intraocular pressure, or IOP, fund the further increase of
our financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock,
facilitate our access to the public equity markets and for general corporate
purposes. We currently expect to use the net proceeds from both offerings as
follows:

. approximately $17.0 million to complete the first Phase 3 pivotal trial for 
  trabodenoson monotherapy, including associated payments for direct clinical 
  and non-clinical costs;  

. approximately $9.0 million to complete a Phase 2 trial for our FDC product 
  candidate, including associated payments for direct clinical and non-clinical 
  costs, and the development of a commercial formulation;  

. approximately $6.0 million to fund proof-of-concept clinical trials for 
  optic neuropathies and degenerative retinal diseases, including associated 
  payments for direct clinical and non-clinical costs;  

. approximately $6.0 million to repay borrowings under and terminate our 
  existing notes payable agreements with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation 
  and Fortress Credit Co LLC; and  

. the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.  

We intend to repay borrowings under and terminate our existing notes payable
agreements with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation and Fortress Credit Co
LLC with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. The notes payable
bear interest at a rate of 11.0% per annum and mature on October 1, 2016. As of
September 30, 2014, the total principal balance owed under the notes payable
agreements was $6.3 million.

Our expected use of net proceeds from both offerings represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of both offerings or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. We may use a
portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the acquisition or licensing,
as the case may be, of additional technologies, other assets or businesses, or
for other strategic investments or opportunities, although we have no current
understandings, agreements or commitments to do so at this time.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the results of our continued testing of our product 
candidates and other factors. For example, the ultimate cost of the Phase 3 
trials will depend on trial designs that must be confirmed with the FDA and 
can vary significantly. Accordingly, our management will have flexibility in 
applying the net proceeds from both offerings. An investor will not have the 
opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which 
we base our decisions on how to use the proceeds. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high quality, 
investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed 
obligations of the U.S. government, or hold as cash."

offering will be approximately $2.7 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $6.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares in this offering is exercised
in full, we estimate our net proceeds will be approximately $3.3 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, create a public market for our common stock, facilitate
our future access to the public equity markets and increase our visibility in
our markets. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

   •   approximately $1.7 million to fund, through completion, a dose curve trial 
       for back-of-the-eye delivery and a macular edema Phase 2 proof-of-concept  
       trial using the EGP-437 Combination Product; and                           

   •   the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,    
       which will include the pursuit of our other research and discovery efforts 
       and could also include the acquisition or in-license of other products,    
       product candidates or technologies.                                        

Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade
securities or certificates of deposit.

We believe that the expected net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to
fund our operations through the end of 2015, although we cannot assure you that
this will occur.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials, as well as the amount of
cash used in our operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the
net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of
our management regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering."

(1) As of the date of this prospectus, $95,294 of these expenses have been paid
    from the proceeds loans made to us by our sponsor. These loans by our      
    sponsor will be repaid upon the earlier of the completion of this offering 
    or March 31, 2015. If offering expenses actually paid are less than the    
    estimates set forth in this table, the balance will be used for            
    post-closing working capital.                                              

(2) Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed to defer until consummation of our initial    
    business combination $5.0 million of their underwriting commissions (or    
    $6.05 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised       
    in full), which equals 5.0% of the gross proceeds from the units sold to   
    the public, excluding any units purchased pursuant to the underwriters’    
    overallotment option, and 7.0% of the gross proceeds from the units sold to
    the public pursuant to the underwriters’ overallotment option. Upon        
    consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters’        
    deferred commissions will be paid to Cantor Fitzgerald from the funds held 
    in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and   
    can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business  
    or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for    
    general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on  
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, 
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital.           

(3) $100.0 million from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement
    ($115.0 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in 
    full), including deferred underwriting commissions of $5.0 million ($6.05  
    million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full),  
    will be placed in a trust account held at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,       
    located in the United States, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust      
    Company, acting as trustee.                                                

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current        
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business        
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business            
    combination. If we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry   
    subject to industry specific regulation, we may incur additional expenses  
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal    
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary, and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due      
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any    
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.    

(5) To the extent that we need working capital in excess of the net proceeds   
    from this offering and the private placement held out of trust and the     
    amounts of interest available to us from the trust account, our sponsor has
    committed to lend us the necessary funds, up to a maximum of $750,000. The 
    loans will be interest free, due and payable upon completion of our initial
    business combination and convertible into warrants of the post business    
    combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the    
    lender.

A total of $100.0 million (or $115.0 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the aggregate net proceeds from this offering
and the private placement, including $5.0 million (or $6.05 million if the
underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full) of the deferred
underwriting discount, will be placed in a trust account with Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in United
States government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds investing solely in United States Treasuries and meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for any
interest income released to us for working capital purposes or the payment of
taxes or dissolution expenses, none of the funds held in the trust account will
be released, subject to the requirements of law, until the earlier of (i) the
consummation of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of our
public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 18
months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ overallotment option), subject to applicable law; or (iii)
otherwise upon our liquidation or if our board of directors resolves to
liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business
combination prior to the expiration of the 18 month period (our board of
directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration
if it determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the
remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or satisfy
regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business
combination).

The net proceeds held in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting
commissions) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. If we pay 
for our initial business combination using stock or debt securities, or if we 
do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the 
purchase price in connection with our business combination, we may use the 
remaining cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of the operations of acquired businesses,
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital. 

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement
held out of trust, interest income on the amount in the trust account that may
be released to fund working capital requirements and amounts which our sponsor
has committed to lend to us for working capital prior to our initial business
combination will be sufficient to pay our costs and expenses prior to our
initial business combination. This belief is based on the fact that while we may
begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an
indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending
on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that
addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us. In addition, if we increase or decrease the
size of this offering, it would result in a proportionate increase or decrease
in the amount of interest earned in the trust account and available to us. While
we currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and
while they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, we
believe that any additional interest income earned would facilitate our ability
to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater number of potential
acquisition targets.

Our sponsor, FinTech Investor Holdings, LLC, has committed to loan us up to an
aggregate of $500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering
($95,294 of which has been loaned as of the date of this prospectus). These
loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of March 31,
2015 or the completion of this offering. In addition, in order to fund
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination,
our sponsor has committed to loan us funds as may be required up to a maximum of
$750,000, which will be repaid only upon the consummation of an initial business
combination. If we do not consummate an initial business combination, we may use
a portion of any working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
loaned amounts; however, no proceeds from the trust account may be used for such
repayment, other than interest income earned thereon. If such funds are
insufficient to repay the loan amounts, the unpaid amounts would be forgiven.
Any part or all of such loans may be converted into additional warrants at $0.75
per warrant (a maximum of 1,000,000 warrants if the full $750,000 is loaned and
that amount is converted into warrants) of the post-business combination entity
at the option of our sponsor. The warrants would be identical to the placement
warrants issued to our sponsor.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. We
anticipate that our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities
that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption of their
shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in direct
negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions. All holders approached
in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There is no
limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our initial holders, directors,
officers or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act or in
transaction which would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the
Exchange Act. Although they do not currently anticipate paying any premium
purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the price they may
pay. We will notify stockholders of such purchases, if any, by press release,
filing a Form 8-K or by means of a supplement to our proxy statement.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Moreover, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. If the amount of redemptions plus any cash required by our
initial business combination would cause our net tangible assets to fall below
$5,000,000, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the
business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 18 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option),
subject to applicable law; or (iii) otherwise upon our liquidation or in the
event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases
to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of
the 18 month period (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust
account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment,
that it is improbable within the remaining time that we will be able to identify
an attractive acquisition target or satisfy regulatory and other business and
legal requirements to consummate a business combination). In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

The initial holders and Cantor Fitzgerald have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares (i) in
connection with the consummation of a business combination and (ii) if we fail
to consummate a business combination within 18 months from the completion of
this offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option)
or if we liquidate prior to the expiration of the 18 month period. The initial
holders have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to public
shares in connection with the consummation of a business combination. However,
if the initial holders, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates,
acquires public shares, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect
to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination
or liquidate within the required time period, and Cantor Fitzgerald will have
the same redemption rights as a public stockholder with respect to any public
shares it acquires."

by us of approximately $2.2 million. We expect to contribute substantially all
of these net proceeds to our operating partnership to acquire mortgage-related
assets as described in this prospectus.

(1) As of date of acquisition
 
We have not entered into binding definitive commitments relating to these
mortgage loans. We and our Manager are conducting a diligence review of these
loans and, as a result, the terms of acquisition may change prior to closing. We
anticipate that we will deploy the remaining net proceeds of this offering
following the completion of this offering to acquire non-performing and
re-performing mortgage loans having characteristics substantially similar to
those comprising our loan portfolio, subject to the availability of appropriate
investment opportunities consistent with our objectives.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
readily marketable, interest bearing, short-term investment grade securities or
money market accounts that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a
REIT. Such temporary investments are expected to provide a lower net return than
we anticipate achieving from our targeted investments.

Although we do not intend to use any of the net proceeds from this offering to
fund distributions to our stockholders, to the extent we use the net proceeds to
fund distributions, these payments may be treated as a return of capital to our
stockholders.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the
selling stockholders."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $52.6 million,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to 
purchase additional shares, we estimate that the net proceeds from this 
offering will be approximately $61.0 million.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as 
follows:

. approximately $45 million to fund our planned Phase 3 clinical development 
  of INOpulse for PAH; and

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, 
cash equivalents and restricted cash represents our intentions based upon our 
current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual 
expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including 
the progress of our development and commercialization efforts, the status of 
and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may 
enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen 
cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the 
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

As of September 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $30.6 million 
and restricted cash of $13.1 million. Based on our planned use of the net 
proceeds from this offering described above, we estimate that such funds, 
together with our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete our ongoing clinical trial for BCM, to 
fund the first trial in our planned Phase 3 clinical development of INOpulse 
for PAH and to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure 
requirements at least into mid-2016. We have based this estimate on assumptions 
that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources 
sooner than we currently expect. We do not expect that the net proceeds from 
this offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash will 
be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development and 
commercialization of any of our product candidates.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

this offering will be approximately $91.4 million, based on the initial public
offering price, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters' option to
purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full, we estimate that we
will receive additional net proceeds of $14.2 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, increase our visibility in the marketplace, establish a
public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to the
public capital markets. We currently intend to use the proceeds from this
offering as follows:

. between approximately $24.0 million and $28.0 million for research and 
  development, including assay development, software development for our 
  analysis pipeline and our clinical report optimization platform, or CROP; 

. between approximately $23.0 million and $27.0 million for selling and 
  marketing activities, including development and operation of our web site 
  for taking and delivering customer orders, hiring sales, customer service 
  and marketing personnel, and marketing programs, including attendance at 
  conferences; 

. between approximately $4.0 million and $6.0 million for capital expenditures, 
  including investment in additional laboratory capacity, sample preparation 
  and sequencing equipment and computer systems for generating, analyzing and 
  storing genetic information; and 

. the remainder for corporate and administrative expenses (including personnel-
  related costs and costs associated with operating as a public company), and 
  for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering described above
represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors,
including competitive and technological developments, the number of billable
tests we perform, our success in obtaining reimbursement, our ability to lower
the costs associated with performing our tests, the amount of cash generated by
our operations, the timing and amount of investments in our business, demand for
tests with expanded genetic content, demand for enhancement of our analysis
pipeline and CROP to service greater assay volume potentially at reduced
turnaround times, utilization of our website for taking and delivering customer
orders, the need for sales, customer service and marketing personnel to drive
demand and address customer requirements, and the need for increased amounts of
laboratory capacity, sample preparation and sequencing equipment and computer
systems for generating, analyzing and storing genetic information. If our
development of additional assays or systems requires more resources than we
anticipate, we may allocate additional proceeds from this offering to our
research and development activities. If market acceptance of and reimbursement
for our assays is slower than we anticipate, we may reallocate a portion of the
proceeds from research and development and capital expenditures to selling and
marketing activities.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to license,
acquire or invest in complementary business, technologies, products or assets.
However, we have no current plans, commitments or obligations to do so.
Accordingly, our management team will have broad discretion in using the net
proceeds to be received by us from this offering. Pending the use of proceeds
from this offering as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and estimated offering

The principal purposes of our initial public offering are to create a public 
market for our Class A common stock and thereby enable future access to the

such opportunities arise, and to maintain our capital and liquidity ratios, and
the ratios of our bank, at acceptable levels. Although we may, from time to
time, evaluate potential acquisitions, we do not have any arrangements,
agreements or understandings relating to any acquisitions at the current time,
and we are not engaged in any negotiations to make any acquisitions. Other than
net proceeds used to redeem our Series C Preferred Stock, we have not
specifically allocated the amount of net proceeds to us that will be used for
these purposes, and our management will have broad discretion over how these
proceeds are used. Our Series C Preferred Stock is currently redeemable by us,
at our option, upon no less than 30 days and no more than 60 days’ notice to
Treasury, which notice we have provided to Treasury. No premium is attached to
such redemption. Such redemption would require approval of our banking
regulators which approval has not yet been sought.

Proceeds held by us will be invested in short term investments until needed for
the uses described above.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the
selling stockholders."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we       
    received from our sponsors described below. These funds will be repaid out  
    of the proceeds of this offering available to us.                           

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.                                    

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at
    $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest     
    income earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of    
    taxes owed on such interest income) in an amount up to $500,000 will be     
    available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. We estimate the
    interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $40,800 over a   
    24-month period assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.05% per year.  

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial        
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business    
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of         
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated 
    expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates   
    for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess    
    working capital.                                                            

Our sponsors and EarlyBirdCapital have committed that they and/or their
designees will purchase the private units (for an aggregate purchase price of
$2,950,000) from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the
consummation of this offering. The foregoing purchases will only be made by our
sponsors and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) if they are able to do so
in accordance with Regulation M and Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of
the Exchange Act. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be
placed in the trust account described below.

$40,800,000, or $46,620,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds
held in the trust account will be invested only in United States government
treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S.
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (1) interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other
tax obligations and (2) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
that may be released to us for our working capital requirements, the proceeds
will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion
of our initial business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding
public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required
time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial
business combination to the extent not used to pay converting stockholders. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Barington Capital Group, L.P., an affiliate of James A.
Mitarotonda, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and administrative support. This
arrangement is being agreed to by Barington Capital Group, L.P. for our benefit
and is not intended to provide Mr. Mitarotonda with compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in New York
City, that the fee charged by Barington Capital Group, L.P. is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination
or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than
the $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and
consulting fees or other similar compensation) will be paid to our sponsors,
members of our management team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after our
initial business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $500,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) up to
$500,000 may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in
searching for our initial business combination. We intend to use the after-tax
interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to
assist us with our search for a target business and for director and officer
liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the
event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsors, officers
and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available to us from the trust account is insufficient as a result of
the current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to
EarlyBirdCapital in an amount equal to 4.00% of the total gross proceeds raised
in the offering upon consummation of our initial business combination for
assisting us in connection with our initial business combination (but not for
the purpose of identifying a target business). To the extent that our capital
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial
business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used
to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company
and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing,
research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, affiliates of Barington Capital Group, L. P. and
Hilco Global have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation
(in an amount not to exceed $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of October 22, 2014, affiliates of Barington Capital Group, L. P. and Hilco
Global loaned to us an aggregate of $120,000 to be used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans
are payable without interest on the earlier of (i) September 29, 2015, (ii) the
date on which we consummate our initial public offering or (iii) the date on
which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering. The loan
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment
of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time and the period
of time to complete a business combination has been extended in full. However,
if necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the
consummation of this offering, our sponsors, officers and directors may, but are
not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be
evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation
of the offering, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to
$500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business
combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, 
for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000 shares of common 
stock if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 rights included 
in the private units would result in the issuance of 5,000 shares of common 
stock upon the closing of our business combination as well as 50,000 warrants 
to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock).

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (1) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period or (2) if that public
stockholder elects to convert shares of common stock in connection with a
stockholder vote. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

from this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount, the
structuring fee of $7.4 million paid to Barclays Capital Inc. and Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., and offering expenses, to purchase an additional
approximate 7.3% limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo. The approximate 7.3%
interest in Columbia OpCo purchased with the proceeds from this offering, when
combined with an approximate 7.3% interest in Columbia OpCo contributed to us in
connection with the formation transactions, will result in our ownership of a
14.6% limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo following the closing of the
offering.

Columbia OpCo will use $500.0 million of the net proceeds it receives from us to
make a distribution to CEG as a reimbursement of preformation capital
expenditures with respect to the assets contributed to Columbia OpCo and the
remaining proceeds it receives from us to fund expansion capital expenditures.
We would expect the remaining net proceeds of $515.8 million to be completely
utilized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, for these purposes.

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 7,021,709 additional
common units in full, the additional net proceeds would be approximately $153.4
million. The net proceeds from any exercise of such option will be used to
purchase an additional percentage limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo, and
Columbia OpCo will use such cash to fund growth projects and for general
partnership purposes. The amount of the additional interest in Columbia OpCo
purchased will depend on the number of common units issued pursuant to the
exercise of such option, and will be calculated at approximately 0.16%
additional limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo purchased for each
one million of additional common units purchased by the underwriters. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units in full,
we would purchase an additional 1.1% limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo
and our total ownership interest in Columbia OpCo would be 15.7%."

approximately $180.0 million, or approximately $207.0 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full. After deducting the
underwriting discount and commissions and estimated offering expenses of
approximately $13.5 million, we expect to receive net proceeds from this
offering of approximately $166.5 million, or approximately $191.7 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full. In addition,
concurrently with the completion of this offering, we will issue
7,033,712 shares of common stock to the Easterly Funds in the concurrent private
placement at the public offering price without payment of any underwriting fees,
discounts or commissions. We expect to receive proceeds from the concurrent
private placement of approximately $105.5 million.

We will contribute the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement to our operating partnership in exchange for common units. We
expect our operating partnership to use the net proceeds received from us and a
portion of the borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility
to repay $272.9 million in outstanding indebtedness and any applicable repayment
costs, defeasance costs, settlement of interest rate swap liabilities and other
costs and fees associated with such repayments and $1.1 million of costs related
to our acquisition of Western Devcon. Exact payment amounts may differ from
estimates due to amortization of principal, additional borrowings and incurrence
of additional transaction expenses.

The following table describes the mortgage indebtedness that we intend to repay
with the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement

facility at the closing of this offering.

shares in this offering will be approximately $34.4 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $10.00 per ordinary share, after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate the net
proceeds to us will be approximately $39.9 million, after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to complete the clinical
development and chemistry, manufacturing and controls development of each of our
lead product candidates as follows:

. $4.0 million to complete our pivotal safety and efficacy studies for NV-01, 
  our lead product candidate for the control of pain associated with 
  osteoarthritis in dogs, plus an additional $9.0 million for chemistry, 
  manufacturing and controls studies ($5.0 million), stability studies ($2.0 
  million), and regulatory compliance and other miscellaneous costs ($2.0 
  million); and  

. $13.0 to $15.0 million to complete the development and manufacturing scale-up 
  of each of NV-02, our lead product candidate for the control of pain 
  associated with degenerative joint disease in cats, and NV-08, our lead 
  product candidate for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, 
  including atopic dermatitis, in dogs, which includes for each lead product 
  candidate pivotal safety and efficacy studies ($4.0 million), chemistry, 
  manufacturing and controls studies ($4.0 to $5.0 million), stability studies 
  ($2.0 million), costs for proof-of-concept related activities ($1.0 million) 
  and regulatory compliance and other miscellaneous costs ($2.0 to $3.0 
  million).  

Our estimates to complete development of NV-01, NV-02 and NV-08 are preliminary.
Total costs to develop each lead product candidate will depend on, among other
factors, the potency and yield of the selected cell lines, costs associated with
increasing the batch size to commercial levels and to meet regulatory
obligations, costs associated with gathering and responding to information
obtained in proof-of-concept studies and costs associated with the number of
animals enrolled in and the duration of pivotal safety and efficacy studies. We
do not expect that amounts spent to develop any one product candidate will
significantly overlap with or reduce the costs to develop any other product
candidate.

We intend to fund research activities to develop our pipeline of other product
candidates in an amount of $6.0 to $7.0 million per year. Assuming one or more
of our lead product candidates is approved for marketing, we intend to establish
our sales force infrastructure in the United States. We intend to use the
remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general
corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or
in-license additional product candidates or complementary assets or businesses;
however, we currently have no agreements, commitments or understandings to
complete any such transaction.

Other than as set forth above, we have not yet identified the amounts we intend
to spend on each of these areas or the timing of the expenditures. The expected
uses of the net proceeds from this offering represent our intentions based on
our current plans and business conditions and are approximations. Our actual use
of these proceeds may differ substantially from our current intentions. The
timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations, the anticipated growth of our business and
any future acquisitions that we may propose. Accordingly, our management will
have broad discretion regarding the use of the net proceeds from this offering,
and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of the net proceeds in this offering. Pending these uses, we intend
to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest bearing,
investment-grade securities. We cannot predict whether these investments will
yield a favorable return."

of approximately $7.0 million (or approximately $8.1 million if the

We intend to use substantially all of such net proceeds from this offering and 
the concurrent private placement to fund the loans identified and described as 
our Initial Portfolio in this prospectus. The Initial Portfolio consists of 15 
loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $122.7 million. 
Accordingly, we may need to borrow funds or raise additional equity capital to 
fund the Initial Portfolio in full. We have engaged in discussions with 
potential lenders with respect to establishing a credit facility. We expect to 
establish a credit facility with a commercial bank after the consummation of 
this offering on terms that are generally consistent with current market terms 
and conditions. The majority of the loans in the Initial Portfolio are 
Development Loans. We anticipate Development Loans to fund 30-40% at loan 
origination, with the balance typically funded over the following six to 12 
months pursuant to a draw schedule.

Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering in accordance with the 
foregoing intent, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
interest-bearing short-term investments, including money market accounts that 
are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. These investments are

net proceeds to the Bank as regulatory capital. The precise amounts and timing 
of our use of the proceeds will depend upon market conditions and other 
factors.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common

estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering

  immuno-oncology product candidates, which we believe will be sufficient to 
  progress each of UCART19, UCART123, UCARTCS1 and UCART38 through phase 1 
  clinical trials and to commence phase 2 clinical trials on one or more of 
  these product candidates;

. approximately $30 million for further research and development regarding cell 
  attributes and to develop our manufacturing processes and cell engineering 
  technologies;

. approximately $30 million to pursue new human therapeutics outside of 
  oncology;

. approximately $33 million to advance our agricultural biotechnology business; 
  and

. the remainder, if any, for working capital and other general corporate 
  purposes.

We currently have no specific plans as to how the net proceeds from this 
offering will be allocated beyond the expected uses specified above and 
therefore management will retain discretion with respect to the use of the 
remainder of the net proceeds of this offering. We may also use a portion of 
the net proceeds to acquire, license or invest in complementary products, 
technologies or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or 
commitments to complete any such transaction.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date 
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses 
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the 
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts 
and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development 
may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress 
of our development efforts, the status of and results from pre-clinical studies 
and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the 
future, as well as any strategic alliances that we may enter into with third 
parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, 
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and 
    a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    received from Eric S. Rosenfeld described below. These funds will be 
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.  

(2) The underwriting discount of 2.0% is payable at the closing of the offering 
    (excluding proceeds received from the exercise of the over-allotment option, 
    on which we will not pay any upfront underwriting discount). Additionally, 
    a deferred underwriting fee of up to 3.5% (5.5% on any proceeds received 
    from the exercise of the over-allotment option) is payable upon consummation 
    of our initial business combination and will be held in the trust account 
    until consummation of such business combination. No discounts or commissions 
    will be paid with respect to the purchase of the private units.  

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $650,000 
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income 
    earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us to 
    pay for our income and other tax obligations. We estimate the interest 
    earned on the trust account will be approximately $150,000 over a 24-month 
    period assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.075% per year.  

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not 
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.  

Our initial stockholders and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (or its designees) have
committed to purchase from us an aggregate of 528,500 private units at $10.00
per unit (for a total purchase price of $5,285,000). These purchases will take
place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this
offering. Our initial stockholders have also agreed that if the over-allotment
option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they will purchase
from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of private units (up to a
maximum of 30,000 private units) that is necessary to maintain in the trust
account an amount equal to $10.20 per share of common stock sold to the public
in this offering. The foregoing purchases will only be made by our initial
stockholders and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (or its designees) if they are able to
do so in accordance with Regulation M and Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Rule
10b-5 of the Exchange Act. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account.

In addition, Eric S. Rosenfeld, our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to enter
into an agreement in accordance with the guidelines of Rule 10b5-1 of the
Exchange Act pursuant to which he will place limit orders for an aggregate of up
to $500,000 of our common stock during the time periods and subject to the
conditions described elsewhere in this prospectus.

$102,000,000, or $117,300,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account in the United States maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Pursuant to the
investment management trust agreement that will govern the investment of such
funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will direct UBS Financial
Services to invest the funds as set forth in such written instructions and to
custody the funds while invested and until otherwise instructed in accordance
with the investment management trust agreement. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes having
a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
and that invest solely in United States government treasuries, so that we are
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except
with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may
be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

The payment to Crescendo Advisors II, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr.
Rosenfeld, of a monthly fee of $12,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and administrative support. This
arrangement is being agreed to by Crescendo Advisors II, LLC for our benefit and
is not intended to provide Mr. Rosenfeld or our other executive officers with 
compensation in lieu of salaries. We believe, based on rents and fees for 
similar services in New York City, that the fee charged by Crescendo Advisors 
II, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated 
person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business 
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders.
Other than the $12,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including 
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing 
officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates prior to, or for 
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the 
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as 
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on 
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to 
and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target 
businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present management 
after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$650,000. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial stockholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our share capital is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Eric S. Rosenfeld has agreed
to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of December 31, 2014, Eric S. Rosenfeld loaned to us an aggregate of $50,000
to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and
expenses. The loan is payable without interest on the earlier of (i) May 31,
2015, (ii) the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or (iii)
the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering.
The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for
payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our initial stockholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but
are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the
units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the
holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial
business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination,
the loans would not be repaid.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination
within the required time period or (ii) if that public stockholder converts such
shares in connection with a business combination which we consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and 
    a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    received from Eric S. Rosenfeld described below. These funds will be 
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.  

(2) The underwriting discount of 2.0% is payable at the closing of the offering 
    (excluding proceeds received from the exercise of the over-allotment option, 
    on which we will not pay any upfront underwriting discount). Additionally, 
    a deferred underwriting fee of up to 3.5% (5.5% on any proceeds received 
    from the exercise of the over-allotment option) is payable upon consummation 
    of our initial business combination and will be held in the trust account 
    until consummation of such business combination. No discounts or commissions 
    will be paid with respect to the purchase of the private units.  

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $650,000 
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income 
    earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us to 
    pay for our income and other tax obligations. We estimate the interest 
    earned on the trust account will be approximately $150,000 over a 24-month 
    period assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.075% per year.  

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not 
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.  

Our initial stockholders and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (or its designees) have
committed to purchase from us an aggregate of 528,500 private units at $10.00
per unit (for a total purchase price of $5,285,000). These purchases will take
place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this
offering. Our initial stockholders have also agreed that if the over-allotment
option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they will purchase
from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of private units (up to a
maximum of 30,000 private units) that is necessary to maintain in the trust
account an amount equal to $10.20 per share of common stock sold to the public
in this offering. The foregoing purchases will only be made by our initial
stockholders and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (or its designees) if they are able to
do so in accordance with Regulation M and Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Rule
10b-5 of the Exchange Act. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account.

In addition, Eric S. Rosenfeld, our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to enter
into an agreement in accordance with the guidelines of Rule 10b5-1 of the
Exchange Act pursuant to which he will place limit orders for an aggregate of up
to $500,000 of our common stock during the time periods and subject to the
conditions described elsewhere in this prospectus.

$102,000,000, or $117,300,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account in the United States maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Pursuant to the
investment management trust agreement that will govern the investment of such
funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will direct UBS Financial
Services to invest the funds as set forth in such written instructions and to
custody the funds while invested and until otherwise instructed in accordance
with the investment management trust agreement. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes having
a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
and that invest solely in United States government treasuries, so that we are
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except
with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may
be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

The payment to Crescendo Advisors II, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr.
Rosenfeld, of a monthly fee of $12,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and administrative support. This
arrangement is being agreed to by Crescendo Advisors II, LLC for our benefit and
is not intended to provide Mr. Rosenfeld or our other executive officers with 
compensation in lieu of salaries. We believe, based on rents and fees for 
similar services in New York City, that the fee charged by Crescendo Advisors 
II, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated 
person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business 
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders.
Other than the $12,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including 
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing 
officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates prior to, or for 
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the 
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as 
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on 
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to 
and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target 
businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present management 
after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$650,000. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial stockholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our share capital is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Eric S. Rosenfeld has agreed
to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of December 31, 2014, Eric S. Rosenfeld loaned to us an aggregate of $50,000
to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and
expenses. The loan is payable without interest on the earlier of (i) May 31,
2015, (ii) the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or (iii)
the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering.
The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for
payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our initial stockholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but
are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the
units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the
holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial
business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination,
the loans would not be repaid.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination
within the required time period or (ii) if that public stockholder converts such
shares in connection with a business combination which we consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account."
TANTECH HOLDINGS LTD,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tantech-holdings-ltd-944893-76487,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tantech-holdings-ltd-944893-76487,424B1,3/27/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10590271,"After deducting the estimated placement discount and offering expenses payable
by us, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $5.3 million from this
offering.

The net proceeds from this offering must be remitted to China before we will be
able to use the funds to grow our business. We are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to Bamboo Tech, through capital contributions or
parent/subsidiary loans, subject to approvals from or registrations with
relevant PRC government authorities. We plan to use the capital contribution to
fund Bamboo Tech. We expect that a properly submitted application will be
approved in the ordinary course of business; however, we cannot guarantee such
an approval will occur or be timely. If our application for a capital
contribution is denied, we will use the parent/subsidiary loan method of funding
Bamboo Tech.

As mentioned, we currently anticipate financing our subsidiaries by means of
capital contributions. We currently anticipate using approximately 85% of the
gross proceeds from this offering to increase the registered capital of Bamboo
Tech (after which time Bamboo Tech may apply such funds to the purposes
described herein). The increase in registered capital will require prior
approval from (i) MOFCOM to increase Bamboo Tech’s registered capital, (ii) SAIC
to alter Bamboo Tech’s business certificate to reflect the increase in
registered capital and (iii) SAFE to allow Bamboo Tech’s bank to convert U.S.
dollars into RMB in order to fund such increased registered capital, or each of
the foregoing agencies’ respective local counterparts. This approval process
typically takes 30 to 90 days in total, and sometimes longer, from the time
MOFCOM or its local branches receive all the required application documents to
begin the process. The remaining approximately 15% of such gross proceeds will
be used to pay expenses related to this offering as well as for other general
corporate purposes.

We plan to remit money to China using the capital contribution method. The
approval from MOFCOM is the key approval in the capital contribution process,
and we believe all other approvals are ministerial if MOFCOM approves such
increase in registered capital. We have not yet initiated this process but
intend to start the process immediately upon completion of the offering. We do
not foresee any problem receiving necessary government approvals for a capital
contribution; however, if our application is rejected, we would remit money to
China through a parent/subsidiary loan instead. If we were to provide funding to
Bamboo Tech through parent/subsidiary loans (rather than the capital
contribution method), the total amount of such loans may not exceed $6,710,080
(RMB41,600,000), which is the difference between Bamboo Tech’s total investment
amount as approved by the foreign investment authorities (currently $19,614,080
(RMB121,600,000)), and Bamboo Tech’s registered capital (currently $19,614,080
(RMB121,600,000), and Bamboo Tech’s registered capital (currently $12,904,000
(RMB80,000,000). Such parent/subsidiary loans must also be registered with the
SAFE, which registration usually takes no more than 20 working days after
application to complete. The cost for obtaining such approvals and completing
such registration is minimal.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete these government
registrations or obtain the relevant approvals on a timely basis, if at all. The
procedure to remit funds may take several months after completion of this
offering, and we will be unable to use the funds in China until remittance is
completed. We have not yet initiated the process of remitting money to China
using either method but will begin to do so promptly upon completion of this
offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows after we complete
the remittance process, and we have ordered the specific uses of proceeds in
order of priority below.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our common shares. It is possible that we may become a
passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers, which
could result in negative tax consequences to you.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The occurrence of
unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of
the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this
prospectus.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of our common shares by
the selling shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the selling shareholder
has agreed with us and our Placement Agent to pay $500,000 from the proceeds it
will receive in this Offering into an account for the sole purpose of
indemnifying the Placement Agent against liability in connection with this
offering. Such amount will not reduce the amount of proceeds our Company
receives in this Offering. We do not have any contribution or
cross-indemnification agreement with the selling shareholder, and the Placement
Agent is not required to exhaust its remedies against our company before looking
to funds in this escrow account for indemnification."

approximately $34.9 million, based on the initial public offering price of
$8.50 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:

        • Approximately $16.5 million to $19.5 million on pre-commercialization
          and, if approved, initial commercialization activities for Trevyent,
          including the manufacturing and validation of registration stability
          lots and of commercial inventory. We expect such proceeds to fund the
          development and, if approved, commercialization of Trevyent through
          mid 2016, including the submission of an NDA in the first quarter of
          2016.

        • Approximately $8.0 million to $12.0 million on further development of
          our AHPA product candidates, including clinical trials to evaluate
          performance and safety and to establish a pharmacokinetic relationship
          between our AHPA product candidates and the applicable approved
          reference listed product. We expect such proceeds to commence pre-NDA
          development of our AHPA product candidates through mid 2016.

        • Approximately $3.5 million to $5.0 million on enhancements to our
          PatchPump delivery system, to broaden its applicability to future
          product candidates.

We will use the balance of the net proceeds, if any, for general corporate
purposes, including working capital, general and administrative matters and
other capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to
acquire or invest in complementary technologies, drug products or businesses or
to obtain rights to such complementary technologies, drug products or
businesses. There are no such transactions under consideration at this time.
Pending these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest
bearing obligations, investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or
direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States.

We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering."

working capital, and for other general corporate purposes, including to finance 
our organic growth and expand our business through investments in or 
acquisitions of bank and non-bank financial services companies that we believe 
are complementary to our business and consistent with our growth strategy. 
Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we may 
hold any net proceeds in cash or invest them in short-term securities or 
investments.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by 
the selling shareowner in this offering."

will be approximately $376.5 million (or $433.0 million if the underwriters 
exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common s
tock). Summit Holdings will bear or reimburse Summit Materials, Inc. for all of 
the expenses payable by it in this offering, which we estimate will be 
approximately $7.5 million.

We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this offering (including from 
any exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares 
of Class A common stock) to purchase a number of newly-issued LP Units from 
Summit Holdings that is equivalent to the number of shares of Class A common 
stock that we offer and sell in this offering.

We intend to cause Summit Holdings to use these proceeds as follows: (i) to 
redeem $288.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes at a 
redemption price of 100% and an applicable premium thereon; (ii) to purchase 
71,428,571 Class B Units of Continental Cement; (iii) to pay a one-time 
termination fee of $13.8 million to an affiliate of Blackstone in connection 
with the termination of a transaction and management fee agreement; and (iv) 
for general corporate purposes. As of December 27, 2014, $625.0 million 
aggregate principal amount of the senior notes was outstanding. The senior 
notes mature on January 31, 2020 and have an interest rate of 10.5% per annum. 
As of December 27, 2014, the applicable interest rate on our senior secured 
term loan facility, which matures on January 30, 2019, was 5.00%."

million, based on an offering price of $9.90 per ADS, or approximately $32.8 
million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
ADSs to cover over-allotments, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of October 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately £15.0
million ($24.0 million). We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds
from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as
follows:

. approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million to fund our ongoing Phase 1b 
  modified diet clinical trial of SMT C1100 and, if successful, initiate our 
  Phase 2 open label clinical trial and our Phase 2 placebo controlled clinical 
  trial of SMT C1100;  

. approximately $5.0 million to fund our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of 
  SMT19969 and our ongoing exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial of SMT19969 
  compared to fidaxomicin;  

. approximately $5.0 million to advance our second generation utrophin 
  modulators, future generation utrophin modulators, potential diet independent 
  formulations of SMT C1100 and our biomarker development program; and  

. the remainder for working capital and for general corporate purposes. 

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials of our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a
result, our management retains broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering, we estimate
that such funds, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be
sufficient to enable us to complete and report top line data from our ongoing
Phase 1b modified diet clinical trial of SMT C1100, report top line data from
our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of SMT19969, report top line data from our
ongoing exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial of SMT19969 compared to fidaxomicin
and report initial data from our Phase 2 open label clinical trial of SMT C1100.
We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we
could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. While
we anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering will allow us to initiate
our Phase 2 open label clinical trial and our Phase 2 placebo controlled
clinical trial of SMT C1100, we do not expect the net proceeds will be
sufficient to allow us to fund either of these clinical trials to completion.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including term
deposits, and short-term, investment-grade, and interest-bearing instruments."

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, or 
approximately $154.2 million if the underwriters exercise their option to 
purchase additional shares in full, based on the initial public offering price 
of $18.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our
access to the public equity markets. The offering is designed to provide funding
through multiple proof-of-concept readouts for our drug candidates. In 
particular, we currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as
follows:

. approximately $35.0 to 40.0 million for our two Phase 1 clinical trials of 
  BLU-285 in SM and GIST, including clinical research outsourcing, drug 
  manufacturing, companion diagnostic development and internal personnel costs;

. approximately $20.0 to 25.0 million for our Phase 1 clinical trial of BLU-554 
  in HCC, including clinical research outsourcing, drug manufacturing, companion
  diagnostic development and internal personnel costs; and

. approximately $40.0 million for new and ongoing research activities, including
  for our RET program and our platform with the goal of delivering one IND 
  annually on average.

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include funding
for the hiring of additional personnel, capital expenditures and the costs of
operating as a public company.

We believe the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash 
and cash equivalents, including the $15.0 million upfront payment received in 
March 2015 upon execution of the agreement with Alexion, will be sufficient to 
fund our Phase 1 clinical trials of BLU-285 in SM and GIST and of BLU-554 in 
HCC.

Based on our current plans, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, including
the $15.0 million upfront payment received in March 2015 upon execution of the 
agreement with Alexion, together with the net proceeds to us from this offering,
will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least early 2017.

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this 
offering as described above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of
funds is necessary. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will 
depend upon numerous factors, including our sales and marketing and 
commercialization efforts, demand for our drugs, our operating costs and  
other factors. Accordingly, our management will have flexibility in applying the
net proceeds from this offering. An investor will not have the opportunity to 
evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we base our 
decisions on how to use the proceeds.

Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the 
acquisition or licensing, as the case may be, of additional technologies, other
assets or businesses, or for other strategic investments or opportunities, we
have no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

(1) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the 
    proceeds of loans and advances from an affiliate of our Chief Executive 
    Officer and President totalling $140,938 that we drew down as described in 
    this prospectus. These loans and advances will be repaid upon completion of 
    this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting 
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in 
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital 
    expenses. 

(2) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial 
    business combination, $2,625,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions (or $3,018,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds 
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us 
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the 
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs 
    or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. 

(3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target 
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement 
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as 
    a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and 
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended 
    use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for 
    our expenses. 

(4) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing. 

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement 
shares, $78,750,000 (or $90,562,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option 
is exercised in full), including $2,625,000 (or $3,018,750 if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting 
commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, 
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. 
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the 
trust account will be approximately $16,000 per year, assuming an interest rate 
of 0.02% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in 
the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, the 
proceeds from this offering will not be released from the trust account until 
the earlier of (a) the completion of our initial business combination or (b) 
the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial 
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, subject 
to applicable law. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial 
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial 
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the 
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or 
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of 
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial 
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working 
capital. 

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the 
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business 
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due 
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the 
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional 
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek 
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our 
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons 
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. 

As of the date of this prospectus, Lepe Partners LLP, an affiliate of our Chief 
Executive Officer and President, has loaned and advanced to us a total of 
$140,938 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans 
and advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of 
December 31, 2015 or the closing of this offering. The loans and advances will 
be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering 
proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, 
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the 
trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of 
funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business 
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held 
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our 
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of 
such loans may be convertible into shares of the post business combination 
entity at a price of $10.00 per share at the option of the lender. Such shares 
would be identical to the private placement shares. The terms of such loans by 
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written 
agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination 
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors 
or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions 
either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in 
such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such 
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such 
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information 
not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation 
M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, 
if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under 
the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private 
rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time 
of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the 
purchasers will comply with such rules. 

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net 
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the 
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business 
combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth 
or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their 
redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement 
or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption 
of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such

prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors 
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be 
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to 
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination

this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and structuring fee and
estimated offering expenses, to (i) pay, together with borrowings of $85.9
million under our new term loan facility, a $144.5 million distribution to our
sponsor related to its contribution of assets to us in connection with this
offering, a portion of which is intended as a reimbursement of capital
expenditures of our sponsor, (ii) repay $81.9 million of intercompany
indebtedness related to the acquisition of our Cottondale plant and that we will
assume in connection with our sponsor’s contribution of its interests in Enviva
Pellets Cottondale, LLC and (iii) retain $45.0 million for general partnership
purposes, including future acquisitions. We will not be required to pay
additional cash consideration for such contributed assets. The indebtedness
related to the acquisition of our Cottondale plant bears interest at a rate of
4.00% per annum and will mature in 2020.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the underwriters and
the remainder, if any, will be issued to our sponsor. Any such units issued to
our sponsor will be issued for no additional consideration. If the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase 1,500,000 additional common units in full, the
additional net proceeds would be approximately $28.1 million. The net proceeds
from any exercise of such option will be used to make a special distribution to
our sponsor. If the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, we will issue 1,500,000 common units to our sponsor
upon the option’s expiration. We will not receive any additional consideration
from our sponsor in connection with such issuance. Accordingly, the exercise of
the underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of common units
outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly
distribution on all units."

we are offering will be approximately $19.1 million (or $22.4 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full), after
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering as follows:

• approximately $7.0 million to fund the continued clinical development of      
  VK5211, including a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
  Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with hip fracture;       

• approximately $5.0 million to fund the continued clinical development of     
  VK2809 and/or VK0214, including an open-label multicenter Phase 1            
  proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with adrenoleukodystrophy;       

• approximately $0.5 million to fund the continued development of our diabetes 
  program, VK0612;                                                             

• approximately $0.1 million to fund the continued development of our EPOR     
  program for anemia;                                                          

• approximately $0.1 million to fund the continued development of our DGAT-1   
  inhibitor program for lipid disorders; and                                   

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, based upon our
current operating plan, and assuming successful completion of this offering, we
believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our projected operating
requirements for at least the next 12 months, and to reach the following
milestones, based on their estimated timelines, with respect to our current drug
programs: complete the planned clinical trials for VK5211, VK2809 and/or VK0214;
conduct non-clinical pharmacology studies of VK0612 in animal models of type 2
diabetes; establish proof-of-concept in a relevant animal model of anemia for
the EPOR program, and complete the lead-optimization process for the DGAT-1
inhibitor program, in preparation of a potential IND filing. Therefore, even
with the expected net proceeds from this offering, we do not expect to have
sufficient cash to complete the clinical development of any of our drug
candidates or, if applicable, to prepare for commercializing any drug candidate
that is approved.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above.
The costs and timing of development activities, particularly conducting clinical
trials and preclinical studies, are highly uncertain, subject to substantial
risks and can often change. Due to the many variables inherent to the
development of our drug candidates, we cannot currently predict the stage of
development we expect the net proceeds of this offering to achieve for our
clinical trials, preclinical studies and drug candidates.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
in the category of other working capital and general corporate purposes. For
example, if we identify opportunities that we believe are in the best interests
of our stockholders, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
to acquire, invest in or license complementary products, technologies or
businesses, although we have no current understandings, agreements or
commitments to do so. In addition, the amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our
research and development efforts, the timing and success of preclinical studies,
our ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future 
and the timing of regulatory submissions. Depending on the outcome of
these activities and other unforeseen events, our plans and priorities may
change and we may apply the net proceeds of this offering toward different uses
and in different proportions than we currently anticipate.

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering as described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities or certificates of deposit."

the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, at the initial
public offering price of $17.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, to create a public market for our stock and thereby
enable access to the public equity markets for our employees and stockholders,
to obtain additional capital and to increase our visability in the marketplace.
We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering
primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and
marketing activities, solution and platform development, general and
administrative matters, and capital expenditures, although we do not currently
have any specific or preliminary plans with respect to the use of proceeds for
such purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition
of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our
business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into
any acquisitions or investments. We will have broad discretion over the uses of
the net proceeds of this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the
net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-
bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, 
commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

approximately $236.4 million, or approximately $272.7 million if the 
underwriters' option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, after 
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of this offering. We 
intend to contribute the net proceeds of this offering to our operating 
partnership, which we expect will subsequently use the net proceeds as follows:

. approximately $41.9 million to acquire 21 self-storage properties within our 
  in-place portfolio; 

. approximately $134.0 million to repay in full our US Bank senior term loans, 
  our unsecured term loan, and our mezzanine loan (including prepayment 
  penalties); and 

. approximately $60.5 million to pay down our revolving line of credit. 

The net proceeds remaining after the uses described above will be used for 
general corporate and working capital purposes. 

As of December 31, 2014, the two US Bank senior term loans we intend to repay 
with the net proceeds from this offering had outstanding balances of $52 
million and $6.5 million, respectively, bearing interest at one-month LIBOR 
plus margins of 2.10% and 2.25%, respectively (effective rates of 2.26% and 
2.41% per annum, respectively, as of December 31, 2014), and were scheduled to 
mature in June 2015 and October 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, 
the unsecured term loan we intend to repay had an outstanding balance of $50 
million, bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus a margin of 5.00% (an 
effective rate of 5.16% per annum, as of December 31, 2014) and was scheduled 
to mature in October 2015, following an extension option we exercised in early 
2015. The proceeds from the unsecured term loan were used to fund acquisitions. 
As of December 31, 2014, the mezzanine loan we intend to repay had an 
outstanding balance of $25 million, bearing interest at 9.65% per annum and was 
scheduled to mature in June 2015. 

As of December 31, 2014, our credit facility consisted of a term loan with an 
outstanding balance of $144.6 million and a revolving line of credit with an 
outstanding balance of $166.2 million. The term loan bears interest at 
one-month LIBOR plus 2.40% (an effective rate of 2.56% per annum as of December 
31, 2014) and the revolving line of credit bears interest at one-month LIBOR 
plus 2.50% (an effective rate of 2.66% per annum as of December 31, 2014). The 
term loan matures in March 2018 and the revolving line of credit matures in 
March 2017. On July 21, 2014, our credit facility was amended to provide for 
total borrowings of $144.6 million under the term loan and $280.4 million under 
the revolving line of credit for a total credit facility of $425 million. Upon 
the completion of this offering and the formation transactions, this credit 
facility, which was secured, will become an unsecured credit facility. We 
expect to have the entire term loan amount outstanding and $127.2 million drawn 
on our revolving line of credit upon the completion of this offering and the 
formation transactions. 

Until appropriate investments can be identified, we may invest the net proceeds 
from this offering in interest-bearing short-term investments, including money 
market accounts and/or U.S. treasury securities which are consistent with our 
intention to qualify as a REIT. These investments are expected to provide a 
lower net return than we will seek to achieve from our self-storage properties. 
We currently expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from this 
offering within six months from the completion of this offering and the 
formation transactions."

offering will be approximately $345.9 million, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares
in full, we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $398.2 million
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering (a) to pay
a $30.7 million termination fee, in the aggregate, to the Sponsors pursuant to
our management agreement with them, which will thereafter be terminated, and (b)
to redeem all or a portion of the senior PIK toggle notes, which mature on
August 15, 2019. The amount of senior PIK toggle notes we redeem will depend on
the amount of net proceeds from this offering remaining after payment of the
management agreement termination fee. Assuming no exercise of the underwriters’
option to purchase additional shares, we will use the remaining $315.2 million
of the net proceeds (after the payment of the management agreement termination
fee) to redeem $299.3 million of the senior PIK toggle notes, pay a $6.0 million
penalty due to the prepayment and pay accrued interest on such notes in the
amount of $9.9 million. We anticipate redeeming any outstanding PIK toggle notes
that are not redeemed with the proceeds from this offering with borrowings under
our ABL Facility.

In the event we generate more than $395.0 million of net proceeds, we expect to
redeem all outstanding senior PIK toggle notes with the proceeds from this
offering and to use any remaining proceeds to repay or repurchase additional
indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities.
The effect of the repayment of the senior PIK toggle notes on net income for the
year ended December 31, 2014, had it occurred on January 1, 2014, would have
been approximately $18.7 million, net of tax and excluding one-time costs and
charges of such debt repayment, including the write-off of net original issue
discount and premiums (inclusive of costs for any borrowings under the ABL
Facility).

We are required to pay interest in cash at a rate of 8.750% per annum on the
senior PIK toggle notes, unless certain conditions are satisfied, in which case
we are entitled to pay all or a portion of the interest by increasing the
principal amount of the notes or issuing additional notes (“PIK Interest”). PIK
Interest is paid at a rate of 9.500%. Under the terms of the indenture governing
the senior PIK toggle notes, prior to February 15, 2016, we may redeem the notes
at a price equal to 102% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon up to but not including the date of redemption.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors and
any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending
our use of the net proceeds from this offering as described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments,
including short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and
U.S. government securities."

$335.9 million of net proceeds. 

We intend to contribute $24.8 million of the net proceeds from this offering 
to Virtu Financial (or $58.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option

Financial Units equal to the contribution amount divided by the price paid by 
the underwriters for shares of our Class A common stock in this offering 
(1,402,880 Virtu Financial Units or, if the underwriters exercise their option 
to purchase additional shares in full, 3,327,164 Virtu Financial Units). 

Virtu Financial will contribute such net proceeds to its subsidiaries. We

working capital and general corporate purposes. We may use such net proceeds to
finance growth through the acquisition of, or investment in, businesses,
products, services or technologies that are complementary to our current

to application, we may hold any such net proceeds in cash or invest them in
short-term securities or investments. You will not have an opportunity to
evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we base our
decisions regarding the use of these proceeds.

We estimate that the offering expenses (other than the underwriting discount) 
will be approximately $10.3 million. All of such offering expenses will be 
paid for or otherwise borne by Virtu Financial.

C common stock from certain employees (or, if the underwriters exercise their

price equal to the price paid by the underwriters for shares of our Class A 
common stock in this offering. Certain of our 5% equityholders, directors and 
executive officers will receive a portion of the proceeds pursuant to these 
repurchases.

As a result of any purchases of Virtu Financial Units (together with a
corresponding number of shares of Class C common stock) as described above, the
number of outstanding shares of Class C common stock will be reduced. Because we
will hold the Virtu Financial Units that we acquire (and increase our ownership
position in Virtu Financial), the number of outstanding Virtu Financial Units
will remain the same."

facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes:

. approximately $20.0 million for the clinical development of CD101 IV and   
  CD101 topical, through the completion of Phase 2 clinical trials, and the  
  initiation of the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for CD101 topical;        

. approximately $15.0 million for the preclinical development, IND-enabling  
  studies and early clinical trials of our current Cloudbreak development    
  candidates;                                                                

. approximately $10.0 million for research and discovery efforts related to  
  the expansion of our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform to other areas of   
  infectious disease; and                                                    

. the balance to fund working capital, including general operating expenses.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire,
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.
However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including our ability to gain access to additional financing and the
relative success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development
programs. Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we
believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash
equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our
operations for at least the next 12 months. We anticipate that we will need to
secure additional funding for the development of any additional product
candidates we choose to develop.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to access additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs
and whether we are able to enter into future licensing arrangements. As a
result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might decide
to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or preclinical activities if the net
proceeds from this offering and any other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

stock in this offering, excluding the proceeds from the concurrent private
placement, will be approximately $107.7 million, after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $124.3 million after
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by
us. Our net proceeds from the concurrent private placement will be $25.0 
million.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. At December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash
equivalents of $119.5 million. We intend to use the net proceeds of this
offering and the concurrent private placement, together with our existing cash
and cash equivalents, as follows:

.  approximately $15.0 million to complete our ongoing ECLIPSE and STELLAR 
   Phase 2b clinical trials in pancreatic cancer;                          

.  approximately $40.0 million to advance the development of CRS-207 in    
   additional indications, including planned Phase 2 clinical trials in    
   mesothelioma and ovarian cancer;                                        

.  approximately $35.0 million to manufacture CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas at 
   commercial scale in preparation for potential regulatory approval;      

.  approximately $30.0 million for other research and development programs 
   involving our LADD and CDN platforms, including ADU-S100; and 

.  the remainder for general corporate and working capital purposes.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process,
it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds
from this offering and the concurrent private placement that may be used for the
above purposes. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend
upon numerous factors, including the results of our research and development
efforts, the timing and success of our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical
trials or preclinical studies and clinical trials we may commence in the future
and the timing of regulatory submissions. As a result, our management will have
broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies,
medicines or technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may
use a portion of the net proceeds for these.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."

underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares, based
upon the initial public offering price of $5.00 per share, and after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds that we will receive
from this offering as follows:

. approximately $25.0 million to $35.0 million to fund our continued research 
  and discovery efforts, including to fund to completion both our ongoing 
  COR1.1 and our future COR1.2 Phase 3 clinical trials of Hydros-TA in support 
  of an NDA filing with the FDA; 
 
. the remainder for working capital and other corporate purposes, which may 
  include the pursuit of other research and discovery efforts, including the 
  development of Hydros-TA for the treatment of OA pain in other joints in 
  the body. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay our
secured debt facility with Silicon Valley Bank, under which we owe approximately
$5.0 million in principal and interest as of December 31, 2014. We may also use 
a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary 
businesses, technologies, products or assets. However we have no current plan, 
commitments or obligations to do so. 

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
nonclinical testing or clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we
may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen
cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

cash equivalents will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the
next 12 months.

approximately US$35.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and

purposes, 20% of the net proceeds would be used for research and development on
mobile applications, 10% of the net proceeds would be used for marketing, and
10% of the net proceeds would be reserved for other miscellaneous uses. Working

In addition, the purposes of this offering also include the creation of a public

result in application of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as
described in this prospectus.

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not
immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds

9.0% per annum and matures on December 15, 2019 and contains prepayment premium
provisions. Our repayment of the senior note will require that we pay 104.5% of

excluding, the date of redemption.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $100,000 and $86,321 in advances
    made to us by our sponsor as described in this prospectus. These loans and  
    advances will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $750,000
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering    
    expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering    
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be    
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.                             

(3) Deferred underwriting commissions and other fees equal to an aggregate of   
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering will be placed into the trust   
    account at the closing of this offering. Upon completion of our initial     
    business combination, $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the underwriters’        
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the             
    underwriters. The remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to 
    pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses    
    with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate 
    purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness        
    incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the   
    purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will  
    not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting        
    discounts and commissions.                                                  

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business       
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific        
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses  
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal     
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may   
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due       
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, approximately $150,000,000 (or approximately $172,500,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $5,250,000
(or $6,037,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions and other fees, will be placed in a New
York, New York based trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $30,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year.
Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, if any, the
proceeds from this offering will not be released from the trust account until
the earlier of (a) the completion of our initial business combination or (b) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete our business combination. If our initial business combination is paid
for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the
trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our
business combination or used for redemptions of our ordinary shares, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.

However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.
 
We will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor loaned us $100,000 to be used
for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest
bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2015 or the
closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the
payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the
open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business
combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to
engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for
any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make
any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public
information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by
Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such
purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer
rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the
going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine
at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules,
the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those of our ordinary shares that
such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, and
then only in connection with those of our ordinary shares that such shareholder
properly elected to redeem, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we
are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements)
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.
   
Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting underwriting commissions
and expenses payable by us and other offering expenses payable by us, will be
approximately $4,400,000 if we sell a minimum of 1,000,000 shares and
approximately $8,950,000 if we sell all 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in
this offering. However, this is a best efforts offering and there is no
assurance that we will sell any shares or receive any proceeds.

We intend to use the net proceeds approximately as follows:

Expenditures in respect of our marketing and sales activities will include
increasing print advertisements in technology-related publications, targeted
Google Adwords campaigns, participating in technology trade shows and
conferences, expanding our network of resellers, improving our website design

organizations.

Funds for the hiring of additional technical and marketing personnel will be
used to recruit and retain new employees who will further the development,
support and sales of our terminal services products, design, produce and market
new products and expand the infrastructure of our business.

We have been historically dependent for substantially all of our financial
support from Bump Networks, Inc., a Hawaii software development and consulting
company indirectly owned by Arben Kryeziu, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. As at December 31, 2014, we owed Bump Networks $444,405 in outstanding
accounts payable for administrative, management and technical services provided
to us. Our outstanding accounts payable to Bump Networks does not currently
accrue interest and does not have any fixed maturity date. We will use a
maximum amount equal to 5% of the gross proceeds of this offering to reduce the
outstanding balance of this related-party payable. Accordingly, $250,000 of the
amount payable to Bump Networks will be paid following the sale of a minimum of
1,000,000 shares of common stock and up to a $444,405 (the total amount
outstanding as of December 31, 2014) will be paid following the sale of all
2,000,000 shares in this offering.

Funds for working capital and general corporate purposes include amounts
required to pay officers’ salaries, professional fees, ongoing public reporting
costs, office-related expenses and other corporate expenses, including interest
and overhead.

We believe the net proceeds of this offering, together with operating revenue
and the remaining proceeds from our recent private placement of 6% unsecured
promissory notes, will be sufficient to meet our cash, operational and liquidity
requirements for at least 12 months if we sell a minimum of 1,000,000 shares and
for at least 24 months if we sell all 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in
this offering. While the initial allocation of the net proceeds of this offering
represents our best estimates of their use, the amounts actually expended for
these purposes may vary significantly from the specific allocation of the net
proceeds set forth above, depending on numerous factors, including changes in
general economic and/or regulatory climate, and the progress and development of
potential collaborative working arrangements. However, there can be no
assurance these sources of funds, even assuming that this offering is
successful,will satisfy our requirements for any particular period of time.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. Accordingly, our
management will have broad discretion in the application of these proceeds. Net
offering proceeds not immediately applied to the uses summarized above will be
invested in short-term investments such as money market funds, commercial paper,
U.S. treasury bills and similar securities investments pending their use."

may also use a portion of the net proceeds to expand our business through
investments in or acquisitions of other complementary strategic joint ventures,
businesses, products or technologies, including potential investments along with
our seed company partners in product development and/or deregulation. We do not
have any understandings, commitments, or agreements with respect to any such
acquisitions or investments at this time.

We intend to invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government, pending their use as
described above.

Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public
market for our common stock and increase our visibility in the marketplace. A
public market for our common stock will facilitate future access to public
equity markets and enhance our ability to use our common stock as a means of
attracting and retaining key employees and as consideration for acquisitions."

approximately $256.7 (€225.9) million, based on the public offering price of
$42.05 per ADS in the U.S. offering and €37.00 per ordinary share in the
European private placement, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and assuming no
exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ordinary shares and
ADSs. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
ADSs in the U.S. offering and additional ordinary shares in the European private
placement, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the global
offering of approximately $295.1 (€259.7) million, based on the public offering
price of $42.05 per ADS in the U.S. offering and €37.00 per ordinary share in
the European private placement, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of the global offering are to increase our financial
flexibility to advance our clinical pipeline, create a public market for our
securities in the United States and facilitate our future access to the U.S.
public equity markets. We currently expect to use the net proceeds from the
global offering as follows:

• approximately $80 million to advance our CF program combination therapy   
  (GLPG1837, GLPG2222 and a second corrector candidate expected to be       
  identified later in 2015) in CF until the end of Phase 2 clinical         
  development;                                                              

• approximately $65 million to advance our IBD program (GLPG1205) until the 
  end of Phase 2 clinical development; and                                  

• approximately $30 million to advance the discovery and development of our 
  earlier stage programs, including our IPF program (GLPG1690).             

We expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from the global offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in complementary technologies, products or assets, either alone or together with
a collaboration partner. However, we have no current plan, commitments or
obligations to do so.

Based on our current operational plans and assumptions, we expect that the net
proceeds from the global offering, combined with our current operating capital,
will be sufficient to support the advancement of our research and development
programs until the end of 2017. However, there can be no assurance that these
expectations will be correct. 

We currently have no specific plans as to how the net proceeds from the global
offering will be allocated beyond the uses specified above, and therefore
management will retain discretion to allocate the remainder of the net proceeds
of the global offering among these uses.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the global offering
or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development efforts, the status of and results from pre-clinical
studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in
the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. For example,
in the event that AbbVie does not elect to in-license filgotinib in the second 
half of 2015 under our collaboration agreement with AbbVie, we may elect to use 
a portion of the net proceeds from the global offering to advance filgotinib on 
our own. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the 
allocation of the net proceeds from the global offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from the global offering, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments,
including short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

shares of our common stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us, will be approximately
$88.2 million (approximately $101.6 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full).

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, to fund the acquisition of the Founding Companies, to facilitate
future access to the public capital markets and to provide us with flexibility
in the future, including to acquire additional automotive recycling businesses,
either with the net proceeds from this offering or through the publicly traded
common stock we create through this offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, plus up to $11.5 million
of borrowings and letter of credit utilization under the credit facility to be
entered into with BMO Harris Bank N.A., to pay the approximately $93.2 million
cash portion of the Combination Consideration in the Combinations with the
Founding Companies. Such cash portion of the Combination Consideration will be
adjusted upward, based upon the Founding Companies’ working capital on the
closing date of the Combinations and certain other factors, by approximately
$6.5 million. Specifically, we intend to pay a portion of the cash component of
the Combination Consideration (i) with up to $5.6 million from our $10 million
of borrowings under the term loan portion of our credit facility and (ii)
through the issuance of $5.9 million of letters of credit under our credit
facility in lieu of escrowing cash to support a holdback of a portion of the
consideration that may be payable to the Canadian Founding Companies. We may
also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the
installments of the promissory notes we issued in the aggregate principal amount
of $200,000 in connection with the Combinations with the Founding Companies and
to repay debt assumed in the Combinations, which we currently expect to be $0.

While we have not allocated a specific amount of the remaining net proceeds from
this offering to any particular purpose, we may use such remaining net proceeds
for the acquisitions of additional automotive recycling businesses and general
corporate purposes. The net proceeds we actually expend for the acquisition of
additional businesses may vary significantly depending on a number of factors,
including our ability to locate such companies and enter into a binding
acquisition agreement on favorable terms and the negotiated purchase price. With
the exception of confidentiality agreements, we currently have no understandings
or agreements with any companies related to acquisitions of businesses other
than the Founding Companies. In addition, the net proceeds we actually expend
for general corporate purposes may vary significantly depending on a number of
factors, including future revenue growth and our cash flows. As a result, we
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the remaining net proceeds
from this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering, we
intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade securities."

in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be
approximately $17.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. Of the estimated offering expenses,
we already paid approximately $1.6 million and therefore will have approximately
$1.6 million of additional cash from this offering available to us.

We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $2.4 million for clinical studies and regulatory approval costs
  related to Canalevia for CID ($0.4 million) and general watery diarrhea
  ($2.0 million) in dogs;

• approximately $2.1 million for clinical studies and regulatory approval costs
  related to the other prescription drug products in our pipeline, namely 
  species-specific formulations of crofelemer for general watery diarrhea in 
  cats ($0.4 million), acute colitis in horses ($0.7 million), and gastric and
  colonic ulcers in horses and proof-of-concept studies for NP-500

• approximately $3.5 million for studies and activities inside and outside the
  United States and for commercial activities related to the launch of   
  Canalevia, our lead prescription drug product candidate for the treatment of
  various forms of watery diarrhea in dogs and for the continued
  commercialization efforts related to Neonorm both domestically and
  internationally;

• approximately $1.0 million for studies and field trials relating to Neonorm
  Calf and additional non-prescription formulations of Neonorm for other animal
  species including horse foals and adult horses;

• approximately $2.2 million for costs associated with developing
  species-specific formulations of our products;

• approximately $2.1 million for establishing third-party manufacturing
  capability, including the technology transfer at Indena S.p.A. pursuant to
  our memorandums of understanding;

• Approximately $1.3 million to repay the notes with an aggregate principal
  amount of $1.0 million that we borrowed in December 2014 pursuant to our
  Standby Bridge Financing Agreement. These notes had 10% original issue
  discount, have a stated interest rate of 12%, and provide for payment of 118%
  of the aggregate amount of principal plus interest, along with any other
  payments due, at maturity. We used the funds from these notes for working
  capital; and

• the remaining funds will be utilized for working capital and general
  corporate purposes.

A portion of the proceeds of this offering may also be used for repayment of up
to $250,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes that is
currently outstanding if the holders thereof demand payment thereof, which they
have the right to do at any time within 30 days following completion of this
offering. In addition, we also have the right to prepay these notes at any time
within 30 days following completion of this offering, although we do not
currently have any intention to do so. These notes bear interest at 12% per
annum, were issued pursuant to a convertible note and warrant purchase agreement
dated December 23, 2014, and the proceeds from their sale was used for working
capital purposes.

These expected uses of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current financial condition, results of operations,

  commenced in Israel;

• Approximately $233,000 for BVX-007, a Phase 2 clinical trial, expected to be

pharmaceutical companies and/or national health authorities to finance Phase 3

º approximately $45.0 million for the development of our commercial
  infrastructure to launch Xtampza, including building our sales, marketing and

• approximately $15.8 million to advance other research, discovery and      
  development activities; and                                               

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,   
  including funding the costs of operating as a public company.             

In December 2011, in connection with our facility lease, we issued a $2.0
million subordinated convertible unsecured promissory note to the venture arm of
our landlord, BioMed Realty, L.P. which was subsequently transferred to its
affiliate, BMV Direct RE LP. The note bears interest at an annual rate of 8.0%
and matures at the earlier of (i) May 2015, (ii) a liquidation event, and
(iii) the closing of an initial firm commitment underwritten public offering of
our common stock pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act,
unless previously converted. At any time prior to maturity, the holder may elect
to convert the principal outstanding under the promissory note into shares of
our Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock at the price of $2.662 per
share, and upon conversion, all accrued interest would be forgiven. We may use a
portion of the proceeds from this offering to repay the principal and accrued
interest under the note, equal to approximately $2.5 million as of December 31,
2014, assuming the note holder does not elect, on or prior to the date of
completion of this offering, to forgive all accrued interest under the note and
convert the $2.0 million in principal under the note into 751,314 shares of our
Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, which would convert into 94,455
shares of common stock upon completion of this offering, in accordance with the
terms described above.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire, or invest
in additional businesses, technologies, products, or assets. Although we have no
specific agreements, commitments, or understandings with respect to any
in-license or acquisition, we evaluate such opportunities and engage in related
discussions with other companies from time to time. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations depending upon
numerous factors, including the progress of our research and development
efforts, the progress of our clinical trials, our operating costs and capital
expenditures and the other factors. Accordingly, we will retain the discretion 
to allocate the net proceeds of this offering among the identified uses 
described above, and we reserve the right to change the allocation of the net 
proceeds among the uses described above.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government, or hold the net proceeds as cash."

the Class A shares (or approximately $1.3 billion if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional Class A shares in full), based upon the
initial public offering price of $29.00 per Class A share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions.

We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering (excluding any proceeds
from the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase additional Class A
shares) to Tallgrass Equity in exchange for Tallgrass Equity’s issuance to us
of Tallgrass Equity units. 

At the closing of this offering, Tallgrass Equity intends to enter into a new
$150 million revolving credit facility, and to borrow approximately $150 million,
the proceeds of which will be used, together with the net proceeds from this
offering that Tallgrass Equity receives from us, to purchase 20 million TEP
common units from Tallgrass Development at $47.68 per TEP common unit (with the
price per TEP common unit being determined based on a 2.25% discount to the
volume weighted average price of the TEP common units for the 30 trading days
prior to April 15, 2015) and to pay offering expenses and other transaction
costs. Tallgrass Equity intends to distribute the remaining proceeds, if any, to
the Exchange Right Holders. 

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Class A shares,
we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of such shares to purchase a
corresponding number of Tallgrass Equity units from the Exchange Right Holders
(which would equal 6,225,000 additional Tallgrass Equity units if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Class A shares in
full). In this case, an equivalent number of Class B shares will be cancelled.
After the application of the net proceeds from this offering, we will own a
26.39% membership interest in Tallgrass Equity (or a 30.35% membership interest
if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional Class A shares is exercised
in full)."

approximately $51.4 million if the underwriters’ exercise their over-allotment
option in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in
this offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes:

• approximately $18.5 million for sales and marketing and general and
  administrative expenses;

• approximately $7.7 million for research and development expenses, including:

• approximately $4.4 million for personnel costs, including expansion of our
  research and development team; and

• approximately $3.3 million for the development of new applications and
  profiling panels;

• approximately $4.8 million for repayments on our (i) outstanding loan borrowed
  under our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and Oxford
  Finance LLC, which bears interest at the rate of 8.5% per annum and matures in
  September 2018, and which loan proceeds have been used to fund our operations
  and (ii) Nuvogen obligation; and

• the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to in-license,
acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or
assets. However we have no current plans, commitments or obligations to do so.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through at least the next 12 months, which we expect will enable us
to complete the development of our planned applications and profiling panels
through 2015.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering.

of approximately $175.7 million, based on the initial public offering price of 
$17.00 per ADS, or $202.3 million if the underwriters exercise their option to 
purchase additional ADSs in full, in each case after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the offering 
payable by us.

As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $101.5 million of cash and cash 
equivalents and $24.8 million of short-term deposits. We intend to use the net 
proceeds we receive from this offering together with our existing cash on hand, 
as follows:

• $30 million to advance and accelerate the clinical development of our MAGE 
  A-10 TCR therapeutic candidate through Phase 1/2 clinical trials;

• $25 million to put in place a pilot manufacturing capability for our clinical 
  trials and fund its operations until the middle of 2018, and to initiate a 
  feasibility assessment for a commercially viable manufacturing platform for 
  all of our TCR therapeutic candidates;

• $140 million to advance additional TCR therapeutic candidates into preclinical
  testing, continue preclinical testing of our AFP TCR therapeutic candidate and
  progress such TCR therapeutic candidates through to clinical trials as quickly
  as possible; and

• the remainder to fund working capital, including other general corporate 
  purposes.

The expected uses of the net proceeds we receive from this offering represent 
our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenses may vary significantly depending on numerous 
factors including progression of our TCR therapeutic candidates through their 
respective preclinical and clinical programs and the data obtained. Accordingly,
we will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this 
offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management 
regarding the application of the net proceeds.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering, our existing 
cash and cash equivalents on hand together with expected milestone payments to 
us under our GSK collaboration and license agreement, we estimate that such 
funds will be sufficient to enable us to advance and accelerate clinical 
development of existing preclinical candidates, put in place a pilot 
manufacturing capability for our clinical trials and fund its operations until
the middle of 2018, and to initiate a feasibility assessment for a commercially
viable manufacturing platform, advance additional TCR therapeutic candidates
into preclinical testing, progress such TCR therapeutic candidates through
clinical trials, and fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for the foreseeable future, including for at least the next
24 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be
wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently
expect in which case we would need to secure additional funding to further
advance our MAGE A-10 TCR therapeutic candidate through clinical development and
for future TCR therapeutic candidates we choose to develop. Pending these uses,
we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short or medium-term
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.K. or U.S. governments."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $44.8 million to fund our clinical trials of lasmiditan and 
  to fund development of lasmiditan; and

. the remainder for working capital, general and administrative expenses and 
  other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in 
the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing

indications, as well as any additional collaborations that we may enter into 
with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. 
As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation 
of the net proceeds from this offering.

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our 
existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to enable us to complete 
our two planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of lasmiditan, as well as fund 
our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through mid-2017. 
We do not currently anticipate that any of the net proceeds from this offering 
will be used to fund the development of IV lasmiditan. We have based this 
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our

be approximately $12,771,875, based upon the initial public offering price of 
$6.00 per unit, and after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions

over-allotment option to purchase additional shares of our common stock and/or
Offered Warrants from us is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds
will be approximately $15,134,753. Our net proceeds do not include proceeds from
the expected purchase of 350,000 of the offered units by persons affiliated with
jVen Capital, LLC, affiliates of Versant Ventures, Harris & Harris Group, Inc.
and entities affiliated with Cross Creek Capital, L.P. in exchange for tendered
secured demand notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2.1 million, and
cancellation of that indebtedness by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We currently intend
to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $5.0 million for sales and marketing activities, including 
  expansion of our sales force to support the ongoing commercialization of our 
  MDRO gene test products and, when development is completed, our Lighthouse 
  MDRO Management System, and for working capital and general and administrative
  purposes;

. approximately $4.0 million for research and development related to the 
  continued support of our completion of the development of our Lighthouse MDRO 
  Management System and future products in our pipeline; and

. the remainder for general and administrative expenses (including compensation
  of our officers and directors and other personnel-related costs and costs of 
  operating as a public company), and for working capital and other general 
  corporate purposes.

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to pursue
our planned sales and marketing activities through the end of calendar year
2016. The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering. We will
have discretion in the way that we use the net proceeds and investors will be
relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this
offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous
factors, including the success of our product development pipeline activities
and acceptance of our products by key opinion leaders, hospitals, long-term care
facilities and other healthcare providers.

Depending on the outcome of these factors, our plans and priorities may change,
and we may be required to apply the net proceeds of this offering differently 
than we currently anticipate, and it may be necessary to allocate more or less 
of the net proceeds to the categories described above. We do not expect that we 
will decrease our estimated allocations to selling and marketing or research and
development activities to fund potential acquisitions or for general and
administrative expenses if doing so would have an adverse effect on the 
financial resources we believe will be necessary for us to pursue our business

(1)$171,306 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
   FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and 
   a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
   borrowed from Arowana Partners Group Pty Ltd. described below. These funds 
   will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. If we 
   determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would not be repaid.  

(2)No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of 
   the private units.  

(3)The funds held in the trust account will be used to acquire a target 
   business, to pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares for 
   a portion of the funds held in the trust account and potentially to pay 
   our expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital 
   equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering upon consummation 
   of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection with 
   our initial business combination. Our expenses relating to the acquisition 
   of a target business would either come from the funds held in the trust 
   account or additional funds otherwise available to us outside of the trust 
   account, including cash held by the target business. Any remaining funds 
   will be disbursed to the combined company and be used as working capital 
   to finance the operations of the target business.  

(4)The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $500,000 
   even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income earned 
   on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such 
   interest income) will be available to us to pay for our working capital 
   requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be 
   approximately $45,900 over an 18-month period assuming an interest rate of 
   approximately 0.05% per year.  

(5)These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
   items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
   incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
   connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
   based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not 
   anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
   fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
   fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
   category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.  

Our initial shareholders and their affiliates have committed to purchase an
aggregate of 455,000 private units at a price of $10.00 per unit ($4,550,000 in
the aggregate) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the
closing of this offering. Our initial shareholders and their affiliates have
also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters,
they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit an additional number of
private units (up to a maximum of 54,000 private units) pro rata with the amount
of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least $10.20 per share sold to
the public in this offering is held in trust regardless of whether the
over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. All of the proceeds we
receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.

$73,440,000, or $84,456,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account in the United States, maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Pursuant to the
investment management trust agreement that will govern the investment of such
funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will direct UBS Financial
Services to invest the funds as set forth in such written instructions and to
custody the funds while invested and until otherwise instructed in accordance
with the investment management trust agreement. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes having
a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
and that invest solely in United States government treasuries, so that we are
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except
with respect to (i) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that
may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations and (ii) any
remaining interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us for our working capital requirements, the proceeds will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we will pay Arowana International, an
affiliate of our executive officers, a monthly fee of $10,000 pursuant to a
letter agreement for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. The foregoing arrangement is being agreed to
by Arowana International for our benefit and is not intended to provide our
executive officers compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on 
rents and fees for similar services in North Sydney, Australia, that the fee 
charged by Arowana International is at least as favorable as we could have 
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon 
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. 

Other than the $10,000 monthly administrative fee, no compensation of any kind
(including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of
our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the
consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. In addition, the interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be released to
us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for a business
combination. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to
use the after-tax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees
to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for
director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held
in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto,
including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds
raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might
become payable) upon consummation of our initial business combination for
assisting us in connection with our initial business combination. If the 
payment of our liabilities, including the fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital, 
were to reduce the amount available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders 
who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held 
in the trust account, we would not be able to consummate such transaction. To 
the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as consideration 
to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which 
are not used to consummate a business combination, to pay holders who wish to 
convert their shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account 
or pay our expenses relating thereto (which could include the up to $2,760,000 
payable to EarlyBirdCapital described above if the over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along 
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to 
finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds 
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the 
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, 
research and development of existing or new products. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Kevin Chin has agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of February 28, 2015, Arowana Partners Group Pty Ltd. loaned to us an
aggregate of $171,306 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA
filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion
of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan is payable without interest
on the earlier of (i) October 21, 2015, (ii) the date on which we consummate our
initial public offering or (iii) the date on which we determine to not proceed
with our initial public offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses. If we determine
not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be
evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation
of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s
discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of
our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per
unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000
ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 rights
included in the private units would result in the issuance of 5,000 shares upon
the closing of our business combination, as well as 50,000 warrants to purchase
25,000 shares). Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and
underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder
wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial
business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination,
the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such public shares or
sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection with a business
combination which we consummate or in connection with an amendment to our
memorandum and articles of association prior to the consummation of an initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

approximately $93.4 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, based upon the initial public offering price of $14.00 per
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the sale of shares by the selling stockholders if the underwriters exercise
their over-allotment option, although we will bear the costs, other than
underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with those sales.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and facilitate our
future access to the capital markets. We also expect to use the net proceeds
from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We
may use a portion of the proceeds from this offering for acquisitions or

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on
many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of
our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this

deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital,
enhance our financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace
and create a public market for our Class A common stock. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering primarily (i) to expand research and product
development, customer service, and sales and marketing, including hiring new

infrastructure and operational support, and (iii) for general corporate and
working capital purposes. We also intend to repay $10.0 million of the

Our credit facility requires us to pay a prepayment premium of 2% of the amount
prepaid in the event of prepayment from the proceeds of an initial public

fluctuating rate. As of March 31, 2015, the outstanding borrowings under our
credit facility were $10.0 million. The outstanding borrowings under our credit
facility were used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

In addition, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest
in complementary businesses, services, technologies or intellectual property
rights. However, we have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such
acquisitions or investments at this time.

Our expected uses of the net proceeds from this offering are based upon our
present plans, objectives and business condition. As of the date of this

net proceeds from this offering, and management has not estimated the amount of
proceeds, or the range of proceeds, to be used for any particular purpose. The
amounts and timing of our actual uses of net proceeds will vary depending on
numerous factors. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be
relying on our management’s judgment regarding the application of the net
proceeds.

Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering, consistent with our
investment policy, we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment grade,
short-term interest-bearing obligations, such as money-market funds,

price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus), after deducting
underwriting discounts, structuring fees and estimated offering expenses. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• $181.0 million will be distributed to our parent, in part, as a reimbursement

follows:

• approximately $25 million to advance the clinical development of SER-109 for 
  the prevention of further recurrences of CDI in patients suffering from 
  recurrent CDI, which we expect will be sufficient to complete our Phase 2 
  clinical study that we initiated in May 2015;          

• approximately $40 million to advance the development of our other product 
  candidates, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-155, which we expect will be sufficient 
  to complete pre-clinical studies and, if supported, file an investigational 
  new drug application, for one or more of these product candidates; and

• the remainder, if any, to fund current and future research and development
  activities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire, or invest in additional
businesses, technologies, products or assets, although currently we have no
specific agreements, commitments or understandings in this regard. As of the
date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or
the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Predicting
the cost necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult and we
anticipate that we will need additional funds to complete the development of
SER-262, SER-287, SER-155 and any other product candidates we identify. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development efforts, the status of and results from pre-clinical
studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in
the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering.

net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including

capital contribution, and intend to commence such registration immediately after
the completion of this offering. We anticipate the registration process to take
two to three months, and as the process is administrative, we do not anticipate
any issue when we apply. We will then finance the activities of our consolidated
affiliated entities with the proceeds in RMB from Yulong WFOE to our
consolidated affiliated entities.

To the extent that a certain portion or all of the net proceeds we receive from
this offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we plan to
invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments or bank
deposits. These investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of your investment in our ordinary shares. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we have agreed with the representative of our
underwriters to deposit $600,000 from the net proceeds that we will receive in
this offering into an account for the sole purpose of indemnifying the
representative against liability in connection with this offering, which amount
will remain in such account for two years from the closing of this offering."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to (i) repay a portion of
the term loan debt outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility and (ii) repay
up to $15.0 million of debt outstanding under the ABL Facility to the extent any
amounts are outstanding upon consummation of this offering. The term loan debt
to be repaid has a maturity date of September 28, 2020 and the effective
interest rate per annum applicable to our New Term Loan Facility is set based on
a defined LIBOR rate plus a margin of 3.50% per annum (following this offering
the margin will range from 3.25% to 3.50% per annum based on our leverage
ratio). At no point will such LIBOR rate be less than 1% and as of March 31,
2015 the defined LIBOR rate was at 1%. The net proceeds from the New Term Loan
Facility were used (i) to repay in full $339.1 million principal amount
outstanding under our existing term loan facility, (ii) to redeem in full $220.0
aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Senior Secured Notes on May 15,
2015 at a redemption price of 106.281% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, to, but not including May 15, 2015 and (iii) to pay
an approximately $145 million cash dividend to the holders of our common stock.

margin of 1.75% to 2.25% per annum, based on availability. As of March 31, 2015
the effective interest rate on the borrowings under our ABL Facility was 4%.

If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from us is exercised
in full, we estimate that we will receive additional net proceeds of $40.2

purposes.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds. The occurrence of unforeseen events or
changed business conditions could result in application of the net proceeds of

our common stock in this offering will be $58.8 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us in
connection with this offering. The underwriters also have the option to purchase
up to an additional 1,423,243 shares of common stock. We estimate that the net
proceeds, if the underwriters exercise their right to purchase the maximum of
1,423,243 additional shares of common stock from us, will be approximately
$66.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated expenses payable by us in connection with this offering.

We expect to use net proceeds from this offering, together with net proceeds of
$354.8 million from our new term facility and cash on hand, primarily for the
following purposes:

• approximately $418.0 million to redeem in full our outstanding 9.750% Senior

• if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of

As of March 31, 2015, the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit
facility accrued interest at 2.17%.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
ongoing status of and results from our current development and commercialization
activities, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will

GLAUKOS CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/glaukos-corp-380463-78404,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/glaukos-corp-380463-78404,424B4,6/25/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10776392,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of
common stock in this offering will be approximately $97.2 million, or
$112.3 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, obtain additional capital, facilitate our future access to the
public equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential
customers and improve our competitive position.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately $20.0 million to hire additional sales, marketing and customer
  service personnel and expand marketing programs both in the United States and
  outside the United States;

• approximately $15.0 million to fund clinical studies evaluating our pipeline
  of products under development and regulatory approvals for such products;

• approximately $15.0 million for the purchase of the glaucoma-related
  intellectual property and other assets from our affiliate DOSE Medical
  Corporation, or DOSE, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated as of 
  July 10, 2014; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The purchase price we are paying for the DOSE assets was based in part on the
results of a valuation conducted by an independent third-party and is equal to
$15.0 million plus the cancellation of all indebtedness owed to us by DOSE
($10.2 million as of March 31, 2015) as of the date of the completion of the
asset sale, the consummation of which is expected to occur upon completion of
this offering. Each of our 5% or greater stockholders and certain of our
officers and directors owns shares in DOSE generally equivalent to their
percentage ownership of our company. Two of our current directors currently
serve as the sole members of the board of directors of DOSE. 
    
We may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire and invest in
complementary products, technologies or businesses; however, other than the DOSE
asset acquisition, we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete
any such transaction. The amount and timing of these expenditures will vary
depending on a number of factors, including competitive and technological
developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business.

The completion dates and costs for our clinical development programs, including
seeking regulatory approvals, and our research programs can vary significantly
for each current and future product candidate and are difficult to predict. We
anticipate we will make determinations as to which programs and product
candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program and product
candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific success of early
research programs, results of ongoing and future clinical trials, as well as
ongoing assessments as to each current or future product candidate's commercial
potential and our likelihood of obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals.
In addition to the net proceeds from this offering, we also intend to use cash
on hand, and cash generated from sales of our iStent products to meet our needs.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the proceeds. Although we
currently expect that our cash on hand and cash from operations, together with
the proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our 18 ongoing
prospective clinical trials through completion, if we are not successful in
generating sufficient cash from operations or our clinical trials are more
costly than we anticipate, we may need to raise additional funds in order to
complete these trials.

Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to
invest our net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

We expect to use $87 million of the net proceeds from this offering to reduce 
the amounts owed under our senior secured credit facilities in connection with 
their expected refinancing. Following this reduction in the amounts owed under 
our senior secured credit facilities and their expected refinancing, there will 
be $570 million in aggregate principal amount under our Refinancing Facility

purposes which may include: vessel acquisitions; funding a portion of the 
approximately $1.4 billion remaining installment payments, as of June 7, 2015,

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option, we
estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $62.0 
million.

As of March 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $24.3 
million. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this 
offering, together with our cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $30.0 million for the clinical development of CAT-1004;

• approximately $15.0 million for the clinical development of CAT-2054; and

• the remainder for other product candidates, working capital and other general 
  corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash 
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans
and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from
clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties
for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or understandings
for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products, businesses or
technologies.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing 
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to 
enable us to complete our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CAT-1004 and our 
planned Phase 2 development of CAT-2054, and to fund our operating expenses, 
debt service and capital expenditure requirements at least through 2016. We have 
based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use 
our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not 
expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash 
equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of 
development of any of our product candidates.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and 
U.S. government securities."

net proceeds will be approximately $20.2 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $9.4 million to fund the continued clinical development of
  RP-G28 for the reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance,
  including our anticipated Phase 2b/3 trial and non-clinical development;

• approximately $0.5 million to explore potential orphan indications; and
 
• approximately $5.0 million for general corporate purposes, general and
  administrative expenses, capital expenditures, working capital and prosecution
  and maintenance of our intellectual property.
 
We estimate that the net proceeds of this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2015, will enable us to complete our
planned Phase 2b/3 trial. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures,
however, will depend upon numerous factors, including the status and results of
our Phase 2b/3 trial and research and development efforts. Furthermore, we
anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding for the further
development of RP-G28 and for the development of our other product candidates.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs.
As a result, management will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the 
application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might decide
to postpone or not pursue other clinical trials or preclinical activities if the
net proceeds from this offering and the other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in a
variety of capital preservation instruments, including short- and

approximately $90.2 (€79.3) million, based on the public offering price of
$68.56 (€60.25) per ADS in the U.S. offering and €60.25 per ordinary share in
the European private placement, after deducting underwriting commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us, and assuming no exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional ordinary shares and ADSs. If the
underwriters exercise in full their options to purchase additional ordinary
shares and ADSs in the global offering, we estimate that we will receive net
proceeds from the global offering of approximately $104.2 (€91.5) million, based
on the public offering price of $68.56 (€60.25) per ADS in the U.S. offering and
€60.25 per ordinary share in the European private placement, after deducting
underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of the global offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our securities in the United States and
facilitate our access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to use
the net proceeds from the global offering as follows:

. approximately $15.0 million to advance the development of C-Cure through Phase
  3 clinical development as a treatment for ischemic HF;

. approximately $5.0 million to advance the development of CAR-NKG2D through
  Phase 1 clinical development as a treatment for AML and MM;

. approximately $40.0 million to advance additional CAR T-cell therapy drug
  product candidates for the treatment of additional blood cancers and solid
  tumors; and

. approximately $5.0 million to support our growth globally by expanding
  general, administrative and operational functions in our headquarters in
  Belgium and in the United States.

We expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from the global offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in complementary technologies, products or assets. However we have no current
plan, commitments or obligations to do so.

Based on our current operation plans and assumptions, we believe that such
proceeds, together with our existing cash, will be sufficient to fund our
operations until at least the end of 2017. However, changing circumstances may
cause us to increase our spending significantly faster than we currently
anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because
of circumstances beyond our control. We may require additional capital for the
further development and commercialization of our drug product candidates and may
need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to expand more rapidly than
we presently anticipate. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be
available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no committed source of
additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in
sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly
delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our
drug product candidates or other research and development initiatives. Our
licenses may also be terminated if we are unable to meet the payment obligations
under the agreements. We could be required to seek collaborators for our drug
product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on
terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or
license on unfavorable terms our rights to our drug product candidates in
markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization
ourselves. Any these events could significantly harm our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our ADSs
and our ordinary shares to decline.

We currently have no specific plans as to how the net proceeds from the global
offering will be allocated beyond the uses specified above and therefore
management will retain discretion to allocate the remainder of the net proceeds
of the global offering among these uses.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the global offering
or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development efforts, the status of and results from pre-clinical
studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in
the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our drug product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from the global offering.

increase our visibility in the marketplace. We intend to use approximately
$28.0 million of the net proceeds received from this offering to expand sales

the initial public offering price of $14.50 per share and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

We expect to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering to expand
our operations through the opening of new branches, acquisitions and for general
corporate purposes. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to
finance mergers or acquisitions of non-bank financial services companies,
although we have no present agreements or commitments to make any acquisition.
While our growth strategy includes opening new branches and completing strategic
mergers or acquisitions and we regularly identify and explore specific
acquisition opportunities as part of our ongoing business practices, we have no
present agreements or commitments to use any of the net proceeds from this
offering for these purposes over the next twelve months. However, if
opportunities to open new branches or complete acquisitions present themselves,
then we may choose to use some or all of the net proceeds to take advantage of
such opportunities. We currently do not intend to use any of the net proceeds we
will receive from this offering to add capital to BAF or LSB.

The amounts and timing of these expenditures will depend on numerous factors,
including the amount of our future revenues and net income, our ability to
identify attractive expansion and acquisition opportunities and the success of
our marketing efforts. Accordingly, our management will retain broad discretion
in deploying the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the uses described
above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade,

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we       
    received from an affiliate described below. These funds will be repaid out  
    of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. has agreed to defer $3,375,000 of its underwriting
    commissions (or $4,387,500 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option
    is exercised in full), which equals 2.25% of the gross proceeds from the
    units offered to the public (plus 4.5% of the gross proceeds from the units
    sold in the over-allotment option, if exercised), until consummation of our
    initial business combination. Upon consummation of our initial business
    combination, $3,375,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred
    commissions (or $4,387,500 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is
    exercised in full) will be paid to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. from the funds
    held in the trust account. No discounts, commissions or fees will be paid
    with respect to the purchase of the private warrants.

(3) We have agreed to pay advisory fees to Brock Securities LLC in an amount
    equal to 0.75% of up to $150 million of gross proceeds from the offering
    which is payable upon the closing of the offering. This amount excludes
    additional advisory fees payable to that underwriter in an amount equal to
    0.75% of up to $150 million of gross proceeds from the offering which is
    payable upon the closing of our initial business combination (plus, if the
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised, an additional amount equal
    to 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the exercise of the over-allotment
    option), and will be paid from the funds held in the trust account.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at
    $1,000,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest   
    income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to 
    us to pay income or other tax obligations. We estimate the interest earned  
    on the trust account will be approximately $150,000 over a 24-month period  
    assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.05% per year.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial        
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business    
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of         
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated 
    expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates   
    for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess    
    working capital.

Our sponsor and an entity controlled by Mr. Anderson, one of our director
nominees, and their designees have committed to purchase the private warrants
(for an aggregate purchase price of $6,225,000) from us on a private placement
basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Each private
warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one ordinary share at $5.75
per half share. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be
placed in the trust account described below.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $150,000,000, or $172,500,000 if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full, will be placed in an account in the United States at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, as trustee. The funds held in the trust account will be invested only
in United States government treasury bills, notes or bonds having a maturity of
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that
invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our
income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial business
combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we
have not completed a business combination in the required time period. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to TEG, an affiliate of our sponsor, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by TEG for our benefit
and is not intended to provide our officers or directors with compensation in
lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in
New York, New York, that the fee charged by TEG is at least as favorable as we
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the
trust account to our public shareholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee,
no compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, members of our 
management team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services 
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial 
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on 
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses 
to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after our 
initial business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $1,000,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account may be released to us to to pay income or other tax obligations.
The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our shares are used in
whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination,
the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a
business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’s
operations, for development and construction of one or more mining assets, for
strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing
or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, ESOF has agreed to pay the funds necessary to
complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than $20,000) and
has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of April 10, 2015, an affiliate of our sponsor loaned to us an aggregate of
$5,281 to be used for entity formation costs. The loan is payable without
interest on the earlier of (i) June 30, 2015, (ii) the date on which we
consummate our initial public offering or (iii) the date on which we determine
to not proceed with our initial public offering. The loan will be repaid out of
the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our sponsor, officers and directors or their affiliates may,
but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a non-interest bearing promissory note. The notes would either
be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,000,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into additional private warrants
at a price of $0.50 per warrant. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of
the warrants and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the 
extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of 
our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business 
combination, the loans will not be repaid.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination instead of
conducting a tender offer to allow our public shareholders to seek redemption of
their shares, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may
also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or
following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have
no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and
have not formulated any terms or conditions for such any transactions. If they
engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are
in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller
or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We
do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a
tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not complete a business combination that would cause our net tangible
assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s
“penny stock” rules). The agreement for our business combination, however, may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (1) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (2) if that public shareholder
elects to redeem ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to
approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to
shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity or (3) if that public
shareholder sells shares to us in any tender offer in connection with a proposed
initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

common shares in this offering will be approximately $290.0 million, or
approximately $333.9 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional common shares in full, based on the initial public offering
price of $15.00 per common share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes:

. approximately $95.0 million to $105.0 million to fund our planned Phase 3 
  registration program for RVT-101 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate 
  Alzheimer's disease; and

. the remainder to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, which 
  may include research and development of RVT-101 for other indications and the 
  satisfaction of any milestone payment obligations that become due under our 
  asset purchase agreement with GSK.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on
numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the status of and
results from preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties, and any unforeseen
cash needs.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through the acquisition or in-license of complementary product
candidates. While we have no current agreements or commitments for any specific
acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion of the net
proceeds for these purposes.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. The
timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business.
Pending these uses, for a period of six months after the closing of this
offering, we plan to invest these net proceeds in a non-interest bearing
account. Thereafter, we may choose to invest these net proceeds in short-term,
interest bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States. The goal with
respect to the investment of these net proceeds is capital preservation and
liquidity so that such funds are readily available to fund our operations.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to enable
us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through
2017 and the completion of our Phase 3 pivotal program for RVT-101 and the
submission of our NDA with the FDA for the approval of RVT-101 in the United
States. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be
incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we
currently expect."

€43.5 million), based on the public offering price of $14.888 per ADS and an
exchange rate of $1.1279 per euro, and after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offering that are
payable by us ($49.7 million (€44.1 million) if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional ADSs).

As of March 31, 2015, our liquid assets amounted to €27.8 million. We define
“liquid assets” as cash and cash equivalents together with our financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss, which consists of money market funds. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with a portion of
our current liquid assets (which subsequent to March 31, 2015 includes
€30.3 million in net proceeds from the Convertible Notes Financings) to fund our
Phase 3 double-blind clinical trial (and extension) of tozadenant in Parkinson’s
through completion, which we expect to require an investment of approximately
€75 million, including all related studies that will be performed. We intend to
fund the SYN120 Phase 2a clinical trial in Parkinson’s dementia and the BTT1023
Phase 2 clinical trial in PSC, which we expect to cost approximately €5 million
in total, and other working capital requirements, with our remaining liquid
assets, milestone and royalty revenues from Lundbeck for Selincro, and already
identified non-dilutive sources.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
ongoing status of and results from our clinical trials and other studies, the
level and timing of milestones and royalties received from Lundbeck for our
marketed product, Selincro, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this
offering and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application
of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we might decide to postpone
or not pursue other clinical trials or preclinical activities if the net
proceeds from this offering and our other sources of cash are less than
expected. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in a variety of capital preservation investments, including money
market deposits and investment funds that will be designated as financial
assets at fair value through profit and loss in our consolidated statement
of financial position.

"EVOLENT HEALTH, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/evolent-health-inc-964468-78321,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/evolent-health-inc-964468-78321,424B1,6/8/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10748405,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately
$178,415,000 or approximately $205,687,250 if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, at the initial public offering price of
$17.00 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
Class A common stock, obtain additional capital, facilitate our future access to
the public equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential
partners, improve our competitive position, facilitate the use of our Class A
common stock as consideration for future acquisitions and provide liquidity to
existing members of Evolent Health LLC.

We intend to use all of the net proceeds of this offering to purchase Class A
common units of Evolent Health LLC from Evolent Health LLC at a price per
Class A common unit equal to the public offering price per share of our Class A
Common Stock, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. Upon the
completion of this offering, we will have acquired Class A common units
representing a 69.4% economic interest in Evolent Health LLC (or Class A common
units representing a 70.3% economic interest if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full). We will not retain any of the net proceeds used
to purchase the Class A common units from Evolent Health LLC.

The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option
will be used to purchase a corresponding additional number of Class A common
units from Evolent Health LLC at a price per Class A common unit equal to the
public offering price per share of our Class A common stock, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions.

We expect that Evolent Health LLC will use the net proceeds of this offering
contributed by us for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
Evolent Health LLC will have broad discretion in the application of such
proceeds and may not apply the proceeds effectively. However, as of the date of
this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of these
proceeds for such purposes. Management might not be able to yield a significant
return, or any return, on any investment of these proceeds. You will not have
the opportunity to influence decisions on the use of these proceeds."
DAVIDSTEA INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/davidstea-inc-962037-78037,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/davidstea-inc-962037-78037,424B4,6/8/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10749533,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from our issuance and sale of
2,988,600 common shares in this offering will be approximately US$48.5 million
(or approximately US$56.0 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive
any of the proceeds from the sale of common shares by the selling shareholders.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay the 
full amount outstanding under our term loan agreement with Rainy Day, which we 
refer to as the Shareholder Loan. The Shareholder Loan bears an interest rate of 
4.5% per annum on the daily unpaid balance of the outstanding loan. As of 
January 31, 2015, the principal outstanding on the Shareholder Loan was
approximately $3.0 million. The principal is due in three equal annual
installments, with one payment being due on each of the three dates on which we
make annual redemption payments on our Series A Preferred Shares, which may not
occur earlier than April 3, 2017. If the Series A Preferred Shares are not
redeemed before April 3, 2020, the principal on the loan is due in three annual
installments beginning on April 3, 2020.

In addition, we also intend to use a portion of net proceeds of this offering, 
together with cash on hand, to repay amounts outstanding under the Revolving 
Facility. The Revolving Facility bears interest at a rate of (a) the bank's 
prime rate plus 0.50% to 1.25% per annum, (b) the bank's U.S. base rate plus 
0.50% to 1.25% per annum, (c) LIBOR plus 1.50% to 2.25% per annum, subject to 
availability, or (d) 1.50% to 2.25% on the face amount of each banker's 
acceptance, letter of credit or letter of guarantee, as applicable. The
Revolving Facility matures on April 24, 2018. We used initial borrowings under
the Revolving Facility to pay off indebtedness outstanding as of January 31,
2015.

We expect to use the balance of the net proceeds of this offering for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes. The amounts and timing of our 
actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including that rate at 
which we expand our store base, our operating costs and expenditures and the
amount of cash generated by our operations."
"ENDOCHOICE HOLDINGS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/endochoice-holdings-inc-948923-78332,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/endochoice-holdings-inc-948923-78332,424B4,6/5/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10746832,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $85.1 million (or $94.9 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full), after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate future access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to
use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to fund the commercialization
and continued development of our Fuse® system as follows:

• approximately $29 million for the expansion of our sales and marketing    
  activities, including hiring new direct sales representatives;            

• approximately $27 million for increases in working capital requirements   
  related to accounts receivable and inventory;                             

• approximately $17 million for capital expenditures for new product 
  demonstration equipment, including colon models and other simulation      
  equipment, used by our sales representatives and other personnel for Fuse®
  product demonstrations to GI specialists;                                 

• approximately $4 million for investments to expand our manufacturing      
  capacity as sales of our Fuse® system and other products increase in the  
  future, which will include the acquisition of equipment and other fixed   
  assets related primarily to the manufacturing of our Fuse® system and our 
  other products; and                                                       

• the remainder for other general corporate purposes.

In addition, we may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire and invest
in complementary products, technologies, services or businesses; however, we
currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transaction nor
are we involved in negotiations to do so.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our plans and business condition. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts
that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing
of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors.
As a result, management will have broad discretion in its application of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment in such application.

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering, we may invest in short- and
intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and
cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2019. This
estimate assumes that we will enter into definitive documentation for the $58.0
million Proposed New Credit Facility to replace our existing credit facilities
and increase our borrowing availability. We entered into a commitment letter for
the Proposed New Credit Facility in May 2015. The closing and funding of the
Proposed New Credit Facility is conditioned upon, among other things, our
completion of an initial public offering raising at least $85 million of net
proceeds, however this offering is not conditioned on the availability of the
Proposed New Credit Facility. We cannot be certain that we will enter into the
Proposed New Credit Facility or that the terms and conditions described herein
will be the final terms and conditions if we enter into the Proposed New
Credit Facility. If we fail to finalize and execute definitive documentation for
the Proposed New Credit Facility, our liquidity may be adversely impacted and we
expect that our cash after the completion of this offering and borrowing
availability will only be sufficient to fund our operations until the middle of
2017.

In the event the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares of our common stock in the offering, we will not receive any of the
proceeds from any shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders."
"PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/penntex-midstream-partners-lp-945792-76589,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/penntex-midstream-partners-lp-945792-76589,424B4,6/4/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10745683,"We intend to use the net proceeds of approximately $206.6 million from this
offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts, structuring fee
and offering expenses payable by us or previously incurred by our parent, as
follows:

. approximately $98.7 million to PennTex NLA and approximately $55.3 million to
  MRD WHR LA, in each case, in part, as a reimbursement for certain capital 
  expenditures incurred by such entity with respect to the development of our 
  initial assets;                                         

. $30.5 million to repay in full all outstanding borrowings under PennTex    
  Operating’s existing credit facility, which we will terminate following such 
  repayment; and                                                        

. approximately $22.2 million to fund a portion of the capital expenditures  
  incurred in connection with the construction of our initial assets.        

We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate
of 1,687,500 additional common units to the extent the underwriters sell more
than 11,250,000 common units in this offering. If the underwriters do not
exercise their option to purchase additional common units, we will issue
1,054,687 common units to PennTex Development and 632,813 common units to MRD
WHR LA at the expiration of the option for no additional consideration. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units in full,
the additional net proceeds will be approximately $31.6 million. All of the net
proceeds from any exercise of such option will be used to make additional cash
distributions to each of PennTex Development and MRD WHR LA in proportion to the
respective number of common units each such unitholder would have been entitled
to receive if the underwriters did not exercise such option as set forth above.
Any remaining common units not purchased by the underwriters pursuant to any
exercise of the option will be issued to each of PennTex Development and MRD WHR
LA in proportion to the amounts set forth above for no additional consideration.
Accordingly, the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
units will not affect the total number of units outstanding. If the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units, the ownership
interest of the public unitholders purchasing common units in this offering will
increase to an approximate 32.3% limited partner interest in us.

PennTex Operating utilized its credit facility to develop a portion of our
initial assets. As of May 22, 2015, $30.5 million of borrowings were outstanding
under PennTex Operating’s existing credit facility, with a weighted average
interest rate of 3.53%. In addition, as of May 22, 2015, our parent had $83.0
million of outstanding borrowings under its existing credit facility, with a
weighted average interest rate of 4.48%.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under the existing credit
facilities of PennTex Operating and our parent and, accordingly, will receive a
portion of the proceeds of this offering."
