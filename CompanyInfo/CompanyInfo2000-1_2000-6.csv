be $18.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 
$1.4 million but before deducting expenses incurred in connection with the 
offering. 

At the closing of this offering the following will take place: 

First, our general partner will acquire a portion of the gathering system 
assets from Atlas America, Resource Energy, Viking Resources and their
 subsidiaries engaged in drilling and gas production activities in exchange for 
the assumption of $11.0 million of debt to Resource America's energy affiliates 
(including Atlas America, Resource Energy and Viking Resources) associated with 
those assets. This debt was incurred in connection with the expansion and 
operations of the gathering systems of Atlas America and Resource Energy. The 
debt bears interest at 10% per year and is secured by those gathering system 
assets. Our general partner will then contribute these assets (subject to the 
$11.0 million debt) to the operating partnership in exchange for a 1.0101% 
general partner interest and a limited partner interest. We believe the terms 
of the acquisition are fair, reasonable and comparable to those that could have 
been received in an arm's length transaction with similarly situated persons. 
Second, our general partner will contribute its limited partner interest in the 
operating partnership to us in exchange for 1,641,026 subordinated units and a 
1.0101% general partner interest. The subordinated units were assigned a value 
of $13.00 per unit. 

Third, Atlas America, Resource Energy and Viking Resources will enter into the 
master natural gas gathering agreement and the omnibus agreement with us. 

Fourth, we will issue 1,500,000 common units raising net proceeds of 
approximately $18.1 million and contribute the net proceeds to the operating 
partnership. The operating partnership will retire the $11.0 million of debt 
associated with the gathering system assets, pay $1.0 million to two affiliated 
partnerships from whom a portion of the gathering system assets was acquired, 
and use $4.6 million to acquire the remaining portion of the gathering system 
assets to be acquired from Atlas America, Resource Energy, Viking Resources and 
their subsidiaries. In addition, the operating partnership will reimburse the 
general partner for $750,000 of offering expenses, including filing fees, legal 
and accounting fees, printing costs and fees of petroleum engineers. 

All of the transactions described above will take place at a single closing. We 
will retain the balance of the offering proceeds, approximately $750,000, for 
use as working capital, including to use in acquiring other gathering systems 
in the future. The proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their over-
allotment option will be used to redeem subordinated units."

common stock will be approximately $47,925,000, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds 
will be approximately $55,248,750. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to establish a public market for 
our common stock, to increase our visibility in the marketplace, to facilitate 
future access to public capital markets, to provide liquidity to existing 
stockholders and to obtain additional working capital. 

We currently intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for 
general corporate purposes, including working capital, product development, 
increasing our sales and marketing capabilities and expanding our international 
operations. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest 
in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use 
complementary technologies. We have no specific understandings, commitments or 
agreements relating to an acquisition or investment. Pending these uses, we 
plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-
bearing, investment-grade securities."

stock will be approximately $51,800,000 ($59,500,000 if the underwriters' over-
allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting underwriting discounts 
and our estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any of the net 
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. See ""Principal 
and Selling Stockholders."" 

The principal purposes of this offering are: 

- to enhance our ability to use our common stock as a means of attracting and 
retaining key employees; 

- to raise capital in order to repay bank debt; 

- to pay a termination fee for consulting and advisory services; 

- to provide increased visibility and credibility in the marketplace; 

- to enhance our ability to use our common stock as consideration for 
acquisitions; 

- to increase our equity capital; 

- to facilitate our future access to public capital markets; and 

- to provide liquidity to our existing stockholders. 

We expect to use the net proceeds received from this offering for the repayment 
of bank debt to Fleet Bank, which totaled $2,000,000 at September 30, 1999. The 
credit agreement with Fleet Bank consists of a revolving loan that expires on 
May 31, 2001 and a working capital loan that expires on May 31, 2000 but may be 
extended to May 31, 2001. The interest rate under the loans was 8 1/4% at 
September 30, 1999. $2,187,500 of the proceeds of the Fleet Bank loans were 
used to pay an earnout provision in connection with the acquisition of Zai*Net 
Software, L.P. For a description of the bank debt and the acquisition of 
Zai*Net, see notes 8 and 3 of the Caminus Corporation financial statements. We 
intend to use $1,300,000 of the net proceeds to pay GFI as consideration for 
terminating its consulting and advisory arrangements with us. Additionally, we 
expect to use approximately $476,000 for a special bonus payment to the former 
shareholders of Caminus Limited. We intend to use the remainder of the net 
proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including 
possible acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies. See ""Certain 
Transactions."" 

From time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition 
candidates. However, we have no current plans, commitments or agreements with 
respect to any acquisitions, and we may not make any acquisitions. 

Except as described above, we have not identified specific uses for the net 
proceeds of this offering, and we will have discretion over their use and 
investment. Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest these proceeds 
in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing instruments."

underwriters exercise their over allotment option in full, our net proceeds 
will be approximately $116.8 million. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our working capital, to 
fund both capital investment and research and development and other general 
corporate purposes. See ""Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."" Pending 
any use of the net proceeds for the above purposes, we intend to invest the

estimated capital expenditures of approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2000 and 
increased facility rent of approximately $1.0 million per year commencing 
January 1, 2000, we have not identified specific uses for the net proceeds from 
this offering. We will invest a portion of the proceeds to accelerate research 
and development relating to our products based on the Internet Protocol and our 
development of new products utilizing the future wireless standard. The amounts 
we actually expend in these areas may vary significantly and will depend on a 
number of factors, including our future revenues. Accordingly, management will 
retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering.

information on which we base our decisions on how to use the proceeds."

option.) This is based on the initial public offering price after deducting the 
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will 
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares being sold by the selling 
stockholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering as 
follows: 

- to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities 
(approximately $32.9 million as of September 30, 1999); and 

- to apply the balance to general corporate purposes, including the pending 
acquisitions of ESI and MPE. The pending acquisitions will require 
approximately $9.8 million. To the extent the proceeds from this offering are 
not sufficient to fund these acquisitions, we will borrow the additional funds 
under our revolving credit facility. 

Pending use for these purposes, we plan to invest the net proceeds in short-
term investment-grade securities. 

The weighted average interest rate for outstanding borrowings under our credit 
facilities as of September 30, 1999 was 7.9%. The term loan portion of one of 
our credit facilities is payable in quarterly installments through November 
2003. The revolving portion of that credit facility matures on November 30, 
2001. The other credit facility matures on July 23, 2002. We used borrowings 
under our credit facilities to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures and 
for general corporate purposes."

initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses of $9,700,000 payable by 
PCA. 

PCA will use the net proceeds to redeem all outstanding shares of its 12 3/8% 
senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010 (1,058,094 shares as of January 1, 
2000) at a redemption price of 112.375% of its liquidation preference, plus 
accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption. If the redemption 
occurred on March 3, 2000, the redemption price would be 112.375% of 
$105,809,400, plus $5,564,913 of accrued and unpaid dividends, or $124,468,226. 

Any net proceeds received by PCA in excess of the amounts required to redeem 
the outstanding senior exchangeable preferred stock will be used to pay down 
debt or for general corporate purposes, including working capital. Any proceeds 
used to pay down debt would be applied ratably to the following term loans 
oustanding under PCA's senior credit facility:

outstanding as of December 31, 1999. 

PCA entered into the senior credit facility on April 12, 1999. The proceeds of 
the loans made under the senior credit facility were used to finance a portion 
of the transactions and related expenses, to refinance outstanding indebtedness 
and liabilities and for general corporate purposes including working capital. 

PCA will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by the

We intend to use approximately $60.0 million of the net proceeds of the global 
offering to repay debt, $50.0 million of which was incurred in 1998 and used to 
refinance other debt and $10.0 million of which was incurred in December 1999 
and used for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 1999, this 
indebtedness consisted of: 

- $25.0 million from Den Danske Bank in a short-term loan maturing on August 
26, 2000 and bearing interest at a rate of 0.6% per annum above the London 
Inter Bank Offering Rate for U.S. dollars. This rate was 6.0% per annum as of 
September 30, 1999; 

- $10.0 million from Den Danske Bank in a short-term loan maturing on February 
16, 2000 and bearing interest at a rate of 6.85% per annum; and 

- $25.0 million from ST Treasury Services Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Singapore Technologies, in a demand loan bearing interest at a rate of 
5.8% per annum as of September 30, 1999. 

We plan to use the remainder of the net proceeds to fund capital expenditures, 
including the purchase of test and assembly equipment, working capital and 
general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or investments. The 
amounts that we actually expend for the purposes of capital expenditures will 
vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including general economic 
conditions in the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by end-users 
of semiconductors. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in allocating 
the remainder of the net proceeds of the global offering. 

From time to time we may acquire or make investments in additional businesses, 
products and technologies or establish joint ventures or strategic partnerships 
that we believe will complement our current and future business. Some of these 
acquisitions or investments could be material. However, we have no specific 
agreements or undertakings with respect to any material acquisition or 
investment at this time. 

Pending the uses described above, we will invest the net proceeds in short-term
 investments."

full) after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated 
expenses of the offering. We intend to contribute approximately $1,502.6 
million of net proceeds to John Hancock Life Insurance Company. 

The Plan of Reorganization requires us to contribute all of the net cash 
proceeds of the offering to John Hancock Life Insurance Company other than a 
working capital allowance of $50.0 million plus an amount determined by John 
Hancock Financial Services, Inc. to be reasonably necessary to provide for 
regular cash dividends to stockholders in the year following the effective 
date. We expect that the amount of net proceeds to be retained by John Hancock 
Financial Services, Inc. will total $150.0 million. John Hancock Financial 
Services, Inc. intends to use these net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
and to pay a dividend to the stockholders of John Hancock Financial Services, 
Inc. in the year following the effective date of the reorganization. However, 
provisions of our Plan of Reorganization may serve to reduce the amount 
retained to an amount less than $150.0 million, unless specific approval is 
received from the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance. If this amount is 
reduced, John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. may require additional funds, to 
be obtained through dividends from John Hancock Life Insurance Company or 
borrowings, in order to pay the first year stockholder dividend, if declared. 

In connection with the reorganization, John Hancock Life Insurance Company will 
require funds to satisfy the following needs, which will be satisfied with a 
combination of internal funds and cash contributed by John Hancock Financial 
Services, Inc. As of the date hereof: 

(1) $60.0 million is estimated to be required for the cost of a portion of the 
nonrecurring expenses of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company directly 
related to the transaction; 

(2) $1,381.9 million is estimated to be used to make cash payments to eligible 
policyholders; and 

(3) $52.2 million is estimated to be necessary to establish reserves for policy 
credits to eligible policyholders. 

In addition to the shares of our common stock distributed in the offering, for 
which we will receive cash proceeds, many eligible policyholders will receive 
shares of common stock as compensation for extinguishment of their membership 
interests in the reorganization. Neither John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. 
nor John Hancock Life Insurance Company will receive any proceeds from the 
issuance of our common stock to eligible policyholders as compensation for the 
extinguishment of their membership interests in connection with the

regular cash dividends to stockholders in the year following the effective 
date. We expect that the amount of net proceeds to be retained by John Hancock 
Financial Services, Inc. will total $150.0 million. John Hancock Financial 
Services, Inc. intends to use these net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
and to pay a dividend to the stockholders of John Hancock Financial Services, 
Inc. in the year following the effective date of the reorganization. However, 
provisions of our Plan of Reorganization may serve to reduce the amount 
retained to an amount less than $150.0 million, unless specific approval is 
received from the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance. If this amount is 
reduced, John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. may require additional funds, to 
be obtained through dividends from John Hancock Life Insurance Company or 
borrowings, in order to pay the first year stockholder dividend, if declared. 

In connection with the reorganization, John Hancock Life Insurance Company will 
require funds to satisfy the following needs, which will be satisfied with a 
combination of internal funds and cash contributed by John Hancock Financial 
Services, Inc. As of the date hereof: 

(1) $60.0 million is estimated to be required for the cost of a portion of the 
nonrecurring expenses of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company directly 
related to the transaction; 

(2) $1,381.9 million is estimated to be used to make cash payments to eligible 
policyholders; and 

(3) $52.2 million is estimated to be necessary to establish reserves for policy 
credits to eligible policyholders. 

In addition to the shares of our common stock distributed in the offering, for 
which we will receive cash proceeds, many eligible policyholders will receive 
shares of common stock as compensation for extinguishment of their membership 
interests in the reorganization. Neither John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. 
nor John Hancock Life Insurance Company will receive any proceeds from the 
issuance of our common stock to eligible policyholders as compensation for the 
extinguishment of their membership interests in connection with the 
reorganization."

us at the initial public offering price of $20.00 per share, after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses, are estimated to be approximately $72.7 million, or approximately 
$83.9 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. 

We do not have specific uses committed for the preponderance of the net 
proceeds of this offering. The size of the offering has been determined 
primarily based upon our desire to raise a sufficient amount of capital to 
afford to us significant business flexibility in the future. 

The principal purposes of this offering are: 

- to obtain additional working capital; 

- to create a public market for our common stock; 

- to facilitate future access by Extensity to public equity markets; and 

- to enhance our ability to use our stock to make future acquisitions due to 
the fact that our shares will be publicly traded. 

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay in 
full outstanding indebtedness to Comdisco Ventures of approximately $1.8 
million under a loan and security agreement and approximately $1.3 million 
under various capital leases. Indebtedness under the loan and security 
agreement has been accruing interest at fixed rates ranging from 11.32% to 
11.5% and matures through March 25, 2001, and indebtedness under the capital 
leases accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from 7.03% to 7.42% and mature at 
various dates from March 2002 to July 2003. 

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital and 
general corporate purposes, including increased spending on sales and marketing,
 customer support, research and development, expansion of our operational and 
administrative infrastructure, and the leasing of additional facilities. In 
addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, product lines or products. However, we 
have no current plans, agreements or commitments with respect to any such 
acquisition, and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect 
to any such transaction. 

Based on our current business model, we expect that we will spend approximately 
$32.8 million of the net proceeds of this offering on sales and marketing, 
$15.3 million on research and development, $15.3 million on service and 
maintenance, and $6.2 million on general and administrative costs. These 
figures are subject to change, however, depending upon our rate of revenue 
growth, overall financial performance and evolving business needs. These 
expectations may prove to be inaccurate, as our financial performance may 
differ from our current expectations or our business needs may change as our 
business model and the industry we address evolve. As a result, the proceeds we 
receive from this offering may be used in a manner significantly different from 
our current allocation plans. Pending use, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities, certificates of 
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. 

The amounts we actually spend for these purposes may vary significantly and 
will depend on a number of factors, including our future revenue and cash 
generated by operations and the other factors described in ""Risk Factors."" 
Therefore, we will have broad discretion in the way we use the net proceeds."

million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), at 
the initial public offering price of $11.00 per share and after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable 
by us. The principal reasons for this offering are to provide working capital, 
to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future 
access to public capital markets. 

We expect to use $10,250,000 of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the 
first year fees due to Snap under our strategic alliance agreement with Snap. 
We have also agreed to pay Snap up to an additional $5.0 million in the first 
year if Snap delivers more than a minimum number of click-throughs to the co-
branded Snap/HealthGate Web site and would expect to use a portion of the net 
proceeds to pay this additional fee. 

We expect to use $2,000,000 of the net proceeds of this offering to repay all 
of the indebtedness outstanding under a subordinated note. This note bears 
interest at the fixed rate of 13% per year and is scheduled to mature on March 
26, 2003. 

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds of this offering for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital, but we have no current plan for 
the amounts we may spend on any specific aspect of our business or the timing 
of these expenditures. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the 
acquisition of or investment in companies, technologies or assets that 
complement our business. However, we have no present understandings, 
commitments or agreements with respect to any potential acquisitions or 
investments. As a result, our management will have broad discretion to allocate 
the net proceeds from this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds of this offering in short term, investment grade, interest 
bearing instruments."

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate future access to

the net proceeds of this offering for specific uses. We intend to use our net 
proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. The actual amounts 
expended for specific purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of 
factors, including cash generated from operations, if any, changes in the 
competitive landscape, demands of customers, and the extent and timing of our 
entry into target markets. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for 
acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies that complement our 
business. Although we have evaluated possible acquisitions from time to time, 
we currently have no commitments or agreements to make any acquisitions, and

The marketing costs will consist of: 

o advertising, 

o general promotional activities, 

o creation and distribution of CD-ROMs, 

o attendance at trade shows and conventions, 

o follow-up with prospective vendors and customers, and 

o the personnel costs associated with those functions 

The proceeds will be used to repay promissory notes executed in August 1999 in 
the aggregate principal amount of $375,000. The principal amount of the 
promissory notes has been used for general working capital and to pay for 
expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of the division from 
Laminaire and expenses related to this offering. 

We anticipate paying an aggregate of $200,000 to Kimberly-Clark Corporation, 
The Texwipe Company LLC and Alma, Inc., three of our suppliers, as required 
under our guarantees of the obligations of Laminaire. We issued these 
guarantees as part of our acquisition of the distribution division of 
Laminaire. We anticipate that Laminaire will not pay these vendors because of 
its cash flow limitations and that we will make these payments at the closing 
of the offering. We will deduct any amounts paid under the guarantees from the 
amounts owed by us to Laminaire under the promissory notes in the aggregate 
principal amount of $500,000 issued when we acquired the distribution division 
of Laminaire. The remaining amounts due under the notes will be 

o paid from revenues generated by operations, 

o refinanced from other sources, or 

o reduced by cancellation of a note due from Laminaire in the principal amount 
of $102,000. 

Website development will include ongoing enhancements to our site as well as 
assisting vendors and other strategic partners in developing material for our 
site. 

Working capital will include salaries, rent and administrative expenses and 
inventory financing. A portion of working capital will be used to satisfy 
approximately $125,000 in 

obligations to vendors, assumed in the purchase of the distribution division 
from Laminaire. 
This allocation is only an estimate and we may adjust it as necessary to 
address our operational needs in the future. For instance, we may use a portion 
of the net proceeds to acquire complementary technologies or businesses. 
However, we have no commitments or agreements and are not involved in any 
negotiations to purchase any technology or businesses. 

We reserve the right to reallocate proceeds to different uses, including ways 
which differ from the specific proposed uses described in this prospectus if 
management determines the needs of the business so require. In addition, a 
large portion of the proceeds is allocated to discretionary purposes. Investors 
may not agree with the allocation or reallocation. Based on our operating plan, 
we believe that the net proceeds of this offering, together with available 
funds on hand and cash flow from future operations, will be sufficient to 
satisfy our working capital requirements for at least 12 months following this 
offering. Our belief is based upon assumptions, including assumptions about our 
contemplated operations and economic and industry conditions. If we are able to 
make significant acquisitions for cash consideration, we would require 
additional capital. In addition, contingencies may arise that may require us to 
obtain additional capital. 

We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain additional capital on 
favorable terms or at all. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we 
intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment 
grade securities or similar quality investments."

our stock in order to attract and retain qualified employees. In addition, we 
believe that becoming a public company may provide increased name recognition 
in our customer market.

and estimated offering expenses from the sale of 2,000,000 shares of common 
stock will be approximately $58.1 million, given an initial offering price of 
$32.00. If the underwriters' over-allotment is exercised in full, we estimate 
our net proceeds will be approximately $67.0 million. We expect to use the net 
proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, principally for 
working capital and capital expenditures. Additionally, we may use an 
undetermined portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary 
companies, if suitable opportunities arise and if the acquisition targets or 
investment opportunities are consistent with our vision of the future for our 
company and our culture. We have no current plans, agreements, or commitments 
and are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to any such 
transaction. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short- 
term, investment grade securities or money market instruments. Management will 
have significant discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from this 
offering. For additional information on the risks involved in our use of 
proceeds see ""Risk Factors--Because we have no immediate plans for the proceeds 
of this offering nor do we require them for current operations, we will use 
them at our discretion in the future, without stockholder approval"" on page 10."

million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately 
$75.5 million. 

We plan to use approximately $3.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering 
to repay existing indebtedness owed under our existing secured credit facility 
and approximately $20.0 million of the proceeds to repay the subordinated notes 
we issued in October 1999. The secured credit facility bears interest at prime 
plus 3.5% per annum, compounded annually, and is due in January 2001. The 
subordinated notes bear interest at 12% per annum, compounded quarterly, and 
are due upon the closing of this offering. We plan to use $7.5 million to $9.0 
million of the remaining net proceeds to increase the size of our sales and 
marketing organization, and $1.5 million to $2.0 million to expand research and 
development efforts in order to enhance the functionality of our solutions 
platform. We anticipate using the remaining net proceeds for working capital 
and for general corporate purposes, including international expansion. In 
addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to make 
strategic acquisitions of companies or technology. We are not currently a party 
to any discussions with respect to any acquisitions. 

As of the date of this prospectus, other than with respect to the debt 
repayment described above, we have no specific plan detailing the expected 
amount of the proceeds to be used for each of the purposes described above and 
cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds to be 
received upon completion of this offering. The actual amounts and timing of 
these expenditures will vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
including, but not limited to, the amount of cash used in or generated by our 
operations. Our management will have discretion over the use and investment of 
the net proceeds of this offering. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment 
grade securities until they are used."

common stock will be approximately $131.1 million, or $151.0 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses of $1.8 million payable by us. 

We will use a portion of the net proceeds to repay any outstanding amounts 
under our credit facility. Indebtedness under this credit facility as of 
December 31, 1999 was approximately $51.5 million, which we incurred to finance 
the Atlantic Connections acquisition and for general corporate purposes. This 
facility matures on November 3, 2007 and, on December 31, 1999, bore interest 
at a weighted average rate of approximately 10.8%. We expect to use 
approximately $1.7 million of the net proceeds in connection with the 
acquisition of a corporation engaged in Internet home page design and 
development. The total purchase price of the acquisition is approximately $4.1 
million. See ""Business--Business Strategy--Accelerate Growth through 
Acquisitions."" We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds for capital 
expenditures relating to our planned expansion and working capital and other 
general corporate purposes, including possible future investments, acquisitions 
or strategic alliances. Pending such uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds 
in investment grade, interest-bearing securities."

3.7 million common shares at the initial public offering price of $22.00 per 
share after deducting underwriting commissions and discounts of $5.7 million 
and estimated expenses of $1.5 million. If the underwriters exercise their over-
allotment option in full, then the net proceeds will be approximately $79.9 
million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the 
selling shareholder. 

$8.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering will be used to repay debt. 
Of the $8.0 million, (1) $1.5 million will be used to repay subordinated 
convertible promissory notes with a stated interest rate of 10% per annum which 
mature on the earlier to occur of May 12, 2000 or our initial public offering, 
(2) $5.0 million will be used to repay a secured bridge loan with a stated 
interest rate of 9.25% per annum which matures on March 31, 2000 and (3) the 
remaining $1.5 million will be used to repay a portion of the amount 
outstanding under our revolving credit facility which has a stated interest 
rate of the prime rate plus 1.25% per annum and matures on March 16, 2000. See 
""Certain Transactions"" on page 50 and ""Underwriting"" on page 60 for more 
information regarding the subordinated convertible promissory notes and the 
secured bridge loan. After application of the net proceeds of this offering, 
$2.2 million will remain outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We 
currently estimate that we will use the balance of the net proceeds of this 
offering as follows: 

. 11% for research and development; 

. 11% for expansion of our sales channels; 

. 9% for increased marketing programs; 

. 2% for capital expenditures; and 

. 67% for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

The amounts described above reflect our estimate of the use of our net proceeds 
from this offering, based on our current plans for anticipated expenditures. 
Our actual expenditures may vary significantly from these estimates based upon 
a number of factors, including the progress or results of our marketing 
programs, changing technologies, shifts in client demand and success of our 
sales channels. As a result, we may find it necessary or advisable to 
reallocate the net proceeds within the uses outlined above or to use portions 
of the net proceeds for other purposes. Accordingly, our management will have 
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering. 

Pending any use, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-
term, interest bearing investment grade securities."

underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. 

We intend to use approximately $29.0 million of the proceeds from this offering 
for advertising and marketing to increase brand awareness and to attract 
consumers to our marketplace. We intend to use the balance of the offering 
proceeds for general corporate purposes. 

We currently estimate that we will spend approximately $50.0 million during 
2000 on marketing and advertising, more than double what we spent in 1999. Our 
marketing expenses will be funded from the proceeds of the offering, our 
current cash on hand, and revenue generated from our operations. The amount we 
actually spend for this purpose will depend on a number of factors, including 
the growth of our consumer base, the types of efforts we make to build our 
brand and competitive developments in the home mortgage and consumer credit 
markets. Therefore, we cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of the 
net proceeds of this offering. Accordingly, management will have significant 
flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. 
Pending any use, we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term,
 investment grade, interest-bearing securities. 

From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate possible 
acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, or 
products that are complementary to our business. We are currently evaluating 
the possible minority equity investment in several companies offering 
complementary services. None of these potential investments are currently 
considered to be pending or probable. A portion of the net proceeds may be used

estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable

Of the net proceeds of this offering we expect to pay an aggregate of 
approximately $129 million to Bridge. Of this amount, approximately $66 million 
will represent the portion of the purchase price of Bridge's Internet protocol 
network assets not subject to capital leases, approximately $5 million will be 
used to reduce existing outstanding debt to Bridge and approximately $58 
million will be paid to Bridge as a preferential distribution. As of December 
31, 1999, we had approximately $25 million of outstanding debt to Bridge 
consisting of term notes maturing one year after the completion of this 
offering, bearing interest at 8% per annum, the proceeds of which were used for 
working capital purposes. The remaining net proceeds will be used for operating 
expenses, capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. We also may 
use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for acquisitions or 
investments. We have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any 
material capital expenditures, acquisitions or investments. Pending the 
application of the proceeds towards one of the uses described above, we intend 
to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade

We will purchase Bridge's Internet protocol network assets simultaneously with

the acquisition of those assets and our and Bridge's entering into the network 
services agreement.

We currently anticipate that approximately $8 million of the proceeds of this 
offering may be used for potential acquisitions. However, while we continually 
evaluate acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that any 
acquisition will be completed or that any of the proceeds will be used for 
acquisitions. Conversely, we may spend more than $8 million on acquisitions if 
appropriate opportunities are available. We do not currently have any material 
acquisitions that are probable. 

We plan to use approximately $60,413 of the proceeds of this offering to pay 
compensation deferred by ten members of our management team. For a full 
description of these salary deferments, see ""Management--Executive 
Compensation."" 

Final allocation of proceeds depends on numerous factors, including amounts 
spent on acquisitions, growth of our business and the need for additional 
marketing and development activities. A substantial portion of the net proceeds 
have not been allocated to any specific use. We will continue to retain broad 
discretion over actual use of proceeds. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest 
bearing investment securities, such as government-backed treasuries."

We currently anticipate that approximately $8 million of the proceeds of this 
offering may be used for potential acquisitions. However, while we continually 
evaluate acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that any 
acquisition will be completed or that any of the proceeds will be used for 
acquisitions. Conversely, we may spend more than $8 million on acquisitions if 
appropriate opportunities are available. We do not currently have any material 
acquisitions that are probable. 

We plan to use approximately $60,413 of the proceeds of this offering to pay 
compensation deferred by ten members of our management team. For a full 
description of these salary deferments, see ""Management--Executive 
Compensation."" 

Final allocation of proceeds depends on numerous factors, including amounts 
spent on acquisitions, growth of our business and the need for additional 
marketing and development activities. A substantial portion of the net proceeds 
have not been allocated to any specific use. We will continue to retain broad 
discretion over actual use of proceeds. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest 
bearing investment securities, such as government-backed treasuries."

Advertising and Promotions. We plan to engage in an aggressive marketing campaign
 to establish the Jeremy's Microbatch(R) brand name and to obtain more retail
 outlets. Marketing and promotions include marketing directly to retailers
 through promotional programs and allowances, in store sampling and other 
promotional programs. We will also engage in direct consumer marketing including
 sponsorships of events and advertising activities such as print and broadcast
 advertising and coupons. 

Retail Placement, or ""Slotting,"" Fees. These fees are required by certain 
supermarkets, grocers and other retail customers for our product to obtain and 
maintain shelf space in their freezers. 

Repayment of Notes Payable. This amount includes the following: 

o $300,000 owed to a bank 
o $40,000 owed to our Chief Executive Officer 
o $5,000 owed to our Chief Financial Officer 
o $50,000 owed to Strive, Inc., one of our principal members 
o approximately $235,000 owed to our former marketing agency 

The bank debt is a line of credit from Norwest Bank. The borrowings on the line
 of credit were used for working capital, including salaries and inventory. This
 loan bears interest at 12.25% per annum. 

The loans by the President and Chief Financial Officer were made in October, 
1999, to allow us to repay a debt owed to an unrelated party who had made a 
$50,000 loan to us in December, 1998. The interest rate on the loans to our
 officers is 10% per annum. The interest on the loan from the unrelated party 
had been 14% per annum. These notes by their terms are not due until October,
 2000, but we plan to repay them upon closing of this offering to avoid the 
interest charges. 

The loan by Strive, Inc, was made in November, 1999 to fund the payment of
 accounts payable. That note bears interest at 14% and is due in October, 2000
 but we plan to repay it upon closing of the offering. 
The debt to our former marketing agency consists of a note we issued to that
 agency on November 19, 1999. That note represents amounts due for past services
 and expenses of the marketing agency. 

Repayment of Obligations to Former Manufacturer. Approximately $110,000 of the
 amount owed to our former manufacturer is for finished product previously
 delivered and approximately $90,000 is for ice cream ingredients and packaging 
materials on hand at the time we terminated the manufacturer. The remaining 
amounts represent interest and other costs. When we pay these amounts, we will 
receive the packaging and ingredients. We expect to utilize a majority of those
 materials and ingredients. 

Working Capital. This amount will be used for costs and expenses until we are
 able to fund these costs and expenses through operations. These costs and 
expenses will be incurred or already have been incurred for salaries and benefits 
for employees and management, including three new marketing employees we 
recently hired, and other customary overhead expenses. These costs also 
The amounts in the table above are estimates developed by our management based
 upon our current plans and current economic and industry conditions. Our 
proposed use of proceeds may change if industry or economic conditions change 
or if our financial condition changes. Management will also have the discretion
 to change the amount of funds used for each purpose. 

Pending use of the proceeds, as described above, funds will be held in 
temporary investments in bank certificates of deposits and/or interest-bearing 
insured savings accounts, United States government notes, bills and bonds and 
money market funds. Any income derived from the short-term investments will be
 used for working capital."

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the net

will reflect underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses payable 
by us. We estimate that these discounts, commissions and expenses will be an 
aggregate of approximately $3,936,000 or $4,416,000, if the over-allotment 
option is fully exercised.

We intend to use approximately $18,000,000 of the net proceeds for sales and 
marketing activities and operations. An important part of these activities will 
be the development of the ""b2bstores.com"" brand and promotion of our web site
 and product and service offerings. These activities include: 

o the advertising of our web site in trade journals and magazines, 

o direct mailings to businesses, 

o online marketing initiatives, 

o the appointment of one or more advertising agencies, 

o the hiring of sales and marketing personnel, and 

o the making of up-front payments that may be required by fulfillment agents 
prior to their actual delivery of products to our customers. 

We intend to use approximately $2,500,000 of the proceeds for the continued 
technological development of our web site, including: 

o the in-house development of software and related technologies, 

o the hiring of design and technology personnel, 

o the purchase or leasing of hardware and third-party technologies that we 
believe will enhance our web site's ease of use and sense of community, 

o the expansion of our customer support operations, including our 24-hour 
customer service telephone operations and live, online customer service chat
 area, and 

o the commercial launch and expansion of our auction capabilities and 
offerings, business referral services and business content offerings. 

We will use approximately $1,500,000 of the net proceeds to repay loans made to 
us by Enviro-Clean, one of our principal stockholders. These loans were made in 
the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,400,000 in June, July, 
November and December 1999 and January and February 2000. They bear interest at 
the annual rate of 8%. All principal and interest is payable by us on the the 
date this offering is consummated. 
We will use approximately $130,000 of the net proceeds to pay cash bonuses to 
some of our officers. These payments are required under their employment 
agreements. 

We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. These purposes may include: 

o the payment of salaries of additional management and back-office personnel, 

o expenditures of capital for the expansion of our financial and accounting 
infrastructure; and 

o consideration paid for acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances 
domestically or abroad which have not yet been identified. 

Our management will have broad discretion in allocating the proceeds to be 
applied for working capital and general corporate purposes. If the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we intend to use the net proceeds 
from the sale of the shares sold under of the over-allotment option for working 
capital and general corporate purposes. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in: 

o short-term, interest-bearing investment grade securities, 

o money market accounts, 

o certificates of deposit, or 

o direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States government."

the 4,500,000 shares of our common stock in this offering, at an initial public 
offering price of $18.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions, and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters' over-
allotment options are exercised in full, our net proceeds will be approximately 
$81.3 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of shares in this offering for 
additional working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the 
payment of our outstanding bank lines of credit. As of December 31, 1999, the 
outstanding balance of our lines of credit was $2.4 million. We have not yet 
determined our expected use of the remaining portion of these proceeds, but we 
currently estimate that we will incur at least $32.6 million in operating 
expenses during the next twelve months as we increase our investments in our 
business. These operating expenses will be partially offset by revenues 
received from the licensing of our product. 

The amounts and timing of expenditures will vary depending on factors including 
the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological 
developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. We will retain 
broad discretion in the allocation of our net proceeds from the sale of shares 
in this offering. Pending the uses described above, we will invest the net 
proceeds of this offering in short term interest bearing, investment-grade 
securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds will be invested to yield a 
favorable return. We believe that our available cash, together with our net 
proceeds of this offering, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements 
for at least the next twelve months.

estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

      We estimate that we will use approximately $53.7 million of the net 
proceeds from the offering to reduce borrowings outstanding under our credit 
facility. We will also use approximately $44.0 million of the net proceeds from 
the offering to repay indebtedness we owe to members of the Beasley family and 
affiliated companies. That $44.0 million payment is net of the repayment to us 
at the closing of approximately $9.7 million of indebtedness owed to us by 
members of the Beasley family, including approximately $1.0 million of accrued 
and unpaid interest. 

      As of December 31, 1999, we would have had an outstanding balance under

credit facility of $48.7 million for future acquisitions and other corporate 
purposes after giving effect to:

applicable to our credit facility was approximately 8.625%. The credit facility 
expires on December 31, 2006. 

      The obligations we owe to Mr. Beasley and affiliated companies bear 
interest at rates ranging from zero to 9.25% per year and either mature in 2004 
or are payable on demand. For a more detailed description, see “Certain

capital markets. We currently expect to use the net proceeds of this offering
primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes, including
marketing and brand building efforts, capital expenditures associated with the
expansion and building of distribution centers, and technology and system
upgrades. We are in the process of building a second distribution center which
will require capital investments in facilities and equipment of $7 million to $9
million. We have not yet determined the actual expected expenditures and thus
cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each of these purposes. The amounts
and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors,
including the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and
technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. In
addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for further development of
our product lines through acquisitions of products, technologies and businesses.
Accordingly, although we have no present commitments or agreements with respect
to any such acquisitions, management will have significant discretion in
applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending such uses, we will invest
the net proceeds in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities."

           The primary purposes of this offering are to obtain additional 
equity capital, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate 
future access to public markets. We expect to use the net proceeds for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital improvements. For 
example, we expect capital expenditures through December 31, 2000 will be 
between $8.0 million and $13.0 million. We may also use a portion of the net 
proceeds for the acquisition of businesses that are complementary to ours. We 
have no current loans, agreements or commitments and are not currently engaged 
in any negotiations with respect to any transaction. Pending these uses, we 
will invest the net proceeds of this offering in investment grade, interest-

be approximately $79 million. 

    We plan to use the proceeds of this offering for the following: 

• 
To repay $10,000,000 of outstanding principal plus approximately $100,000 of 
accrued interest under a promissory note held by Robert P. Cummins, a principal 
stockholder. This note bears interest at an annual rate of 12% and matures on 
August 18, 2004. 


• 
To redeem 30,000 shares of our redeemable preferred stock at an aggregate 
redemption price of $30,000,000 plus accumulated and unpaid dividends of 
approximately $4,060,000 as of September 30, 1999. We are required to redeem 
all of our redeemable preferred stock upon the closing of this offering. 
Dividends are mandatory and cumulative at an annual rate of 8%. Beneficial 
owners of our redeemable preferred stock include Gary R. Holland, our chief 
executive officer and a director of Fargo, entities affiliated with TA 
Associates, Inc. and St. Paul Venture Capital, Inc., both of which have 
representation on our board of directors, and Robert P. Cummins, Fargo's 
founder and a principal stockholder. See ""Certain Transactions—Conversion and 
Redemption of Preferred Stock"" on page 48 and ""Principal Stockholders"" on pages 
51 and 52. 


• 
To repay approximately $24,000,000 of outstanding principal and approximately 
$898,000 of accrued interest as of September 30, 1999 under our senior credit 
facility with a syndicate of banks led by BankBoston N.A. Approximately, 
$27,000,000 will remain outstanding under this credit facility after the 
repayment described above. The bank debt bears interest at variable rates 
based on either the bank's base rate or the eurodollar rate. During the first 
nine months of 1999 the weighted average annual interest rate on the debt has 
been 8.3%. The bank credit facility is composed of a revolving credit loan and 
a term loan that mature on February 18, 2003 and a term loan that matures 
February 18, 2004. 


    The balance of the proceeds will be used for general working capital 
purposes. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds of the offering in short-term, interest-bearing securities. We have no 
current arrangements, commitments or understandings to acquire any business."

- to fund additional expansions of the FLAG Telecom network, including possible 
additional undersea cables such as a trans-Pacific cable, and to develop 
additional wholesale and bundled product and service offerings; and 

- for working capital and general corporate purposes.

FLAG Limited's existing credit facility provides for borrowing capacity of up 
to $370 million, of which approximately $190 million was outstanding as of 
January 1, 2000. The existing credit facility consists of a seven year $320 
million term loan facility and a seven year $50 million revolving credit 
facility, each bearing interest at a rate of 190 to 212.5 basis points over 
LIBOR. At January 1, 2000, all outstanding indebtedness under this credit 
facility was outstanding under the term loan facility. On January 14, 2000, we 
received an indication of willingness from Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and 
Barclays Capital, as co-arrangers, to modify FLAG Limited's existing credit 
facility to consist of a $150 million, six-year term loan facility and a $10 
million, revolving credit facility. Under the terms of this proposal, these 
facilities would bear interest at a rate of 225 basis points over LIBOR for the 
first six months and thereafter at a rate of between 150 and 250 basis points 
over LIBOR, depending on FLAG Limited's credit rating. In connection with this 
amendment, FLAG Limited would be required to pay fees and expenses to the co-
arrangers totalling approximately $3.5 million. The commitments of the co- 
arrangers would also be subject to satisfaction of various conditions, 
including successful completion of business, engineering and legal due 
diligence, receipt of internal credit approvals, conclusion of definitive 
documentation, successful completion of this offering and no material adverse 
changes to FLAG Limited or to the financial markets generally. The borrowings

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the proceeds of 
the offering based upon the present state of our business, operations and 
plans, and current business conditions. We will have broad discretion to 
determine the use of a substantial portion of the proceeds of the offering. 
Conditions may develop which could cause us to reallocate proceeds from the 
categories listed above. These conditions include difficulties encountered in 
further development of our smart card products and technology and marketing of 
these products, and changes in economic climate. We cannot predict with any 
degree of certainty the occurrence of these conditions. Any reallocation will
 be at the discretion of our board of directors. 

We believe that the net proceeds of the offering, combined with the cash and 
cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and operating 
requirements for the next 12 months. Pending use of the net proceeds, we will 
invest the net proceeds in federally insured or guaranteed securities."

$116.6 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in 
full), at the initial public offering price of $20.00 per share and after 
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses. 

While we cannot predict with certainty how the proceeds of this offering will 
be used, we currently intend to use them as follows: 

- to expand our corporate infrastructure, using approximately $30 million; 

- to repay $4.0 million of outstanding debt as of September 30, 1999 under our 
revolving credit facility with Omnicom Group, which will own 24.7% of our 
common stock after the offering; and 

- for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures of 
approximately $25.0 million and working capital of approximately $42.2 
million. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses or obtain the right to use complementary 
technologies. However, we have no current commitments or agreements with 
respect to any of these types of investments. Pending these uses, the net 
proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing investments or accounts. 

Our revolving credit facility with Omnicom Group bears interest at a rate 
equal to the lender's commercial paper rate, based on the published 30 day 
commercial lending rate in The Wall Street Journal at the last day of the 
month, plus 3.0% on borrowings up to $30.0 million until the closing of this 
offering. After the offering, we may borrow up to $15.0 million at the 
lender's commercial paper rate plus 1.25% through September 30, 2002. The 
interest rate on our borrowings under this facility as of September 30, 1999 
was 6.4%. 

The amounts we actually spend for the above purposes may vary significantly and 
will depend on a number of factors, including our future revenues and cash 
generated by operations and the other factors described under ""Risk Factors"". 
Therefore, we will have broad discretion in the way we use the net proceeds."

matures in July 2001, and the other of which accrues interest at a rate equal 
to the prime rate plus 1.25% and matures in August 2001; and

offered by us at the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share (after 
deducting estimated underwriting discounts, the underwriters' non-accountable 
expense allowance and other estimated offering expenses payable by us), are 
estimated to be $31.6 million (and an additional $4.9 million from the sale of 
shares if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). 

The net proceeds of the offering will be used for the following purposes: 

. expansion of our sales and marketing efforts, including increased advertising 
on other Web sites and print media and direct advertising campaigns 
(approximately $3.6 million); 

. repayment of indebtedness (approximately $3.0 million); 

. equipment purchases including certain additional back-up systems 
(approximately $2.5 million); 

. software development (approximately $850,000); 

. increasing deposits with credit card processing companies (approximately 
$150,000); and 

. general corporate purposes, including working capital for payment of 
outstanding payables, development of relationships with other long distance 
carriers and local terminating parties, expansion of the countries in which we 
have gateways, and research and development of new products (approximately 
$21.5 million). 

Part of the indebtedness to be repaid is a portion of a $2.5 million credit 
facility with Eagle Venture Capital, LLC, formerly known as WorldQuest 
Networks, LLC, our controlling stockholder. B. Michael Adler, our Chairman of 
the Board, owns a controlling interest in Eagle Venture. At September 30, 1999, 
$1.9 million was outstanding under the credit facility. The facility consists 
of a $1.1 million term loan and a revolving line of credit of up to $1.4
 million. The facility bears interest at 8% per year and the $1.1 million term 
loan and accrued interest thereon is payable May 5, 2002. Any balance 
outstanding under the $1.4 million revolving line of credit is payable on May 
5, 2002, unless demand is made by Eagle Venture for earlier payment, and 
accrued interest on the line of credit portion is payable on February 18, 2000 
and thereafter is payable monthly. Demand for payment of $780,000 of the 
principal balance of the line of credit portion (with accrued interest thereon) 
has been made effective upon closing of this offering. The proceeds of this 
credit facility were used to provide us with working capital. 

The remainder of the indebtedness to be repaid is $1.9 million of principal 
owed under 33 promissory notes payable to 33 persons and entities. These notes 
bear interest at 8% per year and are payable on the earlier of the closing of 
this offering or December 31, 2000. These notes were sold by us in a private 
placement of units consisting of notes and common stock purchase warrants that
 closed in December 1999. The proceeds from these notes were used to provide us 
with working capital. The fair value of the stock purchase warrants of $1.5 
million will be recognized as additional interest expense over the term of the 
promissory notes. 

Prior to their eventual use, the net proceeds will be invested in high quality, 
short-term investment instruments such as short-term corporate investment grade 
or United States Government interest-bearing securities."

be approximately $191.0 million. We intend to use substantially all of the net 
proceeds to redeem or repurchase our outstanding senior notes and to pay the 
redemption premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon. We will use any 
remaining net proceeds, if any, for general corporate purposes, including 
working capital. 

Our senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $115.0 million mature on 
May 15, 2004, and bear interest at the rate of 10 5/8% per annum. Under the
 terms of the indenture relating to the senior notes, we are required to use 
the net proceeds from this offering to make an offer to redeem up to 35% of the 
aggregate principal amount of the senior notes outstanding at a price equal to 
110.625% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon. Following the completion of the offering, we intend to seek to 
repurchase the remaining 65% of the senior notes not otherwise redeemed through 
a tender offer or open market purchases. The price at which we will offer to 
repurchase such senior notes will be based on market conditions. Pending such 
uses, we will invest such proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment- 
grade securities. See ""Description of Indebtedness--Senior Notes."" 

In the event that we are unable to repurchase the remainder of our outstanding 
senior notes in the manner described above, we believe it both prudent and 
feasible to defease the senior notes in accordance with the terms of the 
indenture governing such senior notes. Defeasance allows us to be discharged 
from some of our obligations with respect to the outstanding senior notes, such 
as covenants for the benefit of the holders of the senior notes. In order to 
exercise our defeasance option, we must, among other things, deposit for the 
benefit of the holders of our senior notes cash, non-callable U.S. government 
obligations or a combination of the foregoing, in an amount sufficient to repay 
the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding senior notes."

together with remaining cash proceeds available under the Nortel loan financing 
at January 1, 2000 of $152.5 million, to fund the following cash expenditures 
through 2002:

approximately $45 million; and 

- general corporate purposes. 

We will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this 
offering. This discussion represents our best estimate of the allocation of the 
net proceeds of this offering based upon our current plans. Actual expenditures 
may vary substantially from these estimates and we may find it necessary or 
advisable to reallocate the net proceeds within the above-described categories 
or to use portions for other purposes. The timing and the coverage of our build-
out plan may change due to various reasons, including shifts in populations or 
network focus, changes or advances in technology, acquisition of other markets, 
businesses, products or technologies and factors causing a delay in the build-
out of some markets. Any changes in the timing or build-out plan may cause 
changes in our use of proceeds. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that are 
complementary to our business. We currently do not have any commitments or 
agreements for any acquisitions or investments of this kind. 

Pending these uses, we expect to invest the net proceeds from the sale of the 
common stock in short-term investment grade securities, which will earn 
interest. 

We anticipate that the proceeds from our proposed offering of senior discount 
notes will not be needed to fund the required capital expenditures, working 
capital requirements, operating losses and other cash needs of our current 
business plan. However, we cannot assure you that our notes offering will be 
completed."

hiring of additional field personnel and the development and implementation of 
strategies to expand into the private security market and international markets

regional trade shows. We also plan to update our collateral sales material and 
place targeted advertising in relevant trade publications.

Between April and May 1999 we received bridge loans in the aggregate amount of 
$150,000 from third party accredited investors. These loans are evidenced by 
promissory notes bearing interest at 8% per year with maturity dates ranging 
from March 31, 2000 through January 1, 2001. 

Our anticipated use of net proceeds are based upon our current status of 
operations and anticipated business plans. It is possible that the application 
of funds may vary depending on numerous factors including, but not limited to, 
changes in the economic climate or unanticipated complications, delay and 
expenses. We currently estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will 
be sufficient to meet our liquidity and working capital requirements for the 
next 12 months. However, there can be no assurance that the net proceeds of 
this offering will satisfy our requirements for any particular period of time. 
Additional financing may be required to implement our long-term business plan. 
There can be no assurance that any such additional financing will be available 
when needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Pending use of the proceeds 
of this offering, we may make temporary investments in bank certificates of 
deposit, interest bearing savings accounts, prime commercial paper, U.S. 
Government obligations and money market funds. Any income derived from these 
short term investments will be used for working capital. 

We have wide discretion in the use of our proceeds. We reserve the right to use 
the funds obtained from this offering for other purposes not presently 
contemplated which we deem to be in our best interest and the best interest of 
our shareholders. As a result, our success will be substantially dependent upon 
the discretion and judgment of our management. The applicationand allocation of 
the net proceeds of the offering are determined by discretion and judgment of 
our management."

establishment of new business opportunities that are complementary to our 
current and future business. Although we have not identified any specific

current agreements or understandings with respect to any such transactions, we 
may from time to time evaluate such opportunities. The amounts actually used

 that we will use approximately $50 million of the net proceeds from this

Accordingly, management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the 
net proceeds of this offering. You will not have the opportunity to evaluate

fund the $210.0 million purchase price of the wire harness business and to 
repay approximately $629.4 million in borrowings outstanding under our senior 
credit facilities, with the remainder to be used for general corporate 
purposes. 

On December 31, 1999, the weighted average annual interest rate applicable to 
our existing senior credit facility was approximately 8.5%. The outstanding 
indebtedness under our existing senior credit facility was used in part to fund 
the acquisition of the printed circuit board manufacturing business of Termbray 
Industries International (Holdings) Limited in August 1999, to repay amounts 
outstanding under our revolving loan facility and to cash collateralize future 
amounts due under our term loans. Approximately $187.3 million of the term 
loans under our existing senior credit facility relate to our acquisition of 
Interconnections Systems Limited. The operations formerly conducted by 
Interconnections Systems Limited are being transferred prior to this offering 
to our existing stockholders. Our senior credit facility is also used on an 
ongoing basis for debt service requirements, working capital needs and capital 
expenditures and may be used in the future to fund acquisitions of other 
businesses. Our existing senior credit facility is scheduled to expire on June 
30, 2005. Concurrently with the offering, we expect to refinance the remaining 
amounts outstanding under our existing senior credit facility with a new senior 
credit facility. 

The wire harness business is being acquired from International Wire, a 
designer, manufacturer and marketer of wire products and wire harnesses 
controlled by affiliates of Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Incorporated, for $210.0 
million in cash. The purchase price was determined by senior management of 
Viasystems and International Wire. In addition, each of the boards of directors 
of Viasystems and International Wire are expected to receive opinions from 
nationally recognized financial advisors that the purchase price is fair, from 
a financial point of view, to each of the respective parties. The acquisition 
of the wire harness business will be accounted for at historical cost, on a 
basis similar to a pooling of interests, as Viasystems Group, Inc. and 
International Wire are under common control. 

The acquisition price for the network components and services business of 
Marconi Communications, Inc. will be funded by amounts available under our new 
senior credit facility. While this acquisition is expected to close on March 
30, 2000, we cannot assure you that the closing will occur at, or subsequent 
to, that time. This offering is not dependent on the closing of the 
acquisition."

Except to the extent that any portion of the net proceeds is used to repay a 
working capital bridge loan from Phoenix under the Contribution Agreement 
(which amount is not expected to exceed $2 million), no portion of the net 
proceeds of this offering has been earmarked for any specific purpose. We 
expect that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $37.7 
million, based on an initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, after 
paying underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. We expect to 
use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, 
sales and marketing, and research and development. In addition, we may use a 
portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies or 
companies. From time to time, we may acquire complementary products, 
technologies or companies. We currently have no commitments or agreements and 
are not involved in any negotiations for the acquisition of companies. Our 
management will have broad discretion in the allocation of net proceeds. 
Pending use, the net proceeds will be invested in short-term securities. We are 
not under any contractual or other obligation, nor do we expect, to pay any 
dividends or distribute any of the net proceeds from this offering to Phoenix 
other than for the provision of administrative services included in the 
Services and Cost-Sharing Agreement."

servers, workstations, networking equipment and telecommunications equipment. 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest-
bearing investments. We will use a portion of the proceeds from this offering 
to retire $1,000,000 of the $1,500,000 of subordinated debt owed by us to 
Research Partners, all of which was provided to us by Research Partners to 
satisfy our net capital requirements. The note being repaid was issued when 
Research Partners purchased Shochet Securities; it bears an annual interest 
rate of 12% and must be repaid by May 31, 2000. The remaining $500,000 was 
issued in August 1999; it bears an annual interest rate of 8% and must be 
repaid by August 31, 2001. Based upon our current business plan, we believe 
that the funds generated by this offering will be sufficient to fund our 
capital requirements for at least 24 months from the date of this prospectus. 
Any funds realized from the underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment 
option will be used for working capital."

from: 

- the sale by us of 3,800,000 ordinary shares in this offering, after 
deducting the underwriting discount and the estimated offering expenses; 
and 

- the sale by us of 590,822 ordinary shares to Siemens and Samsung in the 
concurrent private placement at $17.00 per ordinary share. 

We expect to use the net proceeds to finance the continued growth of our 
business and for general corporate purposes. Our principal purposes for 
conducting this offering are to: 

- provide working capital for general corporate purposes; 

- fund possible acquisitions of additional businesses and technologies or 
investments in public or private companies in related businesses or the 
establishment of joint ventures that are complementary to our current or future 
business; and 

- provide a public market for our ordinary shares, which would facilitate our 
issuing equity securities as consideration for acquisitions and incentive 
compensation to employees. 

We have no plans or commitments for any specific acquisition, investment or 
joint venture and we cannot be sure that we will complete any acquisition, 
investment or joint venture. 

Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, or 
bank deposits with interest and principal linked to the U.S. dollar or the 
Israel consumer price index, or deposit the net proceeds in U.S. dollar bank 
accounts in Israel or outside of Israel."

this offering will be approximately $77.8 million, at an initial offering price 
of $17.00 per share and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts

We anticipate that we will use substantially all of the net proceeds for 
general corporate purposes, including: 

- working capital, in the estimated amount of approximately $38.3 million; 

- hiring personnel, in the estimated amount of approximately $9.0 million; 

- capital expenditures, in the estimated amount of approximately $7.5 million; 

- expansion of sales and marketing activities, in the estimated amount of 
approximately $20.0 million; and 

- development of technology, in the estimated amount of approximately $3.0 
million. 

Due to the rapidly changing nature of the market in which we operate, the 
amounts we actually spend for general corporate purposes will depend on a 
number of factors, including revenue growth, if any, and the amount of cash we 
generate from operations. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the 
allocation and use of the net proceeds of this offering. Until allocated for

stock in this offering will be approximately $135.4 million, at an initial 
public offering price of $24.00 per share and after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses. We 
estimate that our net proceeds will be used as follows: 

. approximately $69.0 million will be used to repay outstanding debt under the 
term loan portion of our credit facility; 

. approximately $15.5 million will be used to repay outstanding borrowings 
under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility; 

. approximately $1.9 million will be used to repay accrued and unpaid interest 
on the term loan and revolving credit; and 

. approximately $4.5 million will be used to repay two outstanding notes issued 
in connection with the repurchase of options and warrants. 

The remaining $44.5 million will be used to support the working capital 
requirements and capital expenditures associated with our anticipated growth, 
including expenditures related to infrastructure improvements and the opening 
of new offices in the U.S. or abroad. 

We may invest a portion of the net proceeds that are not used to retire debt to 
finance selective acquisitions of complementary businesses, make strategic 
investments in new businesses, or accelerate our office expansion plans, in 
each case as economically justified opportunities are presented. We intend to 
consider both acquisitions and internal development as alternatives for 
expanding our current capabilities and geographic presence. Although we 
regularly review strategic acquisition opportunities, we have no binding 
agreements with respect to any material acquisitions at this time. 

As of December 31, 1999, there was approximately $68.5 million outstanding 
under the term loan portion of our credit facility, which bore interest on that 
date of 8.475%. The term loan portion of the credit facility is repayable in 
quarterly installments which commenced on September 30, 1999 with final 
maturity on December 31, 2004. We received the proceeds of the term loan 
portion of the credit facility in January 1999 and used them in connection with 
the recapitalization primarily to repay indebtedness, satisfy contractual 
obligations to former shareholders, make transaction payments to existing 
equity holders, repurchase stock options and stock appreciation rights and pay 
expenses. As of December 31, 1999, there was nothing outstanding under the 
revolving credit portion of our credit facility, which bore interest on that 
date of 9.8%. The revolving credit portion of the credit facility is repayable 
on December 31, 2004. The revolving credit facility was originated in January 
1999 and is used to finance seasonal working capital requirements. 

Until allocated for specific use, we will invest our net proceeds in government 
securities and other short-term, investment-grade securities. Digitas will not 
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common stock in this offering by 
the selling shareholders."

distribution to cover their aggregate federal and state income tax liabilities

(1) Based upon the exchange rate for U.S. dollars per one euro as of March 3, 
2000, the total dollar amount of the notes would be approximately $192.4 
million. 
(2) Based on the initial public offering price of $14.90 per ordinary share and 
13.0 million shares that are being sold in this offering. IFCO Systems has 
granted the underwriters in this offering an overallotment option to purchase 
up to 1.95 million additional shares. Assumes that the overallotment option has

by PalEx to sellers in connection with acquisitions, which bear interest at 
rates ranging from 6.0% to 8.0% and have maturity dates from March 18, 2000, to 
July 14, 2000. Since October 24, 1999, approximately $1.6 million outstanding 
under these notes has been paid. On November 10, 1999, PalEx issued $25.0

The principal purposes of this offering are: 
. to increase our equity capital; 
. to create a public market for our common stock; 
. to facilitate future access by us to public equity markets; 
. to provide increased visibility and credibility in a marketplace in light of 
the fact that several of our current and potential competitors are, or may in

exercise of options under our 1998 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. We have an 
option to acquire such shares for that purpose at an exercise price of $3.42 per

 put these shares to us at the same price. The series B preferred stock, along
 with our other outstanding series of preferred stock, will convert into common
 stock automatically upon the completion of this offering. We expect to use the
 remaining net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes and capital expenditures, expansion of our business, product
 development and potential acquisitions. We have not identified specific uses 
for such proceeds and management will have discretion over their use and 
investment. Pending such uses, we will invest the net proceeds from this offering
 in investment grade, interest-bearing securities. 
We intend to seek acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies that are
 complementary to ours, and a portion of the net proceeds may be used for such
 acquisitions. While we discuss potential acquisitions from time to time, we

Connecticut Bancshares will purchase all of the capital stock of Savings Bank 
of Manchester to be issued in the conversion in exchange for 50% of the net 
proceeds of the stock offering. Receipt of the 50% of the net proceeds of the 
sale of the common stock will increase Savings Bank of Manchester's capital and 
will support the expansion of Savings Bank of Manchester's existing business 
activities. Savings Bank of Manchester will use the funds contributed to it for 
general business purposes, including, loan originations and investment in short-
 to intermediate-term investment grade securities as well as government issued 
mortgage-backed securities. 

Connecticut Bancshares intends to loan to the employee stock ownership plan the 
amount necessary for the plan to acquire an amount of shares equal to 8% of the 
shares issued in the conversion, including shares issued to SBM Foundation. 
Accordingly, acquisitions by the employee stock ownership plan would range 
between 844,560 shares at the minimum of the offering range and 1,142,640 
shares at the maximum of the offering range. At the midpoint of the offering 
range, the employee stock ownership plan would acquire 993,600, shares. If 
16,425,450 shares are issued in the conversion, the employee stock ownership 
plan would acquire 1,314,036 shares. The employee stock ownership plan plans to 
acquire such amount of stock by subscribing for 5% of the shares sold in the 
conversion in the stock offering and acquiring the remaining balance of shares 
through open market purchases after the completion of the conversion. For 
purposes of the above table, it is assumed that any shares of common stock to 
be purchased by the employee stock ownership plan in the open market will be 
purchased at $10.00 per share. If there are not enough shares to satisfy the 
employee stock ownership plan's subscription for shares sold in the conversion, 
the plan may purchase such shares in the open market after conversion. It is 
anticipated that the employee stock ownership plan loan will have a 15-year 
term with a fixed rate of interest equal to the prime rate published in The 
Wall Street Journal on the closing date of the conversion. The loan will be 
repaid primarily from Savings Bank of Manchester's contributions to the 
employee stock ownership plan and from any dividends paid on shares of common 
stock held by the employee stock ownership plan. 
The remaining net proceeds retained by Connecticut Bancshares will initially be 
invested primarily in short- to intermediate-term investment grade securities. 
Connecticut Bancshares may also use the funds it retains to support future 
expansion of operations or diversification into other banking or financial 
services related businesses and for other business or investment purposes. 
However, there are no specific plans, arrangements, agreements or 
understandings, written or oral, regarding any expansion activities. 

Connecticut Bancshares may also use available funds to repurchase shares of 
common stock and for the payment of dividends, subject to any limitations set 
forth in applicable laws and regulations. Following the conversion, the Board 
of Directors will have the authority to adopt plans that meet statutory and 
regulatory requirements for repurchases of common stock. Since Connecticut 
Bancshares has not yet issued stock, there currently is insufficient 
information upon which an intention to repurchase stock could be based and 
consequently, no such intention currently exists. The Board of Directors will 
consider many facts and circumstances in determining whether to repurchase 
stock in the future. These factors include market and economic factors such as 
the price at which the stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, 
the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of 
return and risk involved in the investment, the ability to increase the book 
value and/or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the 
ability to improve Connecticut Bancshares' return on equity. The avoidance of 
dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional shares to cover the 
exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit plans is another 
factor that will be considered. The Board of Directors will also consider any 
other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of 
Connecticut Bancshares and its stockholders. 

Before undertaking any stock repurchases, the Board of Directors must determine 
that both Connecticut Bancshares and Savings Bank of Manchester will be 
capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any 
repurchases and that capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other 
things, Savings Bank of Manchester's level of nonperforming and classified 
assets, Connecticut Bancshares' and Savings Bank of Manchester's current and 
projected results of operations and asset/liability structure, the economic 
environment and tax and other regulatory considerations. For a discussion of 
the regulatory limitations applicable to stock repurchases, see ""The Conversion-
 -Restrictions on Repurchase of Stock."" 

Except as described above, neither Connecticut Bancshares nor Savings Bank of 
Manchester has specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this 
offering. For a discussion of management's business reasons for undertaking the 
conversion, see ""The Conversion--Reasons for the Conversion."""

underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, at an initial public 
offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for additional 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including increased 
research and development expenditures, sales and marketing expenditures, and 
general and administrative expenditures. We also intend to use $10.0 million of 
the proceeds from this offering to repay our outstanding long-term note. This 
note bears interest at a rate of prime plus 2% and is due on February 1, 2001. 
Through December 31, 1999, we had paid approximately $175,000 in total interest 
on this note, at an average interest rate of 10.5% per annum. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire additional businesses, 
products and technologies, to lease additional facilities, or to establish 
joint ventures that we believe will complement our current or future business. 
However, we have no specific plans, agreements or commitments to do so and are 
not currently engaged in any negotiations for any acquisition or joint venture. 

The amounts that we actually expend for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, 
including future revenues growth, if any, and the amount of cash we generate 
from operations. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation 
of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, we will 
invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term interest bearing, 
investment-grade securities."

option in full, we will receive net proceeds of approximately $84,310,000. We 
currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

- approximately $30.0 million to fund the production of abarelix drug product; 

- approximately $30.0 million towards the purchase of our new facility and 
related improvements; 

- an undetermined amount for clinical trial expenses related to abarelix and 
other preclinical testing and expansion of research and development activities; 

- an undetermined amount for sales and marketing expenses associated with the 
commercial launch of abarelix; and 

- for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

In addition, we also may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for 
the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies. While we 
evaluate these types of opportunities from time to time, there are currently no 
agreements or negotiations with respect to any specific transaction. 

We have not yet determined all of our expected expenditures, and we cannot 
estimate the amounts to be used for each purpose set forth above. Accordingly, 
our management will have significant flexibility in applying a significant 
portion of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds 
as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in

working capital to fund anticipated operating losses. We expect to use 
approximately $2.8 million of the net proceeds in 2000 for capital expenditures 
primarily associated with expanding our manufacturing facilities and acquiring 
additional testing equipment. In addition, we plan to use approximately $22.6 
million of the net proceeds in 2000 to fund research and development 
activities. We may, when and if the opportunity arises, use a portion of the

the initial public offering price of $11.00 per share and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

- $16.0 million to fully repay the outstanding balance of our bank credit 
facility; and 

- $8.1 million for working capital and other general corporate purposes, 
including new product development and marketing expansion. We also may use a

blended variable interest rate per annum of LIBOR plus 300 basis points or 
prime plus 75 basis points. The term loan has a fixed interest rate of 10.67% 
per annum. The equipment financing arrangement has, at our option three days 
prior to the time used, a fixed interest rate per annum based on five-year U.S. 
Treasury notes plus 425 basis points or a variable interest rate per annum

credit facility matures on June 19, 2001."

- to repay the outstanding balance of $37.3 million on the term loan and the 
outstanding balance of $32.9 million on the U.S. dollar denominated portion of 
the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility; 

- to increase spending associated with research and development, new product 
development, enhancement of existing products and strategic collaborations and 
acquisitions; 

- to make open-market purchases from time to time of our 9 3/8% senior 
subordinated notes due March 4, 2007, $150 million of which in aggregate 
principal amount was outstanding as of February 29, 2000, in amounts, if any,

the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was $60.0 million, of 
which $32.9 million was denominated in U.S. dollars, maturing on March 31,

on the term loan was 9.2%, and on the revolving credit facility was 8.3%. We 
entered into our senior credit facility in connection with the recapitalization

expenses payable by us. We expect our aggregate net proceeds from the 
concurrent debt offerings to be $748 million. The closings of the Subordinate 
Voting Shares offering and the debt offerings are not contingent on each other. 

We expect to use the net proceeds from the offerings and funds from operations 
primarily: 

- to further develop and light our network; 

- to develop new facilities to enable us to provide value added network 
services such as colocation facilities and other communications services and 
products; 

- for future investments, acquisitions or strategic alliances in businesses or 
assets that are related or complementary to our existing business. However, we 
cannot assure you that we will successfully complete nor are we presently 
committed to make any such investments, acquisitions or strategic alliances; 
and 

- to fund operating losses, for working capital and for general corporate 
purposes. 

Following the consummation of our acquisition of GlobeNet, that company will 
have an obligation to offer to purchase any and all of its $300 million 
outstanding principal amount of senior notes. To the extent holders of the 
senior notes accept that offer, some of the net proceeds may be used to 
purchase those senior notes. 

We currently intend to allocate substantial proceeds to each of the foregoing 
uses. However, the precise allocation of funds among these uses will depend on 
future commercial, technological, regulatory and other developments which may 
affect our business, the competitive climate in which we operate and the 
emergence of future opportunities. Because of the number and variability of 
factors that determine our use of the net proceeds of this offering, we cannot 
assure you that our application of the net proceeds will not vary substantially 
from our current intentions. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds of this offering in short-term U.S. investment grade and government 
securities. 

The closing of this offering is not conditioned on the closing of either of the 
debt offerings. If we do not issue that debt because of market conditions or 
because terms acceptable to us are not available, we will need to raise 
additional capital to complete our network and other items described in this 
section. See ""Risk Factors--Additional Borrowings Required."" 

Our 360ATLANTIC project, which has an estimated total cost of $865 million, 
will be paid for with borrowings under our $565 million credit facility and 
$300 million raised from private equity investors in September 1999. The 
360ATLANTIC credit facility has been provided to a group of our subsidiaries 
and is non-recourse to us. 

We anticipate that GlobeNet's 360AMERICAS project, which has an estimated 
total cost of approximately $900 million, will be paid for with borrowings 
under GlobeNet's $400 million credit facility, the proceeds of GlobeNet's $300 
million issuance of senior notes in July 1999 and GlobeNet's cash on hand.

We do not have specific uses planned for the net proceeds of this offering. We

amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of 
factors, including competitive and technological developments, success of our 
marketing efforts and the rate of growth of our business. Because of these 
uncertainties, we cannot tell you with any reasonable certainty how we plan to 
allocate the net proceeds. 

We will retain broad discretion in the allocation of net proceeds of this 
offering. 

A portion of the net proceeds may be used to acquire or make investments in 
complementary businesses, technologies, product lines or products. We have no 
current plans, agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisitions 
or investments. We are considering using a portion of the proceeds of this 
offering to exercise our options to acquire the remaining capital stock of our 
affiliated distributor, Embarcadero Europe Ltd. The options will expire in 
October 2001. If we had exercised these options on March 31, 2000, the cost of 
the acquisition would have been approximately $3.0 million.

term, interest bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit or 
direct or guaranteed U.S. government obligations, such as Treasury bills."

         First Federal of Olathe Bancorp will purchase all of the capital stock
of First Federal Savings to be issued in the conversion in exchange for 50% of
the net proceeds of the stock offering. Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds will
increase First Federal Savings' capital and will support the expansion of First
Federal Savings' existing business activities. First Federal Savings will use
these funds for general business purposes, including, loan originations and
investment in U.S. government and federal agency securities.
         First Federal of Olathe Bancorp intends to loan the employee stock
ownership plan the amount necessary to acquire an amount of shares equal to 8%
of the shares issued in the conversion. The loan to the ESOP will be $442,000
and $598,000 at the minimum and maximum of the offering range. The ESOP will
distribute the shares it purchases to our employees as the loan is repaid over
an estimated 20 years. See ""Management--Stock Benefit Plans--Employee Stock
Ownership Plan.""
         The net proceeds we use to purchase the capital stock of First Federal
Savings will be used by First Federal Savings for general corporate purposes,
including increased lending activities. On a short-term basis, First Federal
Savings may purchase investment and mortgage-backed securities. The net proceeds
received by First Federal Savings will further strengthen First Federal Savings'
capital position, which already exceeds all regulatory requirements. After the
conversion, First Federal Savings' tangible capital ratio will be 21.97%, based
upon the midpoint of the offering range. As a result, First Federal Savings will
continue to be a well-capitalized institution.
         We may initially use the remaining net proceeds retained by us to
invest in U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various maturities,
deposits in either the FHLB of Topeka or other financial institutions,
mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and
government-sponsored enterprises, or a combination of these items. The net
proceeds retained by us may ultimately be used to:
          o    support First Federal Savings' lending activities
          o    support the future expansion of operations through establishment
               of branch offices or other customer facilities, expansion into
               other lending markets or diversification into other banking
               related businesses, although no such transactions are
               specifically being considered at this time
          o    pay regular or special cash dividends, repurchase the common
               stock or pay returns of capital
         Applicable conversion regulations require us to sell common stock in
the conversion in an amount equal to our estimated pro forma market value, as
determined by an independent appraisal. See ""The Conversion - Stock Pricing and
Number of Shares to be Issued."" As a result, we may be required to sell more
shares in the conversion than we may otherwise desire. To the extent we have
excess capital upon completion of the conversion, we intend to consider stock
repurchases, dividends and tax-free returns of capital to the extent permitted
by the Office of Thrift Supervision and deemed appropriate by the board of
directors. A return of capital is similar to a cash dividend, except for tax
purposes it is an adjustment to your tax basis rather than income to you. We
have committed to the OTS that we will not take any action toward paying a
tax-free return of capital during the first year after we complete the
conversion.
         Stock repurchases will be considered by our Board of Directors after we
complete the conversion based upon then existing facts and circumstances, as
well as applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Such facts and
circumstances may include but not be limited to the following:
          o    market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock
               is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the
               attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the
               rate of return and risk involved in the investment, the ability
               to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the
               remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in our return on
               equity
          o    the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue
               additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to
               fund employee stock benefit plans
          o    any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best
               interests of First Federal of Olathe Bancorp and our stockholders
         No stock will be repurchased by us unless First Federal Savings
continues to exceed all applicable regulatory requirements after the
repurchases. The payment of dividends or repurchase of stock will be prohibited
if First Federal Savings' net worth would be reduced below the amount required
for the liquidation account to be established for the benefit of eligible
account holders and supplemental eligible account holders. As of the date of
this prospectus, the initial balance of the liquidation account would be
approximately $9.0 million. See ""Dividend Policy,"" ""The Conversion--Effects of
Conversion to Stock Form on Depositors and Borrowers of First Federal
Savings--Liquidation Rights"" and ""--Restrictions on Transferability.""
         Our net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion may
be more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the
number of shares to be issued in the conversion is adjusted to reflect a change
in the estimated pro forma market value of First Federal Savings. Payments for
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at First Federal
Savings will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by First
Federal Savings but will result in a reduction of First Federal Savings'
interest expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing
certificates or other deposit accounts."

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of 2,625,000 shares of our 
common stock in the private placement that will occur concurrently with the 
closing of this offering will be approximately $20.4 million, based on a per

agent compensation payable by us. 

At this time, the principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional 
capital to increase our financial flexibility and to create a public market for 
our common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and the 
private placement that will occur concurrently with this offering as follows: 

- an estimated $8 million to $10 million for research and development; 

- an estimated $5 million to $8 million for capital expenditures; 

- an estimated $15 million to $25 million in connection with sales, marketing 
and administrative expenses, which will include the expansion of our sales and 
marketing organization; and 

- the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

 in the offering, which in turn will depend on RP Financial's appraisal,
 regulatory and market considerations, and the expenses incurred in connection 
with the offering. Although we will not be able to determine the actual net
 proceeds from the sale of the common stock until we complete the offering, we 
estimate the net proceeds to be between $65.7 million and $89.7 million $103.5

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the conversion may
 be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if
 a syndicated community offering is used to sell shares not purchased in the
 subscription offering and community offering. The net proceeds will also vary
 if the number of shares to be sold in the offering are adjusted to reflect a 
change in the estimated pro forma market value of Port Financial Corp. and
 Cambridgeport Bank or if our ESOP purchases shares in the open market at an 
average cost that is higher or lower than $10 per share. Payments for shares
 made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result in the
 receipt of new funds for investment by Cambridgeport Bank but will result in a
reduction of Cambridgeport Bank's deposits and interest expense as funds are 
transferred from interest bearing certificates of deposit or other deposit 
accounts. 

Port Financial Corp. may use the proceeds it retains from the offering: 

. to finance possible acquisitions of financial institutions or other businesses related to banking; 
. to pay dividends to stockholders; 
. to repurchase shares of common stock issued in the conversion; 
. to invest in securities; and 
. for general corporate purposes. 
Cambridgeport Bank may use the proceeds it receives from the offering: 
. to fund new loans; 
. to establish or acquire new branches; 
. to diversify products that we offer; 
. to increase delivery systems, including the introduction of internet banking; 
. to invest in securities; and 
. for general corporate purposes. 
Our ability to repurchase our common stock may be subject to regulatory 
restrictions. See ""Management-Future Stock Benefit Plans."""

stock in this offering will be approximately $153.8 million. We intend to use: 

. approximately $24.7 million of the net proceeds to redeem a portion of the 
senior discount notes issued by our subsidiary, DDi Intermediate Holdings 
Corp., or to redeem a portion of the senior discount notes issued by our 
subsidiary, DDi Capital Corp., and to pay associated redemption premiums and 
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and/or to repurchase some of the DDi 
capital senior discount notes on the open market; 

. approximately $100.0 million of the net proceeds to reduce the indebtedness 
of our subsidiary, Dynamic Details, Incorporated, under its senior credit 
facility; 

. approximately $23.9 million of the net proceeds to repay the MCM Electronics 
investor loans, including accrued interest assumed in connection with our 
acquisition of MCM Electronics. See ""Prospectus Summary--Recent Developments;"" 
and 

. approximately $5.2 million of the net proceeds to pay cash consideration, 
including fees and expenses, in connection with our acquisition of MCM 
Electronics. 

The amounts stated above are based on expected outstanding accreted values of 
these obligations as of April 14, 2000 for the DDi Intermediate senior discount 
notes, the Dynamic Details senior credit facility and the MCM Electronics 
investor loans and as of May 14, 2000 for the DDi Capital senior discount 
notes. The distribution of the net proceeds from this offering will change to 
reflect increases in accreted values of these obligations depending on the date 
on which this offering closes. 

We own 100% of the capital stock of DDi Intermediate Holdings Corp., which in 
turn owns 100% of the capital stock of DDi Capital Corp., which in turn owns 
100% of the capital stock of Dynamic Details, Incorporated, our primary 
operating subsidiary. 

Our DDi Intermediate senior discount notes mature on June 30, 2008, and bear 
interest at the rate of 13.5% per annum. As of December 31, 1999, the 
outstanding accreted value of these senior discount notes was approximately 
$40.8 million. Under the terms of the indenture relating to the senior discount 
notes, we may use the net proceeds from this offering to redeem all of the DDi 
Intermediate senior discount notes outstanding at a price that would provide 
the noteholders with a 20% per annum return on the price at which the notes 
were issued, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Approximately 50% of the 
DDi Intermediate senior discount notes are held by investment funds advised by 
Sankaty Advisors, Inc., an affiliate of Bain Capital. See ""Related Party 
Transactions."" 

Our DDi Capital senior discount notes mature on November 15, 2007, and bear 
interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum. As of December 31, 1999, the accreted 
value on these senior discount notes was approximately $77.7 million. Under the 
terms of the indenture relating to the senior discount notes, we may use the 
net proceeds from this offering to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal 
amount of the senior discount notes outstanding at a price equal to 112.5% of 
the accreted value thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. See 
""Description of Indebtedness--DDi Capital Senior Discount Notes."" 

The Dynamic Details senior credit facility consists of multi-tranche term loans 
and a revolving credit facility with a final maturity date in April 2005 and an 
aggregate principal balance of $251.7 million as of December 31, 1999. The 
loans under this facility bear interest at varying rates based, at our option, 
on either LIBOR plus 225 to 250 basis points or the bank rate plus 125 to 150 
basis points. The overall effective interest rate for the term loans at 
December 31, 1999 was 8.90%. See ""Description of Indebtedness--Dynamic Details 
Senior Credit Facility."" 

The MCM Electronics investor loans mature on June 30, 2001. During the year 
ending June 30, 2000, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at 6.5% per 
annum. The loans must be repaid upon a change of control of MCM Electronics. 

Pending these uses, we will invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest- 
bearing, investment-grade securities."

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our working capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate our future access to 
public capital markets, to enhance our ability to acquire other businesses and 
to provide us with increased visibility and credibility in our market. We 
expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, and the $14.0 million of 
proceeds from the sale of our common stock to Dell USA in the concurrent 
placement described below, for working capital and general corporate purposes, 
including an estimated $5 to $7 million for capital expenditures, an estimated 
$15 to $20 million for sales and marketing and an estimated $15 to $20 million 
for product and technology development. We also intend to use $350,000 of the 
proceeds to repay in full our non-interest bearing promissory note issued in 
connection with the acquisition of INDUSTRYINSITE.COM. The note was issued on 
January 12, 2000. We have no specific plans for the remaining proceeds. We also 
intend to use the proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private 
placement to fund the repurchase of any shares and options tendered in 
connection with our rescission offer with respect to shares of, or options to 
purchase, our common stock issued to our FREEAGENT E.OFFICE employees. The 
amount required for the repurchase may be up to $0.9 million plus interest. See 
""Rescission Offer"" for more information regarding this offer. 

The actual amounts expended for the specific purposes set forth above may vary 
from our current expectations and we may reallocate the proceeds of this 
offering and the concurrent private placement among the categories discussed 
above or use a portion of the proceeds from the offering and the concurrent 
private placement for purposes not presently contemplated. As a result, we will 
have broad discretion as to how the net proceeds of this offering will be used. 
Our use of the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent placement may 
change to respond to conditions and factors affecting our business, 
particularly competitive and technological developments, the success of our 
products in the market and of our branding efforts, the growth, if any, of our 
business and our need to increase our capital expenditures to support any 
growth in our business. 

We may also use a portion of these proceeds for potential acquisitions of 
technologies, products or businesses which may be complementary to our 
business. We currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any 
future acquisitions or investments. Pending any use, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds from this offering in interest-bearing, investment-grade 
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the 
U.S. Government. 

Concurrent Private Placement 

On March 1, 2000, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Dell USA 
L.P., an affiliate of Dell Computer Corporation, under which Dell USA has 
agreed to purchase shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of 
$14.0 million. Dell USA will purchase the shares at a price equal to the 
initial public offering price per share less an amount equal to the per share 
underwriting discounts and commissions received by the underwriters, as set 
forth on the cover page of this prospectus, except that in no event will Dell 
USA's purchase price exceed $22.00 per share. Dell USA will purchase 1,505,376 
shares of our common stock in the concurrent placement at $9.30 per share. 
Since Dell USA will purchase the shares directly from us in a private 
placement, the underwriters will not receive any discount or commission on the 
sale of the shares. The closing of this concurrent placement is contingent on, 
and will close simultaneously with, the closing of this offering. 

The shares being sold in the concurrent placement will not be registered for 
immediate sale under the Securities Act and, subject to limited exceptions 
involving a sale of the company or a change of control, Dell USA has agreed not 
to sell its common stock for a one year period. We will also enter into a 
registration rights agreement with Dell USA under which it will have two demand 
registration rights and unlimited piggyback registration rights to have its 
shares of common stock registered for resale under the Securities Act. Dell USA 
may exercise its demand rights only if the anticipated gross offering price
 will be at least $3.0 million and only after we are qualified to use Form S-3, 
a short-form registration statement, to register our securities under the 
Securities Act, which will be at least one year after completion of this 
offering. See ""Shares Eligible for Future Sale--Registration Rights."" 
In connection with Dell USA's purchase of our common stock, Dell Marketing 
L.P., the marketing affiliate of Dell Computer, entered into a marketing 
agreement under which Dell Marketing will provide a prominent link to our 
website on its website. In addition, Dell Marketing will include us as a 
featured offer in one issue of its quarterly software and peripherals catalogue.
 The effectiveness of the marketing arrangement is conditional upon the sale of 
our shares of common stock to Dell USA in the concurrent placement. The term of 
the marketing arrangement will initially be for one year."

net proceeds will be approximately $66.2 million if the underwriters exercise 
their option to purchase an additional 450,000 shares from us to cover over-
allotments. 

We expect to use our net proceeds for the following purposes in the following 
approximate amounts: 
- Repayment of $30 million in borrowings under our loan agreement, which we 
anticipate will be outstanding when we consummate this offering 

- A distribution of $7 million to our existing shareholders as part of our pre-
offering corporate reorganization 

- $10 million for remodeling and relocation of selected older company-owned 
stores 

The remainder will be used for: 
- Additional mix production capacity to support expansion 

- Joint venture investments in area developer stores 

- General corporate purposes, including working capital needs 

Although we do not contemplate any changes in our use of proceeds, we may 
reprioritize the uses listed above, or use some proceeds for other purposes in 
the event extra proceeds are available or the specified uses require less 
capital than expected. 

Our loan agreement covers both a revolving line of credit and a term loan. At 
our option, the revolving line of credit bears interest at either our lender's 
prime rate minus 110 basis points or a rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis 
points. Alternatively, we can choose to convert all or a portion of our 
indebtedness under the revolving line of credit to a term loan for a period of 
60, 84 or 120 months with interest based on, at our option, either: 
- A variable prime rate method 

- A variable LIBOR method 

- A swap rate method with a prime rate-linked cap 

Interest on our term loan is computed on the same basis as the revolving line 
of credit, except that the rate has a floor of 5.500% and a ceiling of 8.125%. 
At January 30, 2000, our revolving line of credit and term loan both bore 
interest rates of 6.823%. 

As of January 30, 2000, $3.6 million was outstanding under the term loan and 
$19.3 million under the revolving line of credit. On January 31, 2000, we 
repurchased the New York City territory from an area developer for $6.9 million 
using funds available under our line of credit. Subject to some conditions, we 
have agreed to refranchise this territory to a new area developer, but will 
retain a minority interest. If we do not prepay it, indebtedness under our 
revolving credit facility matures in July 2002, and under our term loan, in 
June 2001. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we will invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade or government 
securities."

of common stock until we complete the reorganization and stock offering. We 
estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the sale of the common stock of 
between $3,864,000 at the minimum of the offering range and $5,423,000 at the 
maximum, of the offering range. See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Reorganization."" 
Assuming the sale of $5,194,000 of common stock at the midpoint of the offering 
range and the purchase of 8% of the shares by the employee stock ownership 
plan, the following table shows the manner in which we will use the net 
proceeds: 


Loan to employee stock ownership plan ............  $  415,000
Investment in stock of American Federal ..........   2,322,000
Working capital for Eagle Bancorp ................   1,906,520
                                                    ----------
Total ............................................  $4,644,000
                                                    ==========


 

Approximately 41% of the net proceeds of the offering have no specifically 
earmarked purpose and will be used initially as working capital. This working 
capital will be invested by us in U.S. government and federal agency 
securities, marketable securities, or a combination of both. Over time we 
anticipate the potential uses of the proceeds retained by Eagle to include 
possible acquisitions among the various financial institutions located in 
Montana, the payment of dividends to stockholders and the repurchase of our 
common stock. However, there are no current agreements or arrangements 
regarding acquisitions. These potential uses of proceeds may change, depending 
on market conditions after the reorganization. 

The funds received by American Federal Savings Bank from us in return for the 
purchase of all of American Federal's stock will be used for general corporate 
purposes, including lending and investing in securities. These funds will 
increase American Federal's total capital to expand investment and support 
lending and internal growth. 
The net proceeds will vary because total expenses of the reorganization may be 
more or less than those estimated. Payments for shares made through withdrawals 
from existing American Federal Savings Bank deposit accounts will not result in 
the receipt of new funds for investment by American Federal. Withdrawals will 
reduce American Federal's deposits and interest expense as funds are 
transferred from certificates or other deposit accounts. 

We believe that the reorganization and stock offering provide several important 
business benefits including allowing American Federal Savings Bank to become a 
stock institution, increasing capital without risking a loss of control and 
providing for an incremental increase in capital."

$14.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and

sales, marketing and reimbursement activities, future development of our 
product lines and approximately $9.0 million to repay debt with interest rates 
ranging from 7% to 13% and maturities ranging from month to month to August 
2002. We currently intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate 
purposes. The debt being repaid was used primarily for purchasing generators 
and funding the increased costs of operations as ORATEC's sales activities 
increased. We have not yet determined our expected use of the remaining 
proceeds, but we currently estimate that we will incur at least $18 million in 
sales, marketing, reimbursement and product development expenses and $5 million 
in capital expenditures over the next 18 months. We may use a portion of the 
net proceeds to fund, acquire or invest in complementary businesses or 
technologies, although we have no present commitments with respect to any 
acquisition or investment. The amount of cash that we actually expend for any 
of the described purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of 
factors, including future sales growth, if any, and the amount of cash we 
generate from operations. Thus, management will have significant discretion in 
applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above,

The foregoing represents management's current estimate of how the proceeds of 
this offering will be used and is subject to change based on changing 
circumstances and differing needs of R-Tec as they may exist in the future. 
R-Tec may reallocate the proceeds in the above described categories or to other 
purposes in response to changes in its plans, industry conditions, and R-Tec's 
future revenues and expenditures. 

We believe that the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered 
assuming that all shares offered are sold, will provide R-Tec sufficient capital
to fund initial operations, development and expansion of business for 
approximately the first 36 to 48 months following completion of this offering. 
If only the minimum is sold, R-Tec believes it will be able to operate for 12 
months if no revenue is generated from its operations. We had originally 
estimated that R-Tec could operate 24-36 months without revenues if $10,000,000 
of common stock were sold and 24 months if $5,000,000 of common stock were sold.
We have increased our estimates of the periods we can operate without revenue 
upon raising $10,000,000 to 36 to 48 months, and 24 to 36 months if we raise 
$5,000,000. This increase is based on our decision to develop fewer new products
and reduce the salaries of Mr. Scola, Mr. Lacqua and Mrs. Vitolo to $50,000 
each. In the event R-Tec had no revenues, the money raised could sustain R-Tec 
longer because fewer research and development projects would be undertaken 
initially, and as a result of the officers' salaries reduction, more funds were 
available to pay the salaries of other employees. 

Many factors may affect R-Tec's cash needs, including the possible failure to 
develop sufficient revenues from the sale of its products. R-Tec may not have 
sufficient capital for its funding requirements and may be unable to find 
suitable financing on acceptable terms. If R-Tec is unable to obtain such 
additional financing, our ability to maintain our level of operations could be 
materially adversely affected and R-Tec may not succeed. This event would 
significantly increase the risk of loss to those persons who invest in this 
offering. 

A portion of the proceeds will be used to pay a promissory note executed in 
payment for the patent which underlies our patented technology. $450,000 payable
in full thirty (30) days from the date R-Tec sells $2,000,000 of common stock; 
or if $2,000,000 of common shares is not sold before May 1, 2000, beginning May 
1, 2000, accrued interest payable quarterly for two (2) years until May 1, 2002,
at which time the R-Tec will make quarterly payments of $22,500 in principal and
accrued interest until paid in full. The note bears interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum. 

A portion of the proceeds will be used to repay a promissory note to an 
unrelated third party in the principal amount of $60,000 bearing interest at 
8.5% per annum. Under the terms of the note accrued interest is due monthly with
the entire principal amount is due at such time as R-Tec sells $2,000,000 of 
shares in this offering or November 15, 2000, which ever occurs first. 

Any portion of the net proceeds not required for immediate expenditure will be 
deposited in R-Tec's corporate checking account, interest-bearing accounts or 
invested in short-term government notes, treasury bills, or short-term 
obligations of financial institutions. 

We reserve the right to change the use of proceeds in the event that we 
determine based on our marketing efforts and research and testing of our 
products that an adjustment in the proceeds of this offering is warranted in 
the opinion of management. However, there will be no adjustment in any amounts
utilized to pay promissory note and patent expense."

The foregoing represents management's current estimate of how the proceeds of 
this offering will be used and is subject to change based on changing 
circumstances and differing needs of R-Tec as they may exist in the future. 
R-Tec may reallocate the proceeds in the above described categories or to other 
purposes in response to changes in its plans, industry conditions, and R-Tec's 
future revenues and expenditures. 

We believe that the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered 
assuming that all shares offered are sold, will provide R-Tec sufficient capital
to fund initial operations, development and expansion of business for 
approximately the first 36 to 48 months following completion of this offering. 
If only the minimum is sold, R-Tec believes it will be able to operate for 12 
months if no revenue is generated from its operations. We had originally 
estimated that R-Tec could operate 24-36 months without revenues if $10,000,000 
of common stock were sold and 24 months if $5,000,000 of common stock were sold.
We have increased our estimates of the periods we can operate without revenue 
upon raising $10,000,000 to 36 to 48 months, and 24 to 36 months if we raise 
$5,000,000. This increase is based on our decision to develop fewer new products
and reduce the salaries of Mr. Scola, Mr. Lacqua and Mrs. Vitolo to $50,000 
each. In the event R-Tec had no revenues, the money raised could sustain R-Tec 
longer because fewer research and development projects would be undertaken 
initially, and as a result of the officers' salaries reduction, more funds were 
available to pay the salaries of other employees. 

Many factors may affect R-Tec's cash needs, including the possible failure to 
develop sufficient revenues from the sale of its products. R-Tec may not have 
sufficient capital for its funding requirements and may be unable to find 
suitable financing on acceptable terms. If R-Tec is unable to obtain such 
additional financing, our ability to maintain our level of operations could be 
materially adversely affected and R-Tec may not succeed. This event would 
significantly increase the risk of loss to those persons who invest in this 
offering. 

A portion of the proceeds will be used to pay a promissory note executed in 
payment for the patent which underlies our patented technology. $450,000 payable
in full thirty (30) days from the date R-Tec sells $2,000,000 of common stock; 
or if $2,000,000 of common shares is not sold before May 1, 2000, beginning May 
1, 2000, accrued interest payable quarterly for two (2) years until May 1, 2002,
at which time the R-Tec will make quarterly payments of $22,500 in principal and
accrued interest until paid in full. The note bears interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum. 

A portion of the proceeds will be used to repay a promissory note to an 
unrelated third party in the principal amount of $60,000 bearing interest at 
8.5% per annum. Under the terms of the note accrued interest is due monthly with
the entire principal amount is due at such time as R-Tec sells $2,000,000 of 
shares in this offering or November 15, 2000, which ever occurs first. 

Any portion of the net proceeds not required for immediate expenditure will be 
deposited in R-Tec's corporate checking account, interest-bearing accounts or 
invested in short-term government notes, treasury bills, or short-term 
obligations of financial institutions. 

We reserve the right to change the use of proceeds in the event that we 
determine based on our marketing efforts and research and testing of our 
products that an adjustment in the proceeds of this offering is warranted in 
the opinion of management. However, there will be no adjustment in any amounts
utilized to pay promissory note and patent expense."

approximately $225.0 million. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, the net proceeds will be approximately $258.9 million. 
  
             The principal purposes of this offering are to establish a public 
market for our common stock, to increase our visibility in the marketplace, to 
facilitate future access to public capital markets, and to obtain additional 
working capital. 
  
             We presently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for 
general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures (approximately $30 
million), increasing our sales and marketing capabilities (approximately $30 
million), and working capital. Contingent upon the continued growth of our 
business and the availability of sufficient financing, we currently plan to 
spend approximately $700 million over the next five years, including in excess 
of a total of $100 million in 2000, on the expansion of our Global Data Storage 
Network, including the expansion and operation of existing S-POP data centers 
and the establishment and operation of additional S-POP data centers. We plan 
to finance our investment in this capital infrastructure, which we will use to 
operate more than 50 S-POP data centers by the end of 2000, primarily with 
current and future vendor financing, equipment lease lines and bank lines of 
credit, as well as other financing arrangements. We are currently working 
toward securing additional vendor financing and equipment lease lines and bank 
lines of credit in order to satisfy our 2000 expansion plans. These plans are 
subject to revision based on customer demand for our services, market 
conditions and other factors. Although we plan to finance these capital 
expenditures primarily through lease obligations and other financings, we may 
allocate additional proceeds from this offering to that expansion. We may also 
use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary 
businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary 
technologies. We have no specific understandings, commitments or agreements 
with respect to any such acquisition or investment. Pending these uses, the net 
proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade securities."

In connection with our ability to provide capital to our investment banking 
subsidiary, it may be difficult, if not impossible, for the subsidiary to 
repay this capital because of the restrictions imposed by the net capital 
requirements discussed under ""Business--Government Regulation."" 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest-
bearing investments. 

Our use of the net proceeds of this offering is based upon current plans and 
certain assumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions and our 
future revenue and expenditures. As these factors change, we may find it 
necessary or advisable to use portions for other purposes. As a result of these 
changes, we may be required to seek additional financing. We can give no 
assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable 
terms, or at all. Any failure to obtain additional financing, if required, 
could have an adverse effect on us, including possibly requiring us to curtail 
our operations."

million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses and reflecting the initial offering price of $25.00 per ADS. If the 
underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option, our net proceeds will 
be approximately $114.6 million. 

We expect to use approximately $32.0 million of the net proceeds of this 
offering as follows: 

. approximately $14.0 million for capital expenditures, consisting primarily of 
the build-out of our existing facilities; 

. approximately $10.0 million for working capital requirements; and 

. approximately $8.0 million for expansion of our sales and marketing efforts; 

We expect to use the remaining approximately $67.5 million of net proceeds for: 

. potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions; and 

. other general corporate purposes. 

As noted above, we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for 
the acquisition of businesses that complement our existing business strategy. 
However, we have no commitments or agreements with respect to any specific 
future acquisition, except that we recently signed a non-binding letter of 
intent to purchase a small software development firm in Toronto that provides 
intranet and Internet application development and systems integration services, 
subject to satisfactory due diligence and other contingencies. 

Management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of 
this offering. Pending the use of the net proceeds as described above, we 
intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in U.S. dollar denominated 
short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing instruments. Please see ""Risk 
Factors--Our management will have broad discretion with respect to the 
expenditure of the net proceeds from this offering, and may use the proceeds in 
ways that you disagree with"". We may be required by the government of India to 
repatriate the net proceeds from this offering as described in ""Risk Factors-- 
The government of India may require us to convert the proceeds of this offering 
into rupees and repatriate the proceeds to India, which could reduce the dollar 
value of the proceeds due to depreciation of the Indian rupee"". Subject to 
repatriation of the net proceeds to India, the Reserve Bank of India has 
granted general permission for us to: 

. invest the funds as an interim arrangement on a short term basis as deposits 
with foreign banks which are rated A1+ by Standard & Poor's or P1 by Moody's or 
with the branches of Indian banks located outside of India; 

. invest in U.S. treasury bills and other monetary instruments with maturities 
not exceeding a period of one year; 

. keep the funds as foreign currency deposits with authorized dealers and/or 
public financial institutions in India; and 

. invest in certificate of deposits or other commercial paper issued outside 
India by banks incorporated in India."

allotment option in full. In addition, we anticipate that we will borrow 
approximately $31.0 million under a proposed credit facility that we will enter 
into at or about the time of this offering. 

We intend to use the aggregate proceeds of this offering, including amounts we 
may receive from the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, and
 borrowings under the proposed credit facility and cash on hand to repay our 
indebtedness to Great Lakes, which we estimate to be approximately $116.0 
million. This indebtedness is payable upon demand and does not bear interest. 
The remaining balance, if any, owed to Great Lakes after this repayment will be 
contributed to us as equity capital from Great Lakes. In addition, our board of 
directors declared a dividend on our common stock which requires us to pay to 
Great Lakes proceeds from the offering in excess of amounts we otherwise owe to 
Great Lakes. After this offering and the related transactions, we will have

and fee and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, are approximately 
US$50.3 million (or US$58.0 million if the underwriters' overallotment option

the use of the proceeds from this offering, we currently estimate that we may 
use the proceeds from this offering to: 

- enhance our content and service offerings; 

- advertise and promote our brand; and 

- provide for general corporate purposes, including possible strategic 
investments, partnerships and acquisitions. 

While we have from time to time preliminarily discussed potential investments, 
strategic partnerships and acquisitions in the ordinary course of our business, 
we have no current agreements relating to any such transaction. 

We have not yet determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically 
for the purposes specified above. We historically have not, and cannot, 
accurately make any meaningful long-term estimates of the use of the proceeds 
from this offering and the priorities or contingencies affecting them due to 
the rapidly shifting focuses in our industry. For example, this year we shifted 
resources to institute new services for wireless subscribers in order to take 
advantage of market opportunities created to address new technologies in 
wireless content delivery. These spending plans did not exist last year. 
Similarly, market response to new initiatives, which can be instantaneous in 
the Internet, also determine our focus and spending efforts on a particular 
project. Additionally, our spending will also depend on our ability to raise 
additional financing, if and when it may become necessary. Accordingly, 
management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of 
this offering. Management will not, however, be able to use the proceeds to 
purchase real estate or to purchase securities on stock exchanges as specified
 by the Ministry of Finance of India. Additionally, we will not be able to use 
the proceeds of this offering for overseas acquisitions or investments without 
the prior approval of the Government of India. We will be required to submit to 
the Reserve Bank of India and the Ministry of Finance quarterly statements with 
regard to the periodic repatriation of the net proceeds of this offering. 

Pending repatriation of the issue proceeds to India we are permitted to invest 
the net proceeds in the following: 

- short term deposits in foreign banks which are rated A1+ by Standard & Poor 
or P1 by Moody's or with the branches of Indian banks abroad, or; 

- treasury bills and other monetary instruments, the maturity period of which 
does not exceed one year, or; 

- foreign currency deposits maintained with authorized dealers and/or public 
financial institutions in India, or; 

- Certificate(s) of Deposit or other paper issued outside India by Indian 
banks."

any proceeds from the sale of 495,000 shares of common stock by the selling

million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, at an 
initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for additional 
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including increased 
expenditures for research and development, sales and marketing, and selling, 
general and administrative. The amounts and timing of these expenditures will 
vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated 
by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of 
growth, if any, of our business. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds 
to acquire additional businesses, products and technologies, to lease 
additional facilities, or to establish joint ventures that we believe will 
complement our current or future business. However, we have no specific plans,
 agreements or commitments to do so and are not currently engaged in any 
negotiations for any business acquisition or joint venture. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and 
financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a 
public market for our common stock. As of the date of this prospectus, we 
cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds 
of this offering. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion in the 
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described 
above, we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in short term interest 
bearing, investment-grade securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds 
will be invested to yield a favorable return. We believe that our available
 cash, together with the net proceeds of this offering and revenue to be
 derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our capital 
requirements at least through 2001."

expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions of $18.4 million, to be 
approximately $225.4 million. We will use these proceeds to repay senior debt 
outstanding under our credit agreement with The Chase Manhattan Bank and other 
lenders in the following priority: debt under our revolving credit facility and 
debt under our acquisition loan facility. Based upon our senior debt 
outstanding as of March 31, 2000, we will use these proceeds to repay 
approximately $145.0 million of senior debt under our revolving credit facility 
and $80.4 million of senior debt under our acquisition loan facility. These 
amounts include approximately $106.7 million of senior debt held by affiliates 
of the underwriters. The revolving credit facility and acquisition loan 
facility expire December 31, 2002. As of March 31, 2000, the effective interest 
rate for the revolving credit facility and acquisition loan facility was 8.19%. 

Any net proceeds received by us from the exercise by the underwriters of their 
over-allotment option will also be used to repay our senior debt in accordance 
with the priority specified above. 

We expect to borrow under the revolving credit facility as needed to fund our 
working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. We also expect to 
borrow under the acquisition loan facility as needed to fund the acquisition of 
additional hospitals. See ""Business of Community Health Systems--Our Business

(1) On February 25, 2000, we issued in a private placement to DLJ Merchant 
Banking Partners II, L.P., $25.0 million of our Series B preferred stock which 
is convertible automatically into shares of our common stock upon the 
completion of this offering. 

(2) On April 11, 2000, we issued 300,000 units consisting of $300,000,000 
principal amount of senior subordinated discount notes, generating gross 
proceeds of approximately $152.3 million, and warrants to purchase 3,579,000 
shares of our common stock. 

(3) On March 31, 2000, we signed a senior credit agreement with Paribas to 
provide a senior credit facility for up to $250.0 million of borrowings that 
replaced our prior $25.0 million credit facility. Through December 31, 2003, we 
expect to borrow $195.0 million of the $250.0 million available under the 
senior credit facility. Borrowings under our senior credit facility will be 
initially funded into an escrow account and not released to us until specified 
conditions have been satisfied. See ""Risk Factors--Other Risks Particular to 
Us."" 

(4) Debt repayment is composed of repayment of senior subordinated debt of 
$8.0 million, an $80,000 prepayment premium and approximately $300,000 of 
accrued interest. The senior subordinated debt was incurred in December 1999 to 
fund working capital requirements and the build-out of our Reno/Tahoe/Northern 
California market. This debt consisted of a 10-year note with annual interest 
rate at 12%. We granted warrants to purchase 4,978,150 shares of our common 
stock at $0.005 per share in connection with this debt. We allocated $2.2 
million of the $8.0 million proceeds from this debt to the warrants. 
(5) The holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends at a 
rate of 7% per year. We have not paid any dividends to our holders of preferred 
stock as of the date of this prospectus. Our preferred stock will convert into 
common stock on a one-for-one basis upon completion of this offering and, upon 
conversion, we will be required to pay all accrued dividends. 

(6) Fees and expenses include estimated offering expenses and underwriting 
discounts and commissions for this offering, expenses associated with the 
preferred stock investment, fees and expenses associated with our senior 
subordinated discount notes and origination and other fees and expenses related 
to our senior credit facility. 

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of this offering, the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and 
senior subordinated discount notes and borrowings under our senior credit 
facility based upon our current markets and our current plans for these 
markets. Actual expenditures may vary substantially from these estimates and we 
may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate the net proceeds from these 
sources within the above-described categories or to use portions thereof for 
other purposes. 

We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds of this offering for general 
corporate purposes. Pending such uses, we expect to invest the net proceeds 
from the sale of the common stock in short-term investment grade securities 
which will earn interest."

    Our restaurants will be constructed for us by developers on a build-to-suit
 lease basis. We estimate that the build-out cost for two new Granite City Food 
& Brewery restaurants will be approximately $4,110,000, of which $3,348,750 will 
be provided by this offering. Such estimate consists of the following components:
 (a) $1,730,000 for restaurant development costs, improvements and licenses, of 
which $1,449,375 will be provided by this offering, (b) $1,930,000 in equipment
 costs, of which $1,449,375 will be provided by this offering, (c) $350,000 in
 pre-opening costs which will be provided by this offering, and (d) $100,000 in 
inventory costs which will be provided by this offering. We anticipate financing 
the difference between the build-out cost of such restaurants and the net proceeds 
of this offering through long-term building and equipment leases of approximately 
$761,250. This amount will vary depending upon whether the over-allotment option 
is exercised. If the over-allotment option is exercised, we expect to use the net 
proceeds we receive to reduce the amount of building and equipment financing. 
Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the purposes described above,
 we intend to invest such proceeds in short-term, income-producing investments. 
    Our actual costs to develop the two new restaurants may differ from these 
estimates depending upon, among other things, final designs, licensing and local 
law compliance, real estate acquisition costs and construction labor rates. We
 will develop restaurants only where we obtain satisfactory construction and 
leasing arrangements with a developer. 
    We have entered into a letter of intent for the development of a restaurant
 site in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. We expect to enter into agreements relating
 to the development and lease of this restaurant when we or our developer secure 
all necessary permits and licenses. We are currently in the process of identifying 
and securing a site in Fargo, North Dakota. In both Sioux Falls and Fargo, we
 plan to enter into build-to-suit lease arrangements and develop the properties 
similar to the way we developed our Granite City Food & Brewery restaurant in St.
 Cloud, Minnesota. 
    Restaurant development costs, improvements and licenses includes $152,500 
which we borrowed from New Brighton Ventures, Inc. in February 2000 and used to 
purchase a liquor license in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. This indebtedness is
 evidenced by a promissory note that matures in August 2000 and bears interest 
at the rate of 8% per year. We also received a $25,000 advance from New Brighton 
Ventures which we have paid to our underwriter in connection with this offering.

 lease basis. We estimate that the build-out cost for two new Granite City Food 
& Brewery restaurants will be approximately $4,110,000, of which $3,348,750 will 
be provided by this offering. Such estimate consists of the following components:
 (a) $1,730,000 for restaurant development costs, improvements and licenses, of 
which $1,449,375 will be provided by this offering, (b) $1,930,000 in equipment
 costs, of which $1,449,375 will be provided by this offering, (c) $350,000 in
 pre-opening costs which will be provided by this offering, and (d) $100,000 in 
inventory costs which will be provided by this offering. We anticipate financing 
the difference between the build-out cost of such restaurants and the net proceeds 
of this offering through long-term building and equipment leases of approximately 
$761,250. This amount will vary depending upon whether the over-allotment option 
is exercised. If the over-allotment option is exercised, we expect to use the net 
proceeds we receive to reduce the amount of building and equipment financing. 
Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the purposes described above,
 we intend to invest such proceeds in short-term, income-producing investments. 
    Our actual costs to develop the two new restaurants may differ from these 
estimates depending upon, among other things, final designs, licensing and local 
law compliance, real estate acquisition costs and construction labor rates. We
 will develop restaurants only where we obtain satisfactory construction and 
leasing arrangements with a developer. 
    We have entered into a letter of intent for the development of a restaurant
 site in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. We expect to enter into agreements relating
 to the development and lease of this restaurant when we or our developer secure 
all necessary permits and licenses. We are currently in the process of identifying 
and securing a site in Fargo, North Dakota. In both Sioux Falls and Fargo, we
 plan to enter into build-to-suit lease arrangements and develop the properties 
similar to the way we developed our Granite City Food & Brewery restaurant in St.
 Cloud, Minnesota. 
    Restaurant development costs, improvements and licenses includes $152,500 
which we borrowed from New Brighton Ventures, Inc. in February 2000 and used to 
purchase a liquor license in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. This indebtedness is
 evidenced by a promissory note that matures in August 2000 and bears interest 
at the rate of 8% per year. We also received a $25,000 advance from New Brighton 
Ventures which we have paid to our underwriter in connection with this offering.
 We intend to repay our indebtedness to New Brighton Ventures with a portion of
 the net proceeds of this offering."

us in this offering will be approximately $54.5 million, or approximately $62.9 
million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, based 
on the initial public offering price of $10 per share, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
increase our financial flexibility and to create a public market for our common 
stock. We presently intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this 
offering for the following purposes: 

- the creation of new and expansion of existing client service centers, 
including capital expenditures for equipment and leasehold improvements; 

- the expansion of our technology infrastructure; 

- the repayment of indebtedness related to our acquisition of Gunn Partners in 
November 1999 (approximately $9.1 million was outstanding at March 31, 2000); 
and 

- the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities, principally related to 
additional personnel and increased promotional activities. 

We also plan to use an unspecified portion of the net proceeds of this offering 
to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services or technologies. Our 
acquisitions may include certain facilities or other assets from our clients as 
we assume their HR processes. From time to time, in the ordinary course of 
business, we evaluate potential acquisitions of these businesses, assets, 
services or technologies. We are not currently negotiating any material 
probable acquisitions. Prior to the commencement of this offering, we conducted 
preliminary discussions with various third parties about potential business 
transactions including acquisitions. We stopped acquisition negotiations when 
we decided to pursue this offering. We do not have any commitment to effect any 
acquisition, and we do not consider any of the acquisitions we previously 
discussed to be probable because, among other reasons, we have not agreed upon 
any of the essential terms of any acquisition, including price, and we have not 
yet submitted such acquisition to our board of directors for approval. After 
this offering, we expect to consider various potential acquisitions, which may 
include companies we previously considered, as well as other companies with 
which we have not had prior contact. However, we cannot provide any assurance 
that we will be able to complete any acquisitions, or that any acquisitions we 
may complete will enhance our business. 

We have no specific plans at this time for use of the remaining proceeds and 
expect to use these proceeds for working capital and general corporate 
purposes. Our management will have broad discretion concerning the allocation 
and use of a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending 
the use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest these 
proceeds in short-term, investment grade, interest bearing securities. 

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered by this prospectus based 
upon the current state of our business operations, our current plans for 
expansion and the current economic and industry conditions. The net proceeds 
are subject to reallocation among the categories stated above. The amount or 
timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including 
our profitability, the availability of alternative financing, our business 
development activities and competition."
