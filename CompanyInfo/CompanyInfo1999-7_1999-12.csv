underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We 
currently expect to use the net proceeds primarily for working capital and 
general corporate purposes, including funding product development and expanding 
our sales and marketing organization. We have not yet determined the actual 
expected expenditures and thus cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each 
of these purposes. The amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary 
depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated by our 
operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, 
if any, of our business. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds 
for further development of our product lines through acquisitions of products, 
technologies and businesses. Accordingly, although we have no present 
commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions, management 
will have significant discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering.

 the bank's prime rate or London Interbank Overnight Rate plus 2% annually, and
 the credit line expires on July 1, 2000. This debt was used for working capital

We expect to spend up to $1,900,000 over the next 12 to 18 months for research 
and development of our Web products. Most of these funds will be used to hire 
and train engineers and programming staff experienced in developing Internet 
and Web-based software products. We also expect to spend up to $600,000 during 
the same period to hire additional staff who will be mainly devoted to making 
ongoing refinements and enhancements to our existing products. We have budgeted 
$950,000 to expand our marketing and sales efforts by 

- increasing amounts devoted to advertising within trade and industry magazines 
and other print media, and 

- hiring up to 15 additional persons who will engage in business development,
 sales, and customer support. 

We expect to spend up to $150,000 for intellectual property protection over the 
next 12 to 18 months. We anticipate that most of this amount will be spent for 
legal fees and costs in connection with 

- domestic and foreign applications for patents on portions of our technology 
which may be patentable, 

- trademarks, servicemarks and copyrights. 

As of July 1, 1999 we had fully utilized our $250,000 bank credit line. The 
credit line bears interest at 10% per year, is due August 1, 1999, is 
guaranteed by Glenn P. Russell, our president, and is collateralized by our 
accounts receivable. We used the proceeds of this credit line for general 
corporate purposes and working capital. 

In July 1999 we obtained a commitment for a short-term loan of up to $200,000 
from Spencer Edwards, Inc., our underwriter. As of July 15, 1999 the 
underwriter has advanced us $175,000 which we have used for general corporate 
purposes and working capital. The loan bears interest at 10% per year and is 
payable on the earlier of either October 6, 1999 or our receipt of the proceeds 
from this offering. 

We may acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or 
products and a portion of the net proceeds currently allocated to other 
corporate purposes including working capital may be used for such acquisitions 
or investments. However, we currently have no understandings, commitments or 
agreements for any material acquisition or investment. 
The description above represents our best estimate of the uses of the net 
proceeds to be received in this offering, based on current planning and 
business conditions. The precise allocation of funds among the uses described 
above will depend on 

- the amount of cash generated by our operations, 

- future technological developments, 

- the competitive climate in which we operate, and 

- the emergence of future opportunities. 

We believe that our existing capital resources and the net proceeds of this 
offering will be sufficient to maintain current and planned operations for a 
period of at least 18 months from the date of this prospectus. Net proceeds not 
immediately required for the purposes described above will be invested 
principally in investment grade, interest-bearing securities."

of the 3,500,000 shares of common stock sold by us in this offering, at the 
initial public offering price of $13.00 per share, and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses to be paid by us. 
We will not receive any proceeds from any shares sold by the selling 
stockholders. 

We will use approximately $3.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering 
to repay all debt to entities affiliated with Matrix IV Management Co., L.P., 
OVMC III, L.P. and OVMC IV, LLC. As of June 30, 1999, the outstanding principal 
balance on this loan was $3.0 million. This debt matures on March 9, 2000 and 
bears interest at the rate of 6% per year. 

In addition, we will use up to $4.25 million of the net proceeds to repay our 
bridge loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank. As of June 30, 1999, the 
outstanding principal balance on this loan facility was $3.6 million, but we 
may borrow the remaining $650,000 available under this loan facility before the 
completion of this offering. This debt matures on the earlier of the closing 
date of our initial public offering or August 26, 1999 and bears interest at 
prime plus 2%, which was 9.75% as of June 30, 1999. 

We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds primarily for additional 
working capital and other general corporate purposes. The amounts that we 
actually spend for working capital purposes will vary significantly depending 
on a number of factors, including any future revenue growth, the amount of cash 
we generate from operations and the progress of our product development 
efforts. Although we have no present plans, agreements or proposals to do so, 
we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to license or acquire new 
products or technologies or to acquire or invest in businesses complementary to 
our own. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in allocating the net 
proceeds from this offering. Pending their use, we will invest the net proceeds 
in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

community and syndicated community offerings of between approximately 
$8,520,000 and $11,813,000, which will be used as follows: 

. $5.1 million to repay indebtedness which NCRIC Group incurred in connection 
with the HealthCare Consulting acquisition. This includes repayment of bank 
debt of $2.2 million and $2.9 million that NCRIC Group borrowed from NCRIC, 
Inc. 

. a loan to the ESOP in the amount necessary to purchase 10% of the shares of 
common stock sold in the subscription, community and syndicated community 
offerings. The amount of the ESOP loan may range from $952,000 to $1,288,000. 
NCRIC Group anticipates that the ESOP loan will have a ten-year term with a 
floating interest rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street 
Journal from time to time. The ESOP loan will be repaid principally from NCRIC, 
Inc.'s contributions to the ESOP and dividends, if any, on unallocated shares. 
NCRIC Group will use the funds received from the ESOP for general corporate 
purposes. 

. a loan to the stock award plan in the amount necessary to purchase 5% of the 
shares of common stock sold in the subscription, community and syndicated 
community offerings. The amount of the stock plan loan may range from $476,000 
to $644,000. NCRIC Group anticipates that the stock plan loan will have a five-
year term with a floating interest rate equal to the prime rate as published in 
The Wall Street Journal from time to time. The stock plan loan will be repaid 
principally from NCRIC, Inc.'s contributions to the stock award plan. Upon 
receipt of funds from the stock award plan, NCRIC Group will use the funds for 
general corporate purposes. 

. NCRIC Group will retain the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes, including the expansion and diversification of NCRIC's activities. 
Until used, the funds will be invested primarily in U.S. Government securities, 
federal agency securities and other interest-bearing securities. NCRIC Group 
also may use a portion of the net proceeds of the subscription, community and 
syndicated community offerings to fund the purchase of a maximum of 92,000 
shares of common stock, in the open market, for use in connection with the 
stock option plan. 

The amount of proceeds from the sale of common stock in the subscription, 
community and syndicated community offerings will depend upon the total number 
of shares actually sold, the relative percentages of common stock sold in the 
subscription, community and syndicated community offerings and the actual 
expenses of the offerings. As a result, the net proceeds from the sale of 
common stock cannot be determined until the subscription, community and 
syndicated community offerings are completed. Set forth below are the uses of 
the estimated net proceeds to NCRIC Group, assuming the sale of common stock at 
the minimum, midpoint and maximum.

With the exception of the HealthCare Consulting acquisition, the ESOP loan, the 
stock plan loan and the possible acquisition of common stock in connection with 
the stock option plan, NCRIC Group currently has no specific plans, 
arrangements or understandings regarding the use of the net proceeds from the 
subscription, community and syndicated community offerings. In the judgment of 
NCRIC Group's board of directors, it is not necessary to utilize any of the 
proceeds of the subscription, community and syndicated community offerings to 
improve the quality of NCRIC, Inc.'s medical professional liability insurance

community and syndicated community offerings of between approximately 
$8,520,000 and $11,813,000, which will be used as follows: 

. $5.1 million to repay indebtedness which NCRIC Group incurred in connection 
with the HealthCare Consulting acquisition. This includes repayment of bank 
debt of $2.2 million and $2.9 million that NCRIC Group borrowed from NCRIC, 
Inc. 

. a loan to the ESOP in the amount necessary to purchase 10% of the shares of 
common stock sold in the subscription, community and syndicated community 
offerings. The amount of the ESOP loan may range from $952,000 to $1,288,000. 
NCRIC Group anticipates that the ESOP loan will have a ten-year term with a 
floating interest rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street 
Journal from time to time. The ESOP loan will be repaid principally from NCRIC, 
Inc.'s contributions to the ESOP and dividends, if any, on unallocated shares. 
NCRIC Group will use the funds received from the ESOP for general corporate 
purposes. 

. a loan to the stock award plan in the amount necessary to purchase 5% of the 
shares of common stock sold in the subscription, community and syndicated 
community offerings. The amount of the stock plan loan may range from $476,000 
to $644,000. NCRIC Group anticipates that the stock plan loan will have a five-
year term with a floating interest rate equal to the prime rate as published in 
The Wall Street Journal from time to time. The stock plan loan will be repaid 
principally from NCRIC, Inc.'s contributions to the stock award plan. Upon 
receipt of funds from the stock award plan, NCRIC Group will use the funds for 
general corporate purposes. 

. NCRIC Group will retain the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes, including the expansion and diversification of NCRIC's activities. 
Until used, the funds will be invested primarily in U.S. Government securities, 
federal agency securities and other interest-bearing securities. NCRIC Group 
also may use a portion of the net proceeds of the subscription, community and 
syndicated community offerings to fund the purchase of a maximum of 92,000 
shares of common stock, in the open market, for use in connection with the 
stock option plan. 

The amount of proceeds from the sale of common stock in the subscription, 
community and syndicated community offerings will depend upon the total number 
of shares actually sold, the relative percentages of common stock sold in the 
subscription, community and syndicated community offerings and the actual 
expenses of the offerings. As a result, the net proceeds from the sale of 
common stock cannot be determined until the subscription, community and 
syndicated community offerings are completed. Set forth below are the uses of 
the estimated net proceeds to NCRIC Group, assuming the sale of common stock at 
the minimum, midpoint and maximum.

offering, after deducting estimated expenses of $1.1 million and underwriting 
discounts and commissions, will be approximately $140.3 million, or 
approximately $162.6 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full. We will use all of the proceeds from the offering to repay a 
portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term credit 
agreement. Borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility will be 
used: 

- to fund some of the cash portion of the purchase of additional dealers and 
for other acquisitions; 

- to provide working capital for our expanded operations; 

- to fund capital expenditures; and 

- for other general corporate purposes. 

As of July 1, 1999 approximately $120 million was outstanding under our 
revolving credit facility at an average interest rate of 5.2% and approximately 
$90 million was outstanding under our term credit agreement at an interest rate 
of 6.0%. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term credit 
agreement, along with cash flow from operations, were used for: 

- seasonal working capital needs; 

- the acquisitions of the hearth products companies; 

- the acquisitions of heating and air conditioning dealers in Canada; 

- certain international acquisitions, including McQuay do Brasil S.A.; 

- the acquisition of Livernois Engineering Holding Company and its licensed

RECRUITING, TRAINING AND EQUIPPING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
PROFESSIONALS. Represents anticipated costs associated with hiring additional 
information technology professionals. We believe that we must hire and keep on 
staff a sufficient number of information technology professionals so that we 
may be able to respond quickly to the demands of our customers. 
EXPANDING OUR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. Represents costs 
associated with recruiting and compensating additional management personnel and 
the purchase of information systems and equipment to manage our planned growth. 

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES. Represents costs associated with advertising and 
other promotional activities designed to increase market awareness of our 
company and its services, including recruiting, compensating and incremental 
travel expenses associated with additional sales and marketing personnel to 
expand our number of software company partners. 

EXPANDING OUR PHYSICAL FACILITIES. Represents costs associated with obtaining 
larger office space and possible additional offices to accommodate our planned 
growth. 

REPAYMENT OF DEBT AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. Represents anticipated payments of 
outstanding debt and accounts payable following the offering. 

WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. Represents funds that may be 
used, among other things, to pay salaries, rent, trade payables, professional 
fees and other operating expenses. If opportunities arise, these funds may be 
used to acquire complementary businesses. We have no present understandings, 
commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition. 

The allocation of the net proceeds from this offering set forth above 
represents an estimate based upon our currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to our operations, as well as assumptions that general economic 
conditions remain approximately the same. If any of these factors change, we 
may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds among 
categories or to use portions for other purposes. 

We anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to fund 
our operations and capital requirements for at least 12 months following this 
offering. We cannot assure you, however, that the proceeds of this offering 
will not be expended earlier due to unanticipated changes in economic 
conditions or other circumstances that we cannot foresee. In the event our 
plans change or our assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate, we could be 
required to seek additional financing sooner than currently anticipated. 
Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from 
this offering in government securities and other short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing instruments. 

Please also see ""Risk Factors--We may invest or spend the proceeds of this 
offering in ways with which you may not agree."""

There is no minimum number of units that must be sold in the offering, and all 
funds will be paid directly to Cardinal. Since there are no minimum proceeds we
 may not be able to do anything discussed in this section. 
In the event all units offered herein are sold, Cardinal would receive $17,050,000 
of net proceeds from this offering after deduction of possible fees paid to 
qualified broker-dealers and expenses of this offering. The net proceeds of this 
offering will be used for: 
o expenditures for deposits and down payments on aircraft, equipment and inventory; 
o development of maintenance and technical programs designed to comply with federal
 regulatory requirements; 
o federal certification expenses; 
o identifying, hiring and training of necessary labor force; and 
o working capital and general corporate purposes. 
The amounts and timing of expenditures for each purpose is subject to the broad
 discretion of the management and will depend on factors such as the amount of
 net proceeds available to Cardinal and the effects of competition, many of 
which are beyond Cardinal's control. If only 5,000 or fewer units are sold, the
 result would be that all the proceeds would be used to pay offering expenses
 and Cardinal would attempt to obtain additional funding to continue implementing 
Cardinal's business plans as discussed in this prospectus. 
Because Cardinal has no minimum proceeds in this offering, it is possible that
 Cardinal will receive no funds or insufficient funds to enable it to effectuate 
its planned use of proceeds set forth above. 
Until required for operations, our policy is to invest our cash reserves in bank 
deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. government 
instruments, and other investment-grade quality instruments. 
Cardinal will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common
 stock by the selling shareholders. 
The following table represents Cardinal's use of proceeds from the sale of units 
in this offering. The columns for the unit sales of 30% and greater include startup 
costs and 90 days of revenue flight operations. This is to meet the DOT Certification 
requirements of sufficient resources to cover all pre-operating costs plus the
 operating costs incurred by Cardinal during the first 3 months of normal operations.

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of $1.3 
million. The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional 
working capital. 

We currently expect to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

- An estimated $20 to $25 million of the net proceeds may be used to meet our 
capital contribution obligations to NBC/Quokka Ventures, LLC and CART Digital 
Media Enterprises, LLC. The terms of the operating agreement for NBC/Quokka 
Ventures, LLC require us to make quarterly capital contributions in amounts 
necessary to fund the venture's operations on an ongoing basis in accordance 
with the annual operating plan. With respect to CART Digital Media Enterprises, 
LLC, we expect to make capital contributions in order to meet our 50% share of 
the venture's need for operating capital. Accordingly, the amounts and timing 
of these capital contributions to be made by us with respect to each of NBC/
Quokka Ventures, LLC and CART Digital Media Enterprises, LLC will be based on 
the actual activities of each venture and are unknown at this time. 

- A portion of the net proceeds will be used to meet our obligations under 
current programming rights and distribution agreements. Under these agreements, 
we are required to make cash payments through 2003 totaling $16.3 million. 

- A portion of the net proceeds may be used for the repayment of indebtedness. 
In particular, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to repay approximately 
$646,000 of indebtedness outstanding under an equipment financing arrangement 
with a bank. The terms of this agreement require monthly repayments of 
principal and interest at 8.5% over 36 months commencing November 1998 and 
terminating October 2001. In addition, we may also use a portion of the net 
proceeds to repay certain other outstanding long-term equipment financing 
arrangements of approximately $400,000. Terms of these agreements call for 
monthly principal and interest payments through March 2004 at approximately 
9.5% interest. 

- The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate 
purposes, including an estimated $6 to $8 million for purchases of capital 
equipment, an estimated $11 to $13 million for leasehold improvements and an 
estimated $7 to $12 million for our expanded marketing campaign. Other general 
corporate purposes include expansion of our network production operations, 
license or acquisition of additional programming and distribution rights, 
creation of programming associated with these rights and establishment of 
additional joint ventures. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we have no specific plan detailing the 
amount of the proceeds to be used for each of the purposes described above and 
cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds to be 
received upon completion of this offering. We have estimated some of our uses 
of proceeds above but these estimates may not be accurate, and our actual use 
of proceeds may vary from these estimates. To the extent the net proceeds from 
this offering are not sufficient for the uses described above, we may use a 
portion of the net proceeds from our recent private sale of Series D preferred 
stock for these described uses. Our management will have broad discretion in 
the application of the net proceeds. Pending such uses, the net proceeds will 
be primarily invested in short-term, interest bearing obligations, investment 
grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations

operations and to continue expanding our product offerings. We have not yet 
determined our expected use of these proceeds but we currently anticipate that 
we will incur at least $5.0 million in research and development expenses, $13.0 
million in sales and marketing expenses and $2.5 million in general and 
administrative expenses over the next twelve months. Actual expenditures may 
vary substantially from these estimates. The amounts and timing of our actual 
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the status of our 
product development efforts, marketing and sales activities, and the amount of 
cash generated by our operations and competition. We may find it necessary or 
advisable to use portions of the proceeds for other purposes. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary 
businesses, products or technologies. From time to time, we evaluate these 
potential acquisitions and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations. 
We have no current plans, agreements or commitments with respect to any such 
acquisitions. Pending any of these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

processes and process development, scale-up and start-up of manufacturing 
activities for our other pharmaceutical product programs. We estimate that this 
use will require approximately $22.0 million. 

. For research, development, clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities, 
including related equipment. We estimate that this use will require $26.0 
million. 

. General corporate purposes, including working capital. We estimate that this 
use will consume the remaining proceeds. 

A portion of the proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses or products or to obtain rights to use complementary 
technologies. 

We may require additional funds in the 12-month period following this offering 
to accelerate product programs or to undertake new initiatives or enter into 
collaborative arrangements. 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures for each of these purposes 
may vary significantly depending upon numerous factors, including the status of 
our product development efforts, regulatory approvals, competition, sales and 
marketing activities and market acceptance of our products. Pending use for 
these or other purposes, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering 
in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. See ""Risk Factors-

We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering according to the following 
approximate allocations: 

. $25 million to expand our network around the world, 

. $18 million to repay indebtedness and redeem preferred stock, 

. $20 million to fund marketing and advertising activities, and 

. any remaining proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Except as indicated, we cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for 
the net proceeds to be received from the offering or the amount to be used 
specifically with respect to any use. Accordingly, our management will have 
broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds. The expansion of our 
network will include operations centers in Los Angeles, New York and London. 
These centers will allow enhanced data transmission over our network, including 
live phone conversations, which will be necessary to support the launch of a 
number of our future services. We intend to invest much of the $25 million 
expansion plan for our network in the equipment and software for these centers. 

The indebtedness to be repaid accrues interest on principal at a per annum rate 
of 10%, and half of such indebtedness is due on June 30, 2003 and the other 
half is due on June 30, 2004, and the preferred stock to be redeemed 
accumulates dividends on stated amount and unpaid dividends at a per annum rate 
of 15%. The indebtedness consists of all our 10% senior subordinated notes due 
2004, which we issued in June 1998, and the preferred stock is all our Series A 
usable redeemable preferred stock, which we issued in July 1998. We issued this 
indebtedness and preferred stock to fund capital expenditures, to upgrade our 
network, to fund marketing and advertising expenses and to expand our user 
base. 

Prior to the application of the net proceeds from the offering as described 
above, the net proceeds from the offering will be invested in short-term 
marketable securities."

- the remaining amount of approximately $177.1 million (NLG 371.9 million) for 
acquisitions, working capital and other general corporate purposes, including 
the funding of operating deficits. 

The proceeds from the Third High Yield Offering will be used only to repay the 
Interim Loans and for acquisitions and the expansion of our network in a manner 
consistent with the terms of the indentures governing the Existing Notes.

will be approximately $54,800,000. Our estimated net proceeds will be 
$56,674,880 if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional 
shares in this offering. 

The principal purposes of this offering are: 

- to increase our equity capital 

- to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future 
access to public equity markets 

- to provide increased visibility and credibility in the marketplace 

- to provide liquidity to our existing stockholders 

- to enhance our ability to use our common stock as a means of attracting and 
retaining key employees 

- to enhance our ability to use our common stock as consideration for 
acquisitions 

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for repayment 
of bank debt and capital lease obligations. These bank debt and capital lease 
obligations totaled approximately $610,000 at March 31, 1999. For a description 
of the terms of the bank debt and capital lease obligations, see note 3 to our 
financial statements. We will use our remaining net proceeds for working 
capital and other general corporate purposes, including expansion of research 
and development, sales and marketing and capital expenditure activities. We 
have not yet determined our expected use of these proceeds, but we currently 
intend to use approximately $8.0 million from the net proceeds to expand our 
research and development activities, $17.0 million to expand our sales and 
marketing capabilities and $5.0 million for capital expenditures. The amounts 
and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors, 
including the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and 
technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. We 
may also use a portion of the net proceeds for possible acquisitions of 
businesses, products and technologies. From time to time we engage in 
discussions with potential acquisition candidates. However, we have no current 
plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions, and we may 
not make any acquisitions. 

We have not identified specific uses for a substantial portion of our net 
proceeds of this offering, and we will have discretion over their use and 
investment. Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest these proceeds 
in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities."

allotment option in full, we will receive an additional $6.3 million in net 
proceeds. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our equity capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate future access by us 
to the public equity markets and to provide increased visibility of Hoover's in 
a marketplace where many of our competitors are publicly-held companies. We 
currently intend to use up to approximately $10 million of the net proceeds of 
this offering for increased marketing activities. We expect to use the 
remainder of the net proceeds to extend our range of services in conjunction 
with our expansion of Hoover's Online and for other general corporate purposes, 
including expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the acquisition 
of complementary businesses and of content and distribution relationships. 
While there are no current commitments with respect to any material 
transactions, we evaluate acquisition opportunities from time to time. Pending 
such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in government securities and 
other short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

common stock offered by us will be approximately $527.5 million, or 
approximately $607.0 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to finance: 

o the Kentucky acquisition and the related fees which we estimate to be $335.0 
million; and 

o the introduction of new and enhanced products and services for our customers, 
other strategic acquisitions and general corporate activities which we estimate 
to be $192.5 million. 

You should read the discussion under ""Business--The Systems--The Kentucky 
Systems"" for further information concerning the Kentucky systems and ""Business-
-Products and Services--New and Enhanced Products and Services--Telephony"" for 
further information concerning the joint venture with AT&T. The amounts 
actually spent by us may vary significantly and will depend on a number of 
factors, including our future revenues and the other factors described under 
""Risk Factors."" We continually evaluate potential acquisition candidates, but 
we have not reached any agreements, commitments or understandings for any 
future acquisitions except for the Kentucky acquisition. There is no assurance 
that any additional acquisitions will be identified or completed. 

Pending our use of the net proceeds of this offering, we will temporarily 
eliminate the debt outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility 
(approximately $132.6 million) and the remainder will be invested in short-term 
investment grade investments. We expect that the Kentucky acquisition will be 
completed during the second half of 1999. There can be no assurance that the 
Kentucky acquisition will be completed on the terms described in this 
prospectus, or at all. This offering is not contingent or in any way dependent 
on the Kentucky acquisition. If the Kentucky acquisition is not completed, a 
significant portion of the net proceeds from this offering will not be 
designated for a specific use. See ""Risk Factors--The Kentucky acquisition may 
not be completed and if not completed, we will have the ability to apply some
 of the proceeds of this offering to fund as yet unidentified acquisitions, 
investments or joint ventures."" 

As of March 31, 1999, there was approximately $124.1 million outstanding under 
the Insight credit facility which has a final maturity in December 2005. For 
the quarter ended March 31, 1999, the interest rates for loans outstanding 
under the Insight credit facility ranged from approximately 7.0% to 7.4% and 
the weighted average interest rate as of March 31, 1999 was 7.2%. Loans 
obtained under the Insight credit facility during the past 12 months were for 
the rebuild of our cable network, the introduction of new and enhanced products 
and services for our customers, strategic acquisitions and general corporate 
activities. You should read the discussion under ""Description of Certain 
Indebtedness--Credit Facilities"" for further information about the Insight

senior credit facility with a number of lending institutions, including accrued

expected, from large pharmaceutical companies and pharmaceutical divisions of
chemical companies as well as biotechnology companies. This competition can be
expected to become more intense as commercial applications for biotechnology
products increase. Some competitors, primarily large pharmaceutical companies,
have greater clinical, regulatory and marketing resources and experience than we
do. Many of these companies have commercial arrangements with other companies in
the biotechnology industry to supplement their own research capabilities.
The introduction of new products or the development of new processes by
competitors or new information about existing products may result in price
reductions or product replacements, even for products protected by patents.
However, we believe our competitive position is enhanced by our commitment to
research leading to the discovery and development of new products and
manufacturing methods. Other factors which should help us meet competition
include ancillary services provided to
support our products, customer service, and dissemination of technical
information to prescribers of our products and to the health care community,
including payers.
Over the longer term, our and our collaborators' ability to successfully market
current products, expand their usage and bring new products to the marketplace
will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the effectiveness and
safety of the products, FDA and foreign regulatory agencies' approvals for new
indications, the degree of patent protection afforded to particular products,
and the effect of managed care as an important purchaser of pharmaceutical
products."

have committed, however, not to take any action to further the payment of any 
return of capital on the common stock during the one-year period subsequent to 
completion of the reorganization; and 

o expand or diversify our activities, as opportunities become available. 

Except with the prior approval of the New York Superintendent, neither Oswego 
County Bancorp nor Oswego County Savings may repurchase any of its outstanding 
common stock prior to the first anniversary of the completion of the offering. 
It is the policy of the New York Superintendent not to authorize any repurchases
in the first six months after the completion of an offering. During the second 
and third years following the offering, neither company may repurchase in excess
of five percent of its outstanding common stock in any 12-month period without 
the prior approval of the New York Superintendent. In determining whether to 
grant such approval, the New York Supertintendent considers: 

o financial condition and history of Oswego County Bancorp or Oswego County 
Savings, as the case may be; 

o the adequacy of its capital structure; 

o its future earnings prospects; 

o the quality of its management; 

o whether the repurchase will result in fair treatment to the shareholders of 
Oswego County Bancorp or Oswego County Savings, as the case may be; and 

o the public interest generally. 

Prior to authorizing a stock repurchase, Oswego County Bancorp's board of 
directors must determine that Oswego County Savings will have capital in excess 
of all applicable regulatory requirements upon completion of the repurchases. 

Oswego County Savings will use the portion of the net proceeds received by it 
in exchange for its capital stock to: 

o increase its funds used for general corporate purposes, and to continue to 
diversify its banking products, especially commercial business loans; and 

o further strengthen Oswego County Savings' capital position, which already 
exceeds all regulatory requirements. After the reorganization and stock 
offering, based upon the maximum of the estimated offering range, Oswego County 
Savings' core capital ratio will be approximately 11.9%. As a result, Oswego 
County Savings will continue to be a well-capitalized institution. 

The net proceeds will vary if total expenses of the reorganization and stock 
offering are more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary 
if the number of shares issued in the reorganization and stock offering is 
adjusted to reflect a change in the estimated pro forma market value of Oswego 
County Savings. Payments for shares made through the withdrawals from existing 
deposit accounts at Oswego County Savings will not result in the receipt of new
funds for investment by Oswego County Savings but will result in a reduction of
Oswego County Savings' interest expense and liabilities as funds are transferred
 from interest-bearing certificates or other deposit accounts."

offerings, after deducting estimated expenses of $4.2 million and underwriting 
discounts and commissions, all of which are payable by us, are estimated to be 
approximately $109.2 million, or approximately $124.5 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full. If 
the concurrent offering is not consummated, the aggregate net proceeds from our 
sale of common stock in the underwritten offering will be approximately $97.7 
million, or approximately $113.0 million if the underwriters exercise their 
option to purchase additional shares in full. The principal purposes of the 
offerings are to obtain additional capital, to create a public market for our 
common stock and to facilitate our future access to public securities markets. 

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from the offerings for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. In this 
regard, we currently expect that we will use approximately $5.0 million of the 
net proceeds in connection with the purchase of leasehold improvements at our 
headquarters in Palo Alto, California. In addition, we intend to use 
approximately $2.0 million of the net proceeds during the remainder of fiscal 
1999 for the purchase of computer equipment. We may also use a portion of the 
net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary services, products or 
technologies. We do not currently have any agreements or commitments with 
respect to any such transactions. Pending use of the net proceeds for the above 
purposes, we intend to invest such funds in short-term, interest-bearing 
obligations."

offered hereby are estimated to be $6,400,000, and $7,376,500 if the 
underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full, after deduction of 
the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The 
net proceeds have not been reduced by the amount of Suncoast Bancorp's 
organizational and other operating expenses which were approximately $128,333 
as of March 31, 1999 and $156,000 as of April 30, 1999. 

Suncoast Bancorp will use $6.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering to 
purchase all of the common stock of Suncoast National Bank, providing Suncoast 
National Bank's initial capitalization. Of the amount contributed to Suncoast 
National Bank, approximately $455,000 of these funds are expected to be used to 
construct leasehold improvements and buy necessary furniture, fixtures and 
equipment for Suncoast National Bank's office, and $100,000 is expected to be 
used to repay a portion of the line of credit previously used to begin 
construction of leaseholds and purchase furniture, fixtures and equipment. It 
is anticipated that the remaining amount will be used by Suncoast National Bank 
to fund investments in loans and U.S. government and agency securities, federal 
funds sold, and for payment of Suncoast National Bank's operating expenses. 

After capitalizing Suncoast National Bank as set forth above, the balance of 
the net proceeds of this offering, that will be retained by Suncoast Bancorp is 
estimated to be approximately $400,000. Of this amount, approximately $325,000 
will be used to repay a portion of the bank line of credit, the proceeds of 
which were used to pay the expenses of organizing Suncoast Bancorp and Suncoast 
National Bank. The line of credit is guaranteed by the directors of Suncoast 
Bancorp and Suncoast National Bank, provides for interest only payments at 
prime plus 1%, adjustable monthly, and matures on May 1, 1999. The remaining 
proceeds will initially be invested by Suncoast Bancorp in an overnight 
repurchase agreement with Suncoast National Bank secured by U.S. Treasury and 
Agency securities and otherwise will be held by Suncoast Bancorp as working 
capital for general corporate purposes as well as for possible future capital 
contributions to Suncoast National Bank to support asset growth. Such uses by 
Suncoast Bancorp, however, may be subject to change. Suncoast Bancorp believes 
that the net proceeds of the offering will satisfy Suncoast Bancorp's cash 
requirements for at least the first 12 month period following the opening of 
Suncoast National Bank. 

The following table illustrates the intended use by Suncoast Bancorp of the net 
proceeds of this offering:

At present, Suncoast National Bank anticipates that the portion of the 
$5,445,000 of funds available for loans to customers will be allocated to 
commercial and commercial real estate loans, residential lending, including 
residential construction, and to consumer lending, including home equity loans. 
Suncoast National Bank does not currently know the percentages that will be 
allocated to each of these lending categories, since Suncoast National Bank has 
not started operations and the allocation of loans will depend upon existing 
market conditions and customer demands. In addition, the amounts allocated to 
these general loan categories may vary from time to time."

Indian Village Bancorp has received conditional Office of Thrift Supervision 
approval to purchase all of the capital stock of Indian Village to be issued in 
the conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds of the stock offering. 
Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the common stock will 
increase Indian Village's capital and will support the expansion of Indian 
Village's existing business activities. Indian Village will use the funds 
contributed to it for general corporate purposes, including, initially, lending 
and investment in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations and U.S. 
government agency issued mortgage-backed securities. 

Indian Village Bancorp intends to loan the employee stock ownership plan the 
amount necessary to purchase 8% of the shares sold in the conversion. 
Accordingly, the employee stock ownership plan purchases would range between 
34,680 shares at the minimum of the offering range and 46,920 shares at the 
maximum of the offering range. At the midpoint of the offering range, the 
employee stock ownership plan would purchase 40,800 shares. If 674,475 shares 
are issued in the conversion, the employee stock ownership plan would purchase 
53,958 shares. It is anticipated that the employee stock ownership plan loan
 will have a 15-year term with interest payable at the prime rate as published 
in The Wall Street Journal on the closing date of the conversion. The loan will 
be repaid principally from Indian Village's contributions to the employee stock 
ownership plan and from any dividends paid on shares of common stock held by 
the employee stock ownership plan. 

The remaining net proceeds retained by Indian Village Bancorp initially will be 
invested primarily in short-term U.S. Government and agency obligations. These 
proceeds will be available for additional contributions to Indian Village in 
the form of debt or equity, to support future diversification or acquisition 
activities, as a source of dividends to the stockholders of Indian Village 
Bancorp and for future repurchases of common stock as permitted under 
Pennsylvania law and federal regulations. Indian Village Bancorp will consider 
exploring opportunities to use these funds to expand operations through 
acquiring or establishing additional branch offices or acquiring other 
financial institutions. Currently, there are no specific plans, arrangements, 
agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding any expansion 
activities. 

Except as described above, neither Indian Village Bancorp nor Indian Village 
has specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this offering. 
Although Indian Village's capital currently exceeds regulatory requirements, it 
is converting to stock form primarily to structure itself in the form of 
organization used by commercial banks and most other financial services 
companies. For a discussion of management's business reasons for undertaking 
the conversion, see ""The Conversion--Reasons for the Conversion."" 
Following the conversion, the Board of Directors will have the authority to 
adopt plans that meet statutory and regulatory requirements for repurchases of 
common stock. Since Indian Village Bancorp has not yet issued stock, there 
currently is insufficient information upon which an intention to repurchase 
stock could be based. The Board of Directors will consider many facts and 
circumstances in determining whether to repurchase stock in the future. These 
factors include market and economic factors such as the price at which the 
stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of 
other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved 
in the investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per 
share of the remaining outstanding shares, and the ability to improve Indian 
Village Bancorp's return on equity. The avoidance of dilution to stockholders 
by not having to issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options 
or to fund employee stock benefit plans is another factor that will be 
considered. The Board of Directors will also consider any other circumstances 
in which repurchases would be in the best interests of Indian Village Bancorp 
and its stockholders. 

Before any stock repurchases, the Board of Directors must determine that both 
Indian Village Bancorp and Indian Village will be capitalized in excess of all 
applicable regulatory requirements after any repurchases and that capital will 
be adequate, taking into account, among other things, Indian Village's level of 
nonperforming and classified assets, Indian Village Bancorp's and Indian 
Village's current and projected results of operations and asset/liability 
structure, the economic environment and tax and other regulatory 
considerations. For a discussion of the regulatory limitations applicable to 
stock repurchases, see ""The Conversion--Restrictions on Repurchase of Stock."""

(1) If the employee stock ownership plan buys shares in the market after the 
reorganization, the purchase price of those shares may be less or more than the 
$10.00 per share offering price, which will vary the amount of proceeds used 
for this purpose. 
The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the reorganization 
may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would 
increase if a syndicated community offering or underwritten public offering is 
used to sell shares not purchased in the subscription offering and community 
offering. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of shares to be sold in 
the offering is adjusted to reflect a change in the estimated pro forma market 
value of Hudson City Bancorp and Hudson City Savings. Payments for shares made 
through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result in the 
receipt of new funds for investment by Hudson City Savings, but will result in 
a reduction of Hudson City Savings' deposits and interest expense as funds are 
transferred from interest-bearing time deposits or other deposit accounts.

We currently plan to open as many as six new branch offices per year. We are 
currently evaluating a number of locations within our market area for 
prospective branch sites. Additionally, we will continue to consider growth

should arise. Since the unique characteristics of branch or whole institution 
acquisition transactions are currently unknown, we cannot determine the 
anticipated cost of these types of transactions. 

We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the transactions listed

- the sale of the 3,000,000 ordinary shares offered by us, at an initial public 
offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts 
and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us (which are 
estimated to be $5.8 million, or $6.3 million if the underwriters' over- 
allotment option is exercised in full) 

- and the sale of 1,344,086 ordinary shares to Go2Net and Vulcan Ventures in a 
concurrent private placement at a price of $14.88 per share in the concurrent 
private placement, 

are estimated to be $61.4 million ($68.1 million if the underwriters' over-

We intend to use the proceeds of this offering for the following: 

- expansion of our sales and marketing activities; 

- capital expenditures, including purchase of equipment, primarily for our 
hosting facilities; 

- expansion of research and development activities; 

- expansion of our international operations; and 

- working capital and other general corporate purposes.

generated by our operations and the market response to the introduction of any 
new service offerings. 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to

estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the sale of common stock of 
between $2,963,000 at the minimum and $4,782,000 at the maximum, as adjusted. 

Assuming the sale of $3,272,500, $3,850,000 and $4,427,500 of common stock at

These funds will initially be invested in U.S. government and federal agency 
securities, marketable securities, or a combination of both. We may also use the
net proceeds to repurchase our stock. See ""The Offering - Restrictions on 
Repurchases of Shares."" 

The funds received by Mechanics Savings from Steelton Bancorp in return for the 
purchase of all its stock to be issued will be used for general corporate 
purposes. The funds will increase Mechanics Savings' total capital to expand 
investment and lending within its existing market area and expansion of its 
consumer and commercial lending programs. The funds may also be used for an 
expansion of the Association's main office, including the installation of drive-
through facilities at that location. However, there are no current agreements or
arrangements regarding expansion. Net proceeds may also be used by the 
Association to make contributions to the employee stock ownership plan which in 
turn would be used to repay the loan from Steelton Bancorp. 

If the employee stock ownership plan does not purchase common stock in the 
offering, it may purchase shares of common stock in the market after the 
conversion. In the event the purchase price of the common stock is higher than 
$10.00 per share, the amount of proceeds required for the purchase by the 
employee stock ownership plan will increase and the resulting stockholders' 
equity will decrease. 

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion may be more 
or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of 
shares to be issued in the conversion are adjusted to reflect a change in the 
estimated pro forma market value of Steelton Bancorp and Mechanics Savings. 
Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing Mechanics Savings 
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by 
Mechanics Savings but will result in a reduction of its deposits and interest 
expense as funds are transferred from interest bearing certificates or other 
deposit accounts."

First Deposit has received conditional Office of Thrift Supervision approval to 
purchase all of our capital stock to be used in the conversion in exchange for 
50.0% of the net proceeds of the stock offering. The portion of net proceeds we 
receive from First Deposit will be added to our general funds to permit us to 
expand our lending and investment activities and to enhance customer services. 
We currently intend to utilize the net proceeds we receive for general corporate
purposes, including investment in loans and securities, as well as the possible 
construction of a new main office and the possible expansion of our facilities 
and operations through marketing, business development, or the acquisition or 
establishment of branch offices. We have no current arrangements, understandings
or agreements regarding any of these possible transactions. We anticipate that 
we will initially invest the net proceeds we receive in overnight funds and 
short-term investments with maturities of up to three years. To the extent that 
the stock-based benefit programs that we intend to adopt after the conversion 
are not funded with First Deposit's authorized but unissued common stock, First 
Deposit may use net proceeds from conversion to fund the purchase of stock on 
the open market to be awarded under these stock benefit programs. We have not 
yet determined the approximate amount of net proceeds to be used for any of the 
purposes mentioned above. See ""Management of Douglas Federal -- Benefit Plans.""

Our capital position substantially exceeds all regulatory requirements. Our 
primary purpose in converting is not to raise capital. Rather, one of the 
principal purposes for the conversion is to change our structure to the stock 
form used in the United States by all commercial banks, most major business 
corporations and most savings institutions. 

First Deposit intends to loan the employee stock ownership plan the amount 
necessary to purchase 8.0% of the shares sold in the conversion. Accordingly, 
the employee stock ownership plan purchases would range between 85,680 shares 
at the minimum of the offering range and 115,920 shares at the maximum of the 
offering range. At the midpoint of the offering range, the employee stock 
ownership plan would purchase 100,800 shares. It is anticipated that the 
employee stock ownership plan loan will have a 10-year term with interest 
payable at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the closing
date of the conversion. The loan will be repaid principally from our 
contributions to the employee stock ownership plan and from any dividends paid 
on shares of common stock held by the employee stock ownership plan. 

Ultimately, First Deposit may also use the net proceeds it retains to support 
the future expansion of operations through branch acquisitions, the 
establishment of branch offices, the acquisition of savings associations and 
commercial banks or their assets or diversification into other banking related 
businesses. We have no current arrangements, understandings or agreements 
regarding any such transactions. First Deposit may also use a portion of the net
proceeds it retains to engage in real estate development activities in its 
market area. Upon the conversion, First Deposit will be a unitary savings and 
loan holding company and will not be restricted in the types of business 
activities in which it may engage. See ""Regulation and Supervision -- Holding 
Company Regulations"" for a description of certain regulations applicable to 
First Deposit. First Deposit may also determine to pay dividends, repurchase 
common stock and fund the restricted stock program. See ""Dividend Policy."" 

In addition, under current policies, the Office of Thrift Supervision may allow 
repurchases in the first year following conversion and in amounts greater than 
5.0% in the second and third years following conversion if there are valid and 
compelling business reasons for such repurchases. 

Based upon facts and circumstances following the conversion and in compliance 
with applicable regulatory requirements, First Deposit's Board of Directors may 
repurchase stock in the future. Such facts and circumstances may include but not
be limited to: 

. economic factors such as the price at which the common stock is trading in the
market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and the opportunity to improve First Deposit's 
return on equity; 

. the avoidance of dilution to shareholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit
plans; and 

. any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in our best interest or 
the best interest of our shareholders. 

In the event First Deposit repurchases stock, such repurchases may be made at 
market prices which may be in excess of the purchase price in the conversion and
in excess of the per share book value. To the extent that First Deposit 
repurchases stock at market prices in excess of the per share book value, such 
repurchases may have a dilutive effect upon the interests of existing 
shareholders. Any stock repurchases will be subject to the Board of Directors' 
determination that we will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory
requirements after any such repurchases and that such capital will be adequate, 
taking into account, among other things, the level of non-performing and other 
risk assets, our current and projected results of operations and assets/
liability structure, the economic environment, tax and other considerations. See

Conversion."""

$73.4 million if the underwriters' over-allotment options are exercised in 
full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
expenses payable by us. 

We currently intend to use approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds of 
this offering for acquisitions. We are currently engaged in discussions with 
respect to several acquisitions. See ""Business -- Strategy"" and ""-- Acquisition 
Program."" We also expect to use the net proceeds as follows: 

- approximately $9.0 million for capital expenditures including completing and 
equipping our data centers; 

- $8.0 million for repayment of a 9% promissory note issued in favor of Matthew 
Wolf in connection with the acquisition of Interliant Texas, which will be paid 
in full on the consummation of this offering; and 

- $2.4 million for repayment of a promissory note, which pays interest at the 
prime rate, issued in connection with the acquisition of Advanced Web 
Creations, Inc., which will be paid in full on the consummation of this 
offering. 

See ""Business -- Technology and Network Operations -- Network Operations"" and 
""-- Facilities."" 

The balance of the net proceeds of this offering will be used for working 
capital and general corporate purposes. Pending use of the net proceeds for the 
above purposes, we intend to invest such funds in short-term investment grade 
interest-bearing securities. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 anticipate using net proceeds to expand our advertising, marketing and promotional 
efforts with our existing and future strategic marketing partners. Net proceeds
 may be used to support promotional inserts in direct mailings to Columbia House

 We intend to use net proceeds to maintain, back-up, and upgrade the technological

determined until the conversion is completed, it is presently anticipated that 
the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock will be between $2.5 million 
and $3.6 million ($4.1 million assuming an increase in the offering range by 
15%). See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion - How We Determined the Price Per
Share and the Offering Range"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such 
amounts. 

We will use the net proceeds from the offering as follows: 

o 8% will be loaned to our employee stock ownership plan to fund its purchase of
common stock 

o 50% will be used to purchase all of the common stock of Florida Parishes Bank 

o 42% will be retained by FPB Financial for general corporate purposes 


The loan to the ESOP will be $231,200 and $312,800 at the minimum and maximum of
the offering range. The ESOP will distribute the shares it purchases to our 
employees as the loan is repaid over 13 years. See ""Management - New Stock 
Benefit Plans - Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" 

The net proceeds we use to purchase the capital stock of the Bank will be used 
by the Bank for general corporate purposes, including increased lending 
activities. On a short-term basis, the Bank may purchase investment and mortgage
-backed securities. The net proceeds received by the Bank will further 
strengthen the Bank's capital position, which already exceeds all regulatory 
requirements. After the conversion, the Bank's tangible capital ratio will be 
9.6%, based upon the midpoint of the offering range. As a result, the Bank will 
continue to be a well-capitalized institution. 

The Bank projects that it may spend approximately $1.0 million in the Year 2000 
to build a new branch and make improvements to its existing office. The new 
branch is expected to be in the Hammond, Louisiana area and to have several 
drive-in banking lanes and a drive-in ATM lane. The projected improvements to 
the existing office include adding an ATM and an additional drive-in lane. The 
Bank believes that the improvements and the new office will assist in attracting
new customers. However, no site for the new office has been selected yet, and 
there can be no assurance that any new branch office will generate sufficient 
business to be profitable. 

We may initially use the remaining net proceeds retained by us to invest in 
mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and government-
sponsored enterprises, U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various
maturities, deposits in either the Bank or other financial institutions, or a 
combination thereof. The net proceeds retained by us may ultimately be used to: 

o support the Bank's lending activities, 

o support the future expansion of operations through establishment of branch 
offices or other customer facilities, expansion into other lending markets or 
diversification into other banking related businesses, although no such 
transactions are specifically being considered at this time, or 

o pay regular or special cash dividends, repurchase the common stock or pay 
returns of capital. 

Applicable conversion regulations require us to sell common stock in the 
conversion in an amount equal to our estimated pro forma market value, as 
determined by an independent appraisal. See ""The Conversion - How We Determined 
the Price Per Share and the Offering Range."" As a result, we may be required to 
sell more shares in the conversion than we may otherwise desire. To the extent 
we have excess capital upon completion of the conversion, we intend to consider 
stock repurchases, dividends and tax-free returns of capital to the extent 
permitted by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the ""OTS"") and deemed appropriate
by the Board of Directors. A return of capital is similar to a cash dividend, 
except for tax purposes it is an adjustment to your tax basis rather than income
to you. We have committed to the OTS that we will not take any action toward 
paying a tax-free return of capital during the first year after we complete the 
conversion. 

Stock repurchases will be considered by our Board of Directors after we complete
the conversion based upon then existing facts and circumstances, as well as 
applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Such facts and circumstances 
may include but not be limited to the following: 

o market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in
the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in our return on equity; 

o the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans; and 

o any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of
FPB Financial and our stockholders. 

No stock will be repurchased by us unless the Bank will continue to exceed all 
applicable regulatory requirements after the repurchases. The payment of 
dividends or repurchase of stock will be prohibited if the Bank's net worth 
would be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account to be 
established for the benefit of Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental 
Eligible Account Holders. As of the date of this prospectus, the initial balance
of the liquidation account would be approximately $3.6 million. See ""We Intend 
to Pay Quarterly Cash Dividends,"" ""The Conversion - Liquidation Rights of 
Certain Depositors"" and ""- Certain Restrictions on Purchase or Transfer of 
Shares After the Conversion."" 

We will be a unitary savings and loan holding company which, under existing 
laws, would generally not be restricted as to the types of business activities 
in which we may engage, provided that the Bank continues to be a qualified 
thrift lender (""QTL""). See ""Regulation - FPB Financial"" for a description of 
certain regulations applicable to us. However, the types of businesses in which 
we may engage may be restricted if pending legislation is adopted. See ""Risk 
Factors - Our Operations Are Subject to Regulatory and Legislative Changes."" 

Our net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion may be more 
or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of 
shares to be issued in the conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in the 
estimated pro forma market value of the Bank. Payments for shares made through 
withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at the Bank will not result in the 
receipt of new funds for investment by the Bank but will result in a reduction 
of the Bank's interest expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from 
interest-bearing certificates or other deposit accounts."
SUN COMMUNITY BANCORP LTD,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/sun-community-bancorp-ltd-2298-4963,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/sun-community-bancorp-ltd-2298-4963,424B4,7/2/1999,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=625991,"The net proceeds to Sun from the offering (after deducting estimated expenses 
of the offering, which are expected to be $510,000) are estimated to be 
approximately $25 million. It is currently expected that the net proceeds from 
the offering will be used by Sun for investment in bank and bank holding 
company subsidiaries to fund the development and growth of new or existing 
banks, including expansion into new geographic markets, as part of Sun's growth 
strategy. Pending application of the net proceeds described above, Sun 
currently intends to place such funds as deposits at affiliated or unaffiliated 
banks or invest in high-grade investment securities. 

In Sun's recent experience, newly-formed banks in Arizona have been required by 
bank regulators to have initial capitalization of not less than $4.2 million. 
Since state-chartered banks are formed under differing state rules, new banks 
in states other than Arizona may require more or less than that amount and 
those requirements could change, including requirements in Arizona. If Sun 
purchases at least 51% of the new bank's common stock it will invest at least 
$2,397,000 in each new bank if the required capital for the new bank is $4.7 
million. In addition to its investment in a new bank, Sun may also fund some of 
the bank's preopening and start-up costs before it opens, which could 
approximate between $150,000 and $300,000. Sun anticipates that its currently 
planned banks will have average initial capital of $4.7 million and that Sun 
will purchase at least 51% of each bank's common stock. See ""Recent 
Developments."" 

Other than the pending bank applications and the second bank currently planned 
to be developed in Nevada, Sun has not yet developed the specific plans or 
identified the specific locations of additional new bank formations. 
Accordingly, the cost, timing and amount of funds required by Sun for 
development and growth opportunities cannot be precisely determined at this 
time. Although there are no specific plans for the use of a majority of the net 
proceeds, Sun is effecting this offering at this time because of favorable 
market conditions that currently exist for the public offering of stock within 
Sun's industry. If unforeseen events should occur or business conditions 
change, some or all of the net proceeds may be applied in a different manner.

- Repay all indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility ($38.8 million

to complete the purchase of technology used in operating our loyalty and rewards

any of these transactions. Pending these uses, we will invest the net proceeds
of this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.
     We are making the $2.4 million payment under a license agreement entered
into in November 1998 in connection with our acquisition of internet and
electronic commerce related assets from companies affiliated with Experian. For
additional information regarding these transactions, see ""Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations --
Acquisition Transactions"" and ""Transactions with Directors, Executive Officers
and Principal Stockholders."" Under the license agreement, the amount of the
payment is based on the present value of a specified royalty amount discounted
using a discount rate equal to the prime rate plus 2.0%. The $2.4 million
estimate set forth above assumes this payment will be made in August 1999. The
actual amount of this payment could vary depending upon the timing of the
payment and fluctuations in interest rates. Once this license payment has been
made, our rights under the license will be fully paid and we will not have any
future royalty or other financial obligations under the license.
     The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital,
to create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate our future access
to public equity markets and to provide increased visibility and credibility in
a marketplace where many of our current and potential competitors are or are
likely to become publicly held companies."

management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds.

our existing bank debt. In addition, the holders of $1.35 million of our 
subordinated exchangeable promissory notes have elected not to exchange their 
notes for shares of our common stock in connection with this offering. We have 
the right to redeem these notes for an amount equal to their outstanding 
principal plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the date of redemption. We 
will use approximately $1.35 million of the net proceeds from the offering to 
redeem all of these remaining notes prior to the end of 1999. 

After giving effect to this offering, the repayment of our existing bank debt 
and the redemption of approximately $1.35 million of our subordinated notes, we 
will have no material debt outstanding. 

Under the terms of our credit agreement, interest is payable at an annual rate 
equal to our lender's published base rate minus 0.50% or LIBOR plus a range 
from 1.5% to 2.0%, varying upon our ability to meet financial covenants. As of 
June 30, 1999, we had $16.9 million outstanding under our credit facility. Our 
credit agreement expires in July 2000. 

As of June 30, 1999, the annual interest rate was approximately 6.7%. Our 
credit agreement includes a commitment fee of 0.375% for the unused portion 
during the commitment period. During the twelve months ended June 30, 1999, we 
borrowed approximately $16.9 million under our credit agreement for the 
following purposes: 

. $9.8 million for the acquisition of two wholesale optical laboratories and 
the affiliation with 19 eye care clinics, including 19 optical retail outlets 

. $1.9 million for general working capital 

. $5.2 million to repurchase 1,188,414 shares of our Series A convertible 
preferred stock at a price of $4.38 per share

. To pursue our laser vision correction strategy through:

agreement, commitment or understanding with respect to any material 
acquisition.

investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. 

We have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock. We plan to retain all 
future earnings to finance the development and growth of our business. 
Therefore, we do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on our 
common stock. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends will be 
at our board of directors' discretion and will depend on our results of 
operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors our 
board of directors considers relevant. Our credit agreement prohibits the 
payment of dividends on our common stock."

repurchase of the 14,820,000 shares of our common stock held by Doran Machin, 
one of our co-founders. The total purchase price for Mr. Machin's shares was 
$35.0 million.

flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, facilitate our future 
access to public equity markets and increase our visibility in the marketplace.

stock and repayment of indebtedness, we cannot specify with certainty the 
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this 
offering. Pending other uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be 
invested in short-term, interest-bearing investment-grade instruments.

access to public capital markets. 

We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for corporate purposes, 
including approximately $8 million to fund an advertising and promotional
campaign to enhance awareness of our Mortgage.com brand, and approximately $2
million for technology research and development. 

In addition, we expect to use $433,300 of the net proceeds to redeem warrants to 
purchase 70,000 shares of common stock held by Superior Bank, which we are 
required to redeem under an agreement with Superior Bank. We also expect to use
the net proceeds to retire the following debt: 
o $2 million to retire 12% notes maturing February 9, 2000; 
o $8 million to retire 12% notes maturing February 22, 2001; 
o $3 million to retire 12% notes maturing April 19, 2001; and 
o $27.5 million to retire the convertible note issued to Intuit in May.
 
We used the proceeds of the debt to purchase technology, redeem warrants from 
Superior Bank and for general corporate purposes. The remaining approximately
$1 million to $9 million will be used to expand our funding sources for mortgage 
loans, for working capital and for projects which will enable us to grow our 
business.

not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to the use of the net

The Company plans to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to fund 
the final S corporation distribution to the current stockholders. This 
distribution will constitute all of the previously taxed, but undistributed, S

approximately $8.6 million. See ""Termination of S Corporation Status and Put 
Option and Dividend Policy"" and Note 3 of the Notes to the Company's 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company also intends to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering 
to repay all borrowings under the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 1999, the 
balance under the Credit Agreement was approximately $6.2 million. The Company 
will have up to $10.0 million available under the Credit Agreement following 
the offering subject to limitations based on percentages of eligible accounts 
receivable and inventories. Upon the closing of this offering, the borrowings 
under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at the bank's reference rate; 
however, the Company may periodically borrow funds under the Credit Agreement 
at LIBOR plus 1.95%. The Credit Agreement terminates on May 31, 2000. See 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and Note 5 of the Notes to the

Company intends to pursue strategic acquisitions that either expand or

option, at prime and/or LIBOR plus 2.5%. At June 30, 1999, there was no

December 15, 2004. At July 25, 1999, the weighted average interest rate with 
respect to the tranche A term loan and the tranche B term loan was 
approximately 8.1%. The actual amount repaid will be reduced by $55,800 per day,
 the sum of accrued interest and prepayment premium on the 12.5% Subordinated 
Note Due 2008 per day and accrued interest on the 11.74% Subordinated Note Due 
2008 per day, until the closing of this offering. The proceeds of our senior 
credit facilities were used to fund the acquisition of the power device 
business, to refinance our then existing senior credit facilities and to pay 
related fees and expenses. 
(2) In connection with the acquisition of the power device business from 
Samsung Electronics, Fairchild International issued to Citicorp Mezzanine 
Partners, L.P. the 12.5% Subordinated Note Due 2008 in the original principal 
amount of $50.0 million. The 12.5% Subordinated Note Due 2008 matures on 
February 1, 2008 and bears interest at an annual rate equal to 12.5%. The 
amount to be repaid includes the outstanding balance at July 25, 1999 of $51.8 
million and a prepayment premium of $0.8 million due in accordance with the 
terms of the note upon prepayment. The proceeds of the 12.5% Subordinated Note 
Due 2008 were used to fund the acquisition of the power device business, to 
refinance our then existing senior credit facilities and to pay related fees 
and expenses. The general partner of Citicorp Mezzanine Partners, L.P. is an 
affiliate of Citicorp Venture Capital Ltd. Citicorp Venture Capital owns an 
interest in Sterling Holding Company, LLC, one of our principal stockholders. 
(3) In connection with the recapitalization of Fairchild Semiconductor 
Corporation in 1997, Fairchild International issued to National Semiconductor 
the 11.74% Subordinated Note Due 2008 in the original principal amount of $77.0 
million. The 11.74% Subordinated Note Due 2008 matures on March 14, 2008 and 
bears interest at an annual rate equal to 11.74%. During Fiscal 1998, National 
Semiconductor sold the 11.74% Subordinated Note Due 2008 to a number of 
financial institutions.

$57,190,250. The principal purposes of this offering are to repay indebtedness,
 to obtain additional working capital, to create a public market for our common
 stock and to facilitate future access to public equity markets. 
We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 
- up to $23.0 million to repay indebtedness incurred in connection with Cobalt's
 acquisition of PartsVoice. Of this indebtedness, which bears interest at an 
annual rate of 8.75%, $8.0 million is due and payable on the earlier of the 
completion of this offering or August 10, 1999, and $15.0 million is due and 
payable on the earlier of the completion of this offering or January 25, 2000.
 See ""Recent Acquisition"" and Note 14 of Notes to Cobalt Financial Statements; 
- $3.5 million to repay principal and interest under our secured line of credit,
 which bears interest at prime plus 2.0%, currently 10.0%, and is due on the
 earlier of completion of this offering or December 31, 1999; and 
- approximately $2.1 million to pay accrued and unpaid dividends on our outstanding 
preferred stock. 
The remaining balance of approximately $21,685,000 will be used for general 
corporate purposes, including continued investment in services development, 
expansion of sales and marketing activities and working capital. We may, when 
the opportunity arises, use an unspecified portion of the net proceeds to acquire 
or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies. The amounts
 and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including 
the status of our product development efforts, marketing and sales activities,
 the amount of cash generated by operations and competition. 
Pending use of the net proceeds for the above purposes, we intend to invest the
 net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest bearing, investment 
grade securities."

We intend to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering as follows: 

- $18.0 million to repay a term loan with Chase Bank that bears interest at 
LIBOR plus 2.25% per year (7.31% at March 28, 1999) and matures on the earlier

simultaneously with the term loan that was used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes; and 

- $8.4 million to redeem all outstanding Plow & Hearth common stock not held by 
us and Plow & Hearth stock options. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we have not made any specific expenditure 
plans with respect to the remaining proceeds of this offering. Therefore, we 
cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds to be 
received upon completion of this offering. Accordingly, our management will 
have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. 

We currently intend to use the remaining proceeds over time: 

- to fund our marketing activities; 

- to enhance our infrastructure; 

- to enter into strategic relationships with Internet companies; 

- to expand our product offerings; and 

- for other general corporate purposes. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our working capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate future access to the 
public capital markets and to increase our visibility in the marketplace. 

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current 
business through strategic acquisitions. We may use a portion of the proceeds 
for these purposes. We are not currently a party to any contracts, letters of 
intent, commitments or agreements, and are not currently engaged in active 
negotiations, with respect to any acquisitions."

from Intuit bears an interest rate of 12.5% per annum and interest is payable

using the proceeds of the loan from Intuit for general corporate purposes 
including selling and marketing expenditures. 

In the 12 months following this offering, we intend to use approximately $26 
million of the net proceeds for expansion of our selling and marketing efforts, 
including brand promotion. A significant portion of the funds we intend to use 
for the expansion of our sales and marketing expenses will be spent on 
advertising via television, radio and direct mail. The amounts we actually 
expend for any of the foregoing purposes may vary significantly and will depend 
on a number of factors, including the amount of our future revenues. We intend 
to use the remainder of the net proceeds, over time, for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital to fund operating losses, if any, and 
capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds currently 
intended for general corporate purposes to acquire or invest in complementary

bearing securities. 

Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in the application of the net 
proceeds of this offering. Please refer to ""Risk Factors -- Our management team

.increase our capitalization and financial flexibility; 

.increase our visibility in the marketplace; 

.provide a public market for our common stock; 

.facilitate our future access to public equity markets; and 

.provide liquidity for our existing stockholders. 

We believe that our enhanced financial position will provide us with needed 
flexibility to respond to technological and market developments as well as 
other future opportunities. We also believe that our completion of this 
offering will improve our ability to attract and retain customers and 
employees. 

We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital and possible acquisitions of, and 
investments in, complementary businesses and technologies. We are not currently 
involved in negotiations with respect to, and we have no agreement or 
understanding regarding, any acquisition or investment. Accordingly, we will 
have broad discretion in the application of our net proceeds. Pending these 
uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing securities."

at the initial public offering price of $7.00 per share are estimated to be 
approximately $15.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated 
expenses. If the underwriters fully exercise the over allotment option, the net
 proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $18.8 million. We will
 not receive any of the proceeds resulting from the sale of Perfumania, Inc.'s 
1,000,000 shares of our common stock. 
The net proceeds from the offering will be used for the following purposes: 
- to fund anticipated operating losses, including sales and marketing expenses 
and payments due under strategic relationships and intercompany agreements with
 Perfumania, Inc.; 
- to enhance our online store; 
- to repay an approximately $3.5 million advance from Perfumania, Inc.; and 
- for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
perfumania.com reserves the right to vary the use of proceeds among the categories 
listed above because our ability to use the proceeds is dependent on a number of
 factors, including the degree of market acceptance of our online store, 
unexpected expenditures for further technical development, sales and marketing
 efforts and the effects of competition. 
Until perfumania.com uses the net proceeds of the offering, perfumania.com will
 invest the funds in investment grade, interest-bearing securities. 
From time to time, we also expect to evaluate possible acquisitions of or 
investments in businesses and technologies that are complementary to our business 
and technologies, and may use net proceeds from the offering for such purposes.
 While from time to time we consider potential investments or acquisitions, 
perfumania.com has no firm plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any 
such investments or acquisitions."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, we 
estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be $92.1 million. 

The principal purposes of the offering are to obtain capital to repay 
indebtedness and for working capital and general corporate purposes, establish 
a public market for our common stock and facilitate future access to public 
markets. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

- Approximately $4.2 million of the net proceeds will be used to repay our 
outstanding indebtedness to Transamerica Business Credit Corporation. The 
indebtedness to be repaid consists of $4.0 million in principal remaining on a 
bridge note bearing interest at the rate of 12.0% per annum. The bridge note is 
due upon the earlier of December 1, 1999, or the date on which we receive more 
than $10.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity 
securities. Following repayment of the bridge note, we will continue to be 
indebted to Transamerica Business Credit Corporation for a term loan with a 
principal amount of $3.5 million and a $1.0 million line of credit. 

- Approximately $1.0 million of the net proceeds will be used to redeem a $1.0 
million promissory note that we issued to the Lovett Miller 1997 Fund, a 
shareholder of GO Software, when we acquired GO Software in June 1999, if the 
Lovett Miller 1997 Fund elects not to convert the outstanding principal amount 
of the note into common stock upon the closing of this offering, which common 
stock will not be registered as part of this offering. The promissory note 
bears interest at the rate of 10.0% per annum and is due upon the effectiveness 
of the registration statement relating to this offering. 

- The remainder of these net proceeds, or approximately $74.8 million, will be 
used for working capital and general corporate purposes. We do not currently 
have a specific plan for the use of these proceeds. The amounts that we 
actually expend for working capital will vary significantly depending on a 
number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, and the amount of 
cash we generate from operations. As a result, we will retain broad discretion 
in allocating the net proceeds of this offering. See ""Risk Factors--Our 
management has broad discretion over how we use the proceeds of this offering.""
 
In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, products and technologies. From time to time, in the 
ordinary course of business, we expect to evaluate potential acquisitions of 
such businesses, products or technologies. As a result, we will have broad

We estimate that: 

. approximately $20.0 million of the net proceeds will be used to fund capital 
expenditures and operating expenses to expand our network and improve our 
technology; and 

. approximately $20.0 million of the net proceeds will be used to finance 
increased sales and marketing expenses focused primarily upon international 
expansion. 

The actual amounts may vary due to: 

. the status of our efforts to develop new services; 

. the demands placed upon our existing technology; 

. the market response to our business initiatives; and 

. our need to respond to technological and competitive developments. 

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offerings to repay 
approximately $1.7 million of debt outstanding under our line of credit. Our 
credit agreement provides both for a revolving line of credit which expires in 
December 1999 and an equipment sub-line of credit which expires in 2002, three 
years after the last draw down. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the higher of our lender's published 
prime rate plus 0.5% and the weighted average federal funds rate available to 
our lender plus 1.5%. Borrowings under the equipment sub-line of credit bear 
interest at a rate per annum equal to the higher of our lender's published 
prime rate plus 0.75% and the weighted average federal funds rate available to 
our lender plus 2.0%. Our credit agreement contains a mandatory repayment 
provision which requires us to repay the outstanding indebtedness upon 
consummation of the offerings. We have used the amounts borrowed under our 
credit agreement for working capital purposes. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary 
businesses or technologies, although we currently do not have any agreements

pools of non-performing loans and undervalued real estate consistent with our 
business strategy. Currently, we do not have any negotiations for acquisitions 
pending.

     The primary purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital,
create a public market for our common stock and facilitate future access to
public markets. Through June 30, 2001, we presently intend to use the proceeds
of this offering, together with our current cash balances, cash equivalents and
short-term investments, as follows: 56.7% for marketing and sales, 18.0% for
content and product development and the remaining 25.3% for working capital and
capital expenditures such as upgrading our computer systems architecture.
Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire technology or
businesses that are complementary to our business, we currently have no
commitments or agreements for such acquisitions and are not involved in
negotiations regarding any acquisitions. Pending use of the net proceeds for
the above purposes, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

and the sale of 835,000 shares of non-voting common stock directly to Young & 
Rubicam, assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, or 
$88.4 million in net proceeds if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full. This amount reflects deductions from the gross proceeds of 
the offering and the sale of 835,000 shares of non-voting common stock directly 
to Young & Rubicam of approximately $6.3 million, which will be retained by the 
underwriters as discounts and commissions in connection with this offering and 
as placement fees for the direct sale of shares of non-voting common stock to 
Young & Rubicam, and $9.0 million, representing our estimated expenses for this 
offering and the acquisition of our companies. We will not receive any of the 
proceeds from any sale of shares of common stock by selling stockholders upon 
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. 

We expect to use approximately $2.7 million of the proceeds from the offering 
to repay advances made to us prior to closing by Commonwealth Principals to 
fund a portion of the estimated $7.0 million of expenses for this offering, 
$2.0 million of expenses related to the acquisition of the eight companies and 
$300,000 of general and administrative expenses. These advances earn interest 
at the prime rate, which was 7.75% at June 30, 1999. 

We expect to use approximately $59.7 million of the net proceeds from the 
offering to pay the cash portion of the purchase prices payable for the 
acquisition of our companies. We will assume $7.3 million of indebtedness in 
connection with closing of the acquisition of the eight companies, which we do 
not expect to repay immediately after the closing. 

We will use the remainder of the net proceeds of approximately $23.7 million 
for general corporate purposes. A major requirement will be working capital, 
the possible payment, if we elect to pay in cash, of a portion of any 
additional amounts payable to former owners of our eight companies under the 
contingent consideration provisions of the acquisition agreements, and possible 
future acquisitions. We have no current plans or agreements to acquire any 
specific companies or businesses, other than the eight businesses we are 
acquiring simultaneously with the closing of this offering. This use of 
proceeds does not include any net proceeds to Luminant from the exercise of the 
underwriters' over-allotment option. Until we use the net proceeds of this 
offering, we intend to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest-
bearing, investment-grade securities."

financing after the closing of this offering. If we are successful in obtaining 
such financing, we currently expect that our cash needs will be satisfied for 
at least the next two years. If these funds are not sufficient to satisfy our 
needs we might need to slow our expansion and reduce our sales and marketing 
budget.

purchase of LanXtra's assets, we have complete discretion over how to use a 
significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering. You should recognize

other information on which our management bases its decision to use the 
proceeds of this offering. We cannot assure investors that our use of the net 
proceeds will not otherwise vary substantially due to unforeseen factors. Also, 
we cannot state with certainty the particular uses for the additional net 
proceeds should the over-allotment option be exercised.

principally invested in United States government securities, A-1 rated 
commercial paper with maturities of 30 days or less, short-term certificates of

The 
following two tables summarize our anticipated use of the funds, or proceeds, 
which we receive in this offering. These figures are estimates and projections 
based on information currently available. Actual numbers will vary, possibly 
quite a bit. We believe that the minimum proceeds of $5 million from the 
offering will satisfy the cash requirements for the first three years for both 
First Capital Bancshares and First Capital Bank, but we cannot be sure. Because 
this is a new enterprise, we cannot predict our future revenue or cash flow or 
whether it will be sufficient to sustain continued operation. Therefore, we do 
not know how much money we will actually spend or need. To date our expenses 
have been funded by the initial $300,000 investment of the organizers and by a 
line of credit with The Bankers Bank guaranteed by the organizers. 

USE OF FUNDS BY FIRST CAPITAL BANCSHARES 

The following table shows the anticipated use of proceeds by First Capital 
Bancshares based on the sale of the minimum number and maximum number of shares 
in this offering. The investment in First Capital Bank will be $4.5 million plus
25% of the amount by which the net proceeds of the offering exceed $4.5 million.
Net proceeds are the proceeds of the offering less our sales commissions and 
offering expenses.

estimated to be $6.0 million, giving effect to the sale by Gaiam of 1,705,000 
shares at an assumed initial public offering price of $5.00 per share, and 
after deducting the estimated underwriting discount, and offering expenses 
payable by Gaiam. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our working capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate our future access to 
the public capital markets and to increase our visibility in the retail 
marketplace. 

We intend to use approximately $750,000 of the net proceeds of the offering to 
reduce the amount outstanding under our Norwest Bank line of credit agreements. 
These line of credit agreements extend through December 31, 2001, and bear 
interest at the prime rate plus 1%. 

We have no specific plans for the remaining proceeds. They will be used for 
general corporate purposes and working capital. We may also use a portion of 
the net proceeds to acquire the minority interest in one of our subsidiaries, 
Healing Arts Publishing, LLC, or to make other acquisitions or strategic 
minority interest investments. However, we currently have no commitments or 
agreements and are not involved in negotiations with respect to acquisitions. 
Pending these uses, we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in short- 
term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. Please see ""Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."""

Preferred Stock. As of June 27, 1999 we had outstanding $229.5 million aggregate
liquidation preference of our preferred stock. Our preferred stock accrues 
dividends at a rate of 14 1/4% per year payable semi-annually. We can redeem our
preferred stock at 105% of its liquidation preference plus accumulated and 
unpaid dividends. 

Senior Notes. As of June 27, 1999 we had outstanding $93.9 million aggregate 
principal amount of our 12 1/2% notes and $75.0 million aggregate principal 
amount of our 11% notes. The 12 1/2% notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 
12 1/2% and mature on June 15, 2002. The 11% notes accrue interest at an annual 
rate of 11% and mature on March 15, 2004. On September 30, 1999, we commenced 
consent solicitations and tender offers to repurchase our 11% notes and 12 1/2% 
notes. We have received consents and tenders from the holders of 100% of our 11%
notes and 99.7% of our 12 1/2% notes. We and the trustee under each of the 
indentures have executed and delivered supplemental indentures deleting many of 
the financial covenants from the respective indentures. However, the 
supplemental indentures will not become operative until we accept and pay for 
the notes."

million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses of $1.5 million payable by us. 

We expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our personal 
communications services network, sales and marketing activities and working 
capital. We anticipate spending approximately $157.0 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1999 and approximately $250.0 million in the year 2000 on capital 
expenditures to continue our network build-out, although actual amounts 
expended may vary significantly depending upon the progress of the build-out 
and other factors. These capital expenditures will be funded through a 
combination of the proceeds of this offering, cash on hand, borrowings under 
our credit facility, committed equity investments and other sources. A portion

businesses, technologies, product lines or products. We have no current plans,

stock we are offering will be approximately $74.6 million at the initial public

discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters'
 over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds 
will be approximately $85.9 million. 

We currently intend to use approximately $38.0 million of the net proceeds to 
fund capital expenditures, consisting of the purchase of servers and other 
hardware. We also intend to use $185,000 to pay off and cancel a term loan with 
Bank One of Texas, N.A. that we entered into in July 1998 in connection with 
the purchase of equipment. Approximately $85,000 of this loan bears interest at 
6.9% per annum and matures on July 17, 2001. The remaining approximately 
$100,000 bears interest at 9.25% per annum and matures on January 17, 2002. We 
intend to use the balance of the net proceeds, or approximately $36.4 million, 
for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may use some of 
the proceeds for strategic investments and acquisitions. However, we have no 
current plans, agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisition or 
investments of this type. Our management will have significant flexibility in 
applying the net proceeds of this offering and may spend the proceeds from this

The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,

selling stockholder. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for: 

- repayment of indebtedness of approximately $4.3 million to Jaycor; and 

- working capital and other general corporate purposes, including product 
development, sales and marketing and potential acquisitions of products, 
technologies or companies. 

While we from time to time engage in preliminary discussions with respect to 
acquisitions, we are not currently a party to any agreements, understandings or 
commitments with respect to such transactions. Pending the uses described 
herein, we will invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, 
investment grade securities. 

Borrowings under our revolving loan agreement with Jaycor bear interest at a 
floating rate equal to Jaycor's incremental cost of borrowing (13.4% as of 
September 30, 1999). Advances under the agreement are due on demand, and if no 
demand is made, within ten years of the date of each advance. At September 30, 
1999, we owed Jaycor $4.3 million for advances made under this agreement. The 
amounts advanced under this agreement were used for working capital purposes 
and acquisition of fixed assets. 

Based on our current operating plan, we anticipate that the net proceeds of 
this offering, together with expected interest income and funds from 
operations, should be sufficient to finance our capital requirements for at 
least the next 12 months. This estimate is based on assumptions that could be 
negatively impacted by the matters discussed in ""Risk Factors"" and

Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."""

(1) After deducting legal, accounting and printing expenses payable by the 
Company, estimated at $105,000 in the aggregate. 
(2) If only the minimum offering is sold, only $495,000 of the net proceeds of 
the Offering will be used to fund the $605,000 cash portion of the purchase 
price. The balance will be funded from cash from operations. 
(3) Most states have adopted risk-based capital (""RBC"") rules to evaluate the 
adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and 
insurance risks. Statutory surplus and statutory operating results are 
determined according to statutes adopted by each state in which the subsidiaries
do business. Statutory surplus bears no direct relationship to equity as 
determined under generally accepted accounting principles. The RBC formula is 
designed as an early warning tool to help state regulators identify possible 
weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. 
Increases to statutory capital and surplus in excess of the ratios required by 
state insurance regulators would permit the Company to increase its sales, while
ensuring that fluctuations in premiums received and benefits paid do not have 
an adverse effect on the Company based on such regulatory guidelines. 
(4) Includes possible acquisitions of insurance companies and in force insurance
policies consistent with the Company's business strategies, as well as payment 
of general overhead and operating expenses. 

The Company intends to utilize a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering to 
repay indebtedness. At September 30, 1998, the indebtedness owed by the Company 
consisted of the following :

(1) The debt was incurred to fund capital and surplus requirements in connection
with the Company's acquisition of BCLIC in January 1998. 

(2) The debt was incurred to fund general overhead and operating expenses 
including the additional regulatory filings and actuarial fees associated with 
the Company's acquisition of BCLIC. 

(3) The debt was incurred to fund the Company's loans to medical accounts 
receivable factoring entities. 

The Company anticipates, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to its operations, that the proceeds from the Offering, together with 
projected cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet estimated 
capital expenditures through 1999. If cash flows do not develop as anticipated,
or if the Company's proposed plans or the basis for its assumptions change, the
Company may be required to obtain additional sources of capital. 

Depending on the actual number of shares sold in this Offering, the Company 
plans to use a substantial amount of the proceeds therefrom to make 
contributions of capital and surplus to its insurance subsidiaries, which will 
enable the Company to increase its sales of insurance products. Most states have
adopted risk-based capital (""RBC"") rules to evaluate the adequacy of statutory 
capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks. Statutory 
surplus and statutory operating results are determined according to statutes 
adopted by each state in which the subsidiaries do business. Statutory surplus 
bears no direct relationship to equity as determined under generally accepted 
accounting principles. The RBC formula is designed as an early warning tool to 
help state regulators identify possible weakly capitalized companies for the 
purpose of initiating regulatory action. Increases to statutory capital and 
surplus in excess of the ratios required by state insurance regulators would 
permit the Company to increase its sales, while ensuring that fluctuations in 
premiums received and benefits paid do not have an adverse effect on the Company
based on such regulatory guidelines. 

Actual allocation of net proceeds, however, will depend on the Company's success
in recruiting additional agents to sell such products. If results do not meet 
the Company's requirements, it may reallocate the proceeds among the other 
contemplated uses of proceeds. Moreover, although the Company plans to use a 
portion of the net proceeds of this Offering to fund the acquisition of Great 
Midwest, there can be no assurance that such acquisition will be effected. If 
the acquisition does not close, or if the Company has funds remaining after it 
has expended offering proceeds in accordance with the uses of proceeds described
herein, the Company may use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to acquire 
the assets of other insurance companies. Any decision to make an acquisition 
will be dependent on consideration of a variety of factors, including business 
prospects, purchase price and financial terms of the transaction. With the 
exception of the acquisition of Great Midwest, the Company has no agreements, 
understandings or arrangements with respect to any other acquisition at this 
time. See ""BUSINESS."" 

Pending application by the Company of the net proceeds of this Offering, the 
Company may invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing accounts at insured 
institutions, U.S. Government and agency obligations, certificates of deposit or
other investment grade short-term, interest-bearing securities."

PentaStar's acquisition strategy is to primarily acquire agents that provide 
small to medium-sized businesses with solutions for local access, long 
distance, wireless or Internet services for their voice and data communications 
needs. In most instances, PentaStar believes that these agents will sell only 
communications services. If an agent also sells communications equipment, and 
PentaStar is unable to acquire only the services business, PentaStar may 
acquire an equipment business that it would then seek to sell. Agent businesses 
that PentaStar would consider acquiring will likely: 

- be established agents of RBOCs or other communications service providers; 

- serve a critical mass of small to medium-sized business customers within a 
local market; 

- demonstrate a commitment to superior customer service and in-depth knowledge 
of communications services, technologies and pricing plans; and 

- be owned by an individual or group, the active members of which are 
interested in continuing management responsibilities and receiving stock as 
partial consideration for the purchase. 

PentaStar will also seek to acquire ISPs in small markets. In all instances, 
acquisitions and expenditures of funds related to acquisitions will be approved 
by a minimum of four of the five members of PentaStar's board of directors. 

Jeffrey A. Veres, who is a founder and minority shareholder of PentaStar, is 
the sole shareholder of Access and will receive the purchase price for the 
Access acquisition. Under the acquisition agreement with Mr. Veres, the cash 
amount actually payable to him will be reduced to the extent that Access has 
liabilities at the closing other than current payables and accrued expenses, 
and increased by the amount of cash held by Access at the closing. The same 
adjustment mechanism applies to the cash amount payable to the shareholders of 
ICM. No shareholders of ICM are founders, shareholders, directors or executive 
officers of PentaStar. 

As noted above, we may acquire or invest in complementary businesses or 
services and a portion of the net proceeds may be used for these acquisitions 
or investments. However, other than with respect to the pending acquisitions of 
ICM and Access, we currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements 
for any material acquisition or investment. 

Working capital will be used to pay items such as rent, office expenses, 
equipment, salaries and PentaStar's other day-to-day costs of doing business. 
It will also be used to support anticipated growth in accounts receivable as a 
result of increasing revenues. If the over-allotment option is exercised by the 
representative or if warrants are exercised, PentaStar will allocate the 
additional proceeds to acquisitions and working capital, provided that the 
amounts allocated to working capital will not exceed 15% of the net proceeds. 

The foregoing represents PentaStar's best estimate of the uses of the net 
proceeds to be received in this offering, based on current planning and 
business conditions. However, PentaStar reserves the right to change 



such uses when and if market conditions or unexpected changes in operating 
conditions or results of operations occur. PentaStar believes that the specific 
circumstances that would lead to a reallocation of proceeds will exist only if 
PentaStar is unsuccessful in identifying and acquiring, or investing in, agents 
that market communications services or in identifying and acquiring, or 
investing in, ISPs in small markets. If PentaStar is unsuccessful in acquiring 
or investing in communications services agent businesses, the proceeds 
allocated to these purposes will be reallocated to the acquisition of, or 
investment in, additional ISPs. Conversely, if PentaStar is unable to acquire 
or invest in ISPs in small markets, the proceeds allocated to acquisitions of, 
or investments in, ISPs will be reallocated to the acquisitions of, or 
investments in, communications services agent businesses. If for any reason 
PentaStar is unable to expend such proceeds in acquiring either communications 
services agent businesses or ISPs, PentaStar anticipates that such proceeds 
would be reallocated to the acquisition of, or investment in, communications 
services support businesses such as communications consulting businesses,
 telecommunications invoice consolidation and analysis firms and Web-based 
communications agents. In no event will any reallocation among acquisitions or 
investments result in an increase in amounts allocated to working capital 
exceeding 15% of the net proceeds of this offering. The amounts actually 
expended for each use may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors 
including, but not limited to, future acquisitions and the amount of cash 
generated by PentaStar's operations. PentaStar believes that its existing 
capital resources and the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to 
maintain its current and planned operations for a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of this prospectus. 
Because we have not identified specific uses for all of the net proceeds from 
this offering, management will have broad discretion over the use and 
investment of the proceeds. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, 
we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment-grade securities."

. to enhance our ability to use common stock as consideration for acquisitions 
and as a means of attracting and retaining key employees. 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the following: 

. enhancement and expansion of our network infrastructure; 

. expansion of our sales and marketing efforts, including the hiring of 
additional personnel; 

. enhancement of our application management and technical expertise; and 

. working capital and general corporate purposes. 

In addition, we may also use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for 
the acquisition of businesses or technologies that are complementary to those 
we currently possess. While we evaluate these types of opportunities from time 
to time, there are currently no agreements with respect to any specific 
acquisitions. 

We have not yet determined the actual expected expenditures and therefore 
cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each purpose set forth above. The 
amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary significantly depending upon 
a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the availability of 
construction financing, the success and timing of our hiring efforts, the 
amount of cash generated by our operations and the market response to our Web 
site and Internet application hosting and management services. Accordingly, our 
management will retain broad discretion as to the allocation of the proceeds of 
this offering. 

Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade 
securities."

common stock will be approximately $263,166,500 after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to establish a public market for 
our common stock, to increase our visibility in the marketplace, to facilitate 
future access to public capital markets, to provide liquidity to existing 
stockholders and to obtain additional working capital. 

We expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
working capital and capital expenditures, and the repayment of outstanding 
amounts under our equipment lines of credit. Other than the amounts necessary 
to repay the outstanding indebtedness, no specific amounts have been allocated 
to any particular purpose. Our lines of credit consist of: 

. a $1.0 million equipment line of credit which was converted into a term loan 
as of June 30, 1999 and is required to be repaid in 30 equal monthly 
installments commencing July 1, 1999. This line of credit bears interest at the 
bank's prime rate plus .5% (8.5% at July 31, 1999) per annum and is 
collateralized by all of our assets. At July 31, 1999, an aggregate of $967,000 
was outstanding under this line of credit; and 

. a $5.0 million equipment line of credit which will be converted into a term 
loan on January 31, 2000 and which will be required to be repaid in 36 equal 
monthly installments commencing February 1, 2000. This line of credit bears 
interest at the bank's prime rate plus .5% (8.5% at July 31, 1999) per annum 
and is collateralized by all of our assets. At July 31, 1999, an aggregate of 
$4.2 million was outstanding under this line of credit. 

Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, 
products or technologies that are complementary to our business, we have no 
specific acquisitions planned. Pending such uses, we plan to invest the net 
proceeds in investment grade, interest-bearing securities."

of 6,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering. We estimate the net 
proceeds will be approximately $101.4 million if the underwriters' over- 
allotment option is exercised in full. We estimate the expenses of this 
offering will be approximately $1.3 million. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working 
capital, to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our 
future access to public equity markets. We intend to use approximately $14.8 
million of net proceeds to repay in full all indebtedness incurred under the 
senior secured interim credit facility with Merrill Lynch & Co., one of the 
underwriters of this offering, of which $11.7 million was used to purchase 
Mobeo, approximately $0.8 million was used to pay fees and expenses related to 
the credit facility, and the remaining $2.3 million was allocated for general 
corporate purposes. For a discussion of the procedures we have used as a result 
of the fact that proceeds of the offering will be used to repay indebtedness to 
one of the underwriters, including the use of a ""qualified independent 
underwriter,"" see ""Underwriting -- NASD Regulations"" at page 69. In addition, 
we intend to use approximately $2.5 million of the net proceeds to exercise a 
warrant to increase our ownership in OpenSky from 26% to up to 33% on a fully 
diluted basis. We currently intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the 
offering for general corporate purposes, which we expect will include 
approximately $2.0 million over the next year to expand our network operations 
center. We also may use proceeds to purchase additional interests in OpenSky to 
maintain our percentage interest in OpenSky if OpenSky issues additional equity 
interests. The amount necessary for this purpose would depend on the amount and 
price of equity interests issued by OpenSky. We have not developed any specific
 plans to date with respect to use of the remaining proceeds but expect to use 
some portion of the proceeds to cover cash flow deficits. We have experienced 
operating cash flow deficits of up to $4.4 million per year, and we expect cash 
flow deficits to continue until our subscriber levels reach a level sufficient 
to cover our operating expenses, which may be as long as 18 months or more. We 
also expect our operating expenses will increase by an aggregate of 
approximately $8 million through the end of 2000 for items such as enhanced 
sales and marketing of our brand and products and enhancement of Mobeo's 
service offerings. The extent to which offering proceeds will be used to cover 
these expenses depends on the level of these and other expenses and the extent 
to which our subscriber levels increase. Finally, if we identify acquisition 
candidates that we believe advance our strategy, and proceeds of the offering 
are available taking into consideration the needs described above, we may use
 proceeds to fund acquisitions. 

Pending these uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in 
short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing instruments."

underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable. We will not receive any

this offering to our secured indebtedness outstanding under our revolving 
credit facility with BankBoston, N.A, as agent. As of June 26, 1999, our 
outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility was $18.3 million. This

annum equal to either (1) the base rate established by BankBoston, N.A. plus 
1.00% or (2) the Eurodollar rate of BankBoston, N.A. plus 2.50%, at our option

eight of our shareholders. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
stock and to raise working capital. We plan to use approximately $4.0 million 
of the net proceeds for capital equipment purchases associated with our planned 
relocation of our principal administrative, sales, marketing, support and 
research and development facilities in October 1999. We have no specific uses 
planned for the remainder of the net proceeds other than for general corporate 
purposes. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this 
offering in investment grade, interest-bearing securities. We may use a portion 
of the net proceeds to acquire additional businesses, products and technologies

not receive any portion of the net proceeds received by the selling 
stockholders from the sale of their shares upon exercise of the underwriters' 
over-allotment option. See ""Principal and Selling Stockholders."" 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our equity capital, 
create a public market for our common stock under market conditions that we
 believe are favorable, facilitate future access by us to public equity markets 
and provide us with increased visibility in our markets. As of the date of this 
prospectus, we have internally forecasted the particular uses for the net 
proceeds to be received upon completion of this offering. However, we currently 
have no formal plan for the use of the offering proceeds, nor have we sought 
the advice of or received reports from any of our professional advisors 
regarding the use of the offering proceeds. We currently estimate that the net 
proceeds of the offering will be used as follows: 

- 8% for capital expenditures (including the purchase of a new enterprise 
resource planning system; leasehold improvements; additional costs associated 
with the transition to an in-house facility of the final assembly and test 
portions of our manufacturing process, including modification to our facilities 
and test and other manufacturing equipment; and equipment and software to 
support our projected growth in personnel); 

- 7% for expansion of our marketing and distribution activities; 

- 9% for various product development initiatives; and 

- 76% for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

Notwithstanding the estimates set forth above, our management will have 
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. For 
example, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, 
products or technologies that are complementary to our current or future 
business and product lines. Although we are currently not subject to any 
agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential acquisitions, we have 
from time to time engaged in acquisition discussions with other parties. 
Pending any such uses of the proceeds of this offering, we will invest the net 
proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing 
instruments."

are approximately $96.1 million (approximately $109.9 million if the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting the 
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. 

We currently expect to use the net proceeds of the offerings for various 
purposes, including expanding our sales and marketing activities (approximately 
$8.0 million), continuing investments in technology and product development 
(approximately $1.0 million), paying fees required under a service agreement to 
establish and maintain school sites (approximately $3.3 million), as well as 
working capital and other corporate expenses (approximately $59.7 million), 
including principal payments on debt and the funding of net losses from 
operations. We expect to use approximately $2.6 million of the net proceeds for 
principal and interest payments on capital lease obligations due within the 
next twelve months. From November 1998 to June 1999, we incurred lease 
obligations of approximately $7.1 million primarily to acquire computer 
equipment at schools. The leases have a term of 36 months and bear per annum 
interest rates ranging from 9.0% to 18.6%. These amounts are preliminary 
estimates based on management's current plans, which are based on currently 
available information and market conditions, and may change as a result of 
future developments. The amounts we actually expend for such working capital 
and other purposes may also vary significantly based on the amount of our 
future revenues and the other factors described under ""Risk Factors."" In 
addition, while we intend to finance the cost of deploying our network into 
schools through third party or OEM lease finance programs, it is likely that 
not all the costs of network equipment will be covered by such finance 
programs. To this extent, we currently intend to utilize approximately $8.0 
million of the proceeds from the offering for such purpose. Our management will 
retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. 
A portion of the net proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, product lines or products. However, we

acquisition, and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect 
to any such transaction. Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this offering

commissions and estimated offering expenses. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, 
create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to 
public securities markets. 

We currently expect to use $15.7 million of the proceeds of this offering to 
repay bank debt. Had this offering closed on June 30, 1999, the amount used to 
repay bank debt would have equaled $16.0 million. This debt bears interest at 
the bank's prime interest rate plus 0.5%. Absent the prepayment, this debt is 
to be repaid in 60 monthly payments ending in January 2004. The prepayment of 
this debt will result in a 3% penalty of approximately $455,000, which will be 
paid through the application of the net proceeds of this offering. The interest 
savings resulting from the prepayment will more than offset the prepayment 
penalty. We entered into this debt to fund our acquisition in December 1998 of 
Communications Systems Division from General DataComm Inc. 

We will use the remaining proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital. We also may use a portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies or businesses.

 flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Management will 
not, however, be able to use the proceeds to purchase real estate or to 
purchase securities on stock exchanges as specified by the Ministry of Finance. 
We will be required to submit to the Reserve Bank of India and the Ministry of 
Finance quarterly statements with regard to the periodic repatriation of the 
net proceeds of this offering. Pending any use, as described above, we intend 
to invest the net proceeds in dollar or rupee denominated high quality, 
interest-bearing instruments, provided that the government of India may require 
us to repatriate the proceeds of this offering, which means converting the 
proceeds into rupees and holding them in India."

offering are estimated to be approximately $33.4 million, after deducting estimated 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
 by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, we 
estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $38.6
 million. The net proceeds we will receive from the sale of shares of common 
stock in the Disney and Hearst concurrent private placements are estimated to be
 approximately $25.0 million. In the event that the underwriters' over-allotment 
option is exercised in full, Hearst will have the right to purchase up to 
318,750 additional shares of common stock, which, if purchased, would result in
 additional net proceeds of approximately $3.2 million. If the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option in part, Hearst will have an option to 
purchase a pro rata portion of these additional shares. 
While we cannot predict with certainty how the proceeds of this offering,
the Disney and Hearst concurrent private placements and the $27.5 million in net
proceeds we received in the Torstar and Hearst private placements completed in
September 1999 will be used, we currently intend to use them approximately as
follows:
     - $5 million for expansion of our sales force
     - $20 million for marketing and distribution activities
     - $40 million for expansion of our business operations, including $15
       million for the launch of international operations, $10 million for
       increased staffing, $10 million for content production and $5 million for
       technology infrastructure
     - The remainder for working capital
     In addition, we may use a significant portion of the proceeds for the
acquisition of complementary businesses, content and technologies. Although we
are currently investigating certain opportunities to acquire complementary
businesses, we are not currently a party to any contracts or binding letters of
intent with respect to any material acquisitions, and there can be no assurance
that any of our expansion plans will be realized or, if realized, will prove
profitable for us. The allocation of the net proceeds from this offering, the
Disney and Hearst concurrent private placements and the Torstar and Hearst prior
private placements discussed above represents management's current estimates
only. Management's plans for the proceeds are subject to change due to
unforeseen opportunities and, as such, actual allocation of the net proceeds may
differ substantially from these estimates. We cannot specify with certainty the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering and the Disney and Hearst concurrent private placements and the net
proceeds we received from the Torstar and Hearst prior private placements.
Accordingly, our management team will have broad discretion in using the net
proceeds of this offering, the Disney and Hearst concurrent private placements
and the Torstar and Hearst prior private placements. We intend to invest the net
proceeds from this offering and the Disney and Hearst concurrent private
placements in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities until
they are used. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
the shares to be sold by the selling stockholder, including the sale of shares 
pursuant to the underwriters over-allotment option. 

We expect to use approximately $24.0 million for general corporate purposes and 
$6.0 million for payment of an outstanding settlement obligation with Actel 
Corporation. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire 
complementary products, technologies or businesses; however, we currently have 
no commitments or agreements and are not involved in any negotiations to do so.

from the sale of the 6,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering. We base 
this estimate on the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share and 
after the deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses totaling approximately $6.2 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for additional 
working capital and other general corporate purposes to meet the needs of our 
business. We expect increasing future losses as a result of increased marketing 
and sales, research and development and other expenditures, as well as capital 
expenditures made in the ordinary course of business. We believe we have 
sufficient cash balances prior to this offering to fund our operations for at 
least twelve months following the offering, and we have not completed our 
budgeting process for any future periods. As a result, we do not have a 
specific plan for the use of proceeds of this offering. However, we currently 
estimate that we will incur approximately $50.0 million in cash expenses during 
the next twelve months on marketing and sales, research and development, other 
operating expenses and capital expenditures, as a whole. We expect to finance 
these expenditures through our current cash balances of $36.2 million at June 
30, 1999, and expected cash receipts from sales of loyalty currencies and 
services as well as professional services revenues. If our currency related 
receipts or our professional service revenues are less than anticipated, we 
will be required to utilize a portion of the $65.8 million in proceeds from 
this offering to fund these expenses. The amounts that we actually spend for 
working capital purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of 
factors, including future revenue growth, if any, and the amount of cash we use 
in our operations. 

If we identify other companies who are strategic to our business, we may elect 
to invest in or acquire these businesses. We may use a portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire or make investments in these additional businesses, 
products or technologies or to establish joint ventures that we believe will 
complement our current or future business. We have no current agreements 
relating to any such acquisitions or investments. No estimate of these amounts 
can accurately be made, and therefore no amounts related to acquisition 
investments or joint ventures have been included in our estimate of expenses 
for the next twelve months. 

We will retain broad discretion in allocating the net proceeds of this 
offering. Pending the use of the net proceeds, we will invest them in short- 
term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

We expect to use the net proceeds for working capital and other corporate 
purposes, including advertising, capital expenditures and repayment of interest 
on outstanding debt. We have not yet determined the amount of net proceeds to 
be used specifically for each of these purposes. Accordingly, we will retain 
broad discretion in the allocation of proceeds. We may also use a portion of 
the net proceeds for strategic alliances or to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies or product lines. We have no current 
plans, agreements or commitments with respect to any alliances or acquisitions 
of this kind, and we are not currently engaged in negotiations related to any

listed above may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors, including 
the progress of our marketing programs and capital spending requirements.

of new or complementary businesses, products or technologies in an effort to 
enter into new business areas, diversify our sources of revenue and expand our

2000 on which interest accrues at a rate of 6.75% per annum and is payable 
quarterly; and 

- approximately $74 million of short-term borrowings used for working capital 
with varying maturities and an estimated weighted average interest rate of 
5.50% per annum. 

The NB Associates subordinated note is held by NB Associates, LLC, which is 
owned by the Neuberger Berman principals. The subordinated note is described 
under ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions--The NB Associates 
Subordinated Note"". 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling 
stockholders. We have agreed to assume the costs of the offerings, other than 
the underwriting discount in respect of shares sold by the selling 
stockholders, and to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the sale 
of shares by the selling stockholders."

an estimated $3.0 million for capital expenditures.

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the reorganization 
may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would 
increase if a syndicated community offering or underwritten public offering are 
used to sell shares not purchased in the subscription offering and community 
offering. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of shares to be sold in 
the offering is adjusted to reflect a change in the estimated pro forma market 
value of Rome Bancorp and Rome Savings. Payments for shares made through 
withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of 
new funds for investment by Rome Savings but will result in a reduction of 
Rome Savings' deposits and interest expense as funds are transferred from 
interest-bearing time deposits or other deposit accounts. 

Rome Bancorp may use the proceeds it retains from the offering: 

(1) to pay dividends to stockholders; 

(2) to repurchase shares of common stock issued in the offering; 

(3) to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions or other 
businesses that are related to banking; 
(4) to invest in securities; and 

(5) for general corporate purposes. 

Rome Savings may use the proceeds it receives from the offering: 

(1) to fund new loans; 

(2) to purchase investment securities; 

(3) to finance the possible establishment or acquisition of branch offices; and 

(4) for general corporate purposes.

developing, improvements in our operational and financial information systems,

net proceeds to pay the estimated tax liability related to the transfer of the 
ownership of our principal patents from our German subsidiary to a new 
subsidiary that we intend to establish in the Cayman Islands. The amount of net 
proceeds that we actually spend for these purposes will depend significantly on 
a number of factors, including our future revenues and our ability to generate 
cash from operations. We have not yet determined the amount of net proceeds to 
be used for any specific purpose. Therefore, management will have significant 
flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering.

complementary businesses, products or technologies or to obtain the right to 
use complementary technologies. We have no agreements or commitments with

EverTrust has received conditional approval from the Washington Department of 
Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to invest 
50% of the net conversion proceeds in Everett Mutual Bank. In addition, 
EverTrust will use the remainder of these funds as follows: 

o to contribute $2.3 million to Commercial Bank of Everett. 

o for general corporate purposes, which may include, for example, if the Board 
of Directors adopts a dividend policy, paying cash dividends to the 
stockholders of EverTrust and for future repurchases of common stock to the 
extent permitted under Washington law and federal regulations. 

o for additional contributions to existing and/or new subsidiaries in the form 
of debt or equity, to support future diversification or acquisition activities.
 

o to lend the employee stock ownership plan the amount necessary to purchase 2% 
of the shares sold in the conversion and issued to The EverTrust Foundation. 
The employee stock ownership plan purchases would range between 117,130 shares 
at the minimum of the offering range and 157,300 shares at the maximum of the 
offering range, including shares issued to The EverTrust Foundation. 
At the midpoint of the offering range, and including shares issued to The 
EverTrust Foundation, the employee stock ownership plan would purchase 137,800 
shares. If 8,986,250 shares are issued in the conversion, the employee stock 
ownership plan would purchase 179,725 shares. The Board of Directors of 
EverTrust has determined that the employee stock ownership plan loan will have 
a five-year term with interest payable at the prime rate as published in The 
Wall Street Journal on the closing date of the conversion. The loan will be 
repaid principally from Everett Mutual Bank's contributions to the employee 
stock ownership plan and from any dividends paid on shares of common stock held 
by the employee stock ownership plan. 

o to expand operations and services through acquiring or establishing wealth 
management and wealth transfer services or acquiring other financial 
institutions, although it has no specific plans, arrangements, agreements or 
understandings, written or oral, regarding these activities. 

Pending these uses, the net proceeds will be invested in investment securities 
with short and intermediate terms to maturity or in a deposit account at 
Everett Mutual Bank. In connection with the investment of the offering 
proceeds, management of EverTrust has indicated that it will consider all 
available capital leverage measures. 

Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale of the common stock will 
increase Everett Mutual Bank's capital and will provide it with the ability to 
expand its financial services. Everett Mutual Bank will use the net proceeds 
received from the offering as follows: 

o in the short term, to invest in short and intermediate term U.S. Government 
and agency obligations and ultimately in loan originations. 

Except as described above, neither EverTrust Financial Group, Inc. nor Everett 
Mutual Bank has specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this 
offering. Although Everett Mutual Bank's capital currently exceeds regulatory 
requirements, it is converting to a form of organization used by commercial 
banks and most other financial services companies. For a discussion of 
management's business reasons for undertaking the conversion, see ""Mutual 
Bancshares' Conversion -- Reasons for the Conversion."" 

Following the conversion, the Board of Directors will have the authority to 
adopt plans for repurchases of common stock, subject to statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Since EverTrust Financial Group, Inc. has not yet 
issued stock, there currently is insufficient information upon which an 
intention to repurchase stock could be based. The Board of Directors will 
consider many facts and circumstances in determining whether to repurchase 
stock in the future. These factors include: 

o the ability to improve EverTrust Financial Group, Inc.'s return on equity, 

o the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, 

o market and economic factors like the price at which the stock is trading in 
the market, 

o the volume of trading, and 

o the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of 
return and risk involved in the investment. 

The avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans is another factor that will be considered. The Board of Directors will 
also consider any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best 
interests of EverTrust Financial Group, Inc. and its stockholders. Before any 
stock repurchases, the Board of Directors must determine that EverTrust, 
Everett Mutual Bank and Commercial Bank of Everett will be capitalized in 
excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases and 
that capital will be adequate, taking into account, among other things, Everett 
Mutual Bank's and Commercial Bank of Everett's level of nonperforming and 
classified assets, EverTrust's, Everett Mutual Bank's and Commercial Bank of 
Everett's current and projected results of operations and asset/liability 
structure, the economic environment and tax and other regulatory 
considerations. For a discussion of the regulatory limitations applicable to 
stock repurchases, see ""Regulation -- Mutual Bancshares Dividends."""

until the conversion is completed. We presently anticipate, however, that the 
net proceeds will be between $11.63 million and $15.73 million, or up to $18.09 
million if the estimated value is increased by 15%. See ""Pro Forma Data"" and 
""The Conversion -- How We Determined Our Price and Number of Shares to be Issued
in the Stock Offering"" for the assumptions used to arrive at these amounts.

Net proceeds ................................   $11,627,000     $13,678,000      $15,730,000


 

JADE FINANCIAL will contribute approximately 50% of the gross proceeds received 
from the sale of the common stock in exchange for all of the common stock of IGA
issued in the conversion. The proceeds IGA receives in exchange for the common 
stock of IGA will become part of IGA's general funds for use in our business and
will be used to support our existing operations. We will have broad discretion 
in the allocation of these funds, but we anticipate initially investing these 
proceeds in short-term assets similar to those currently in our portfolio. 
Thereafter, we will redirect the net proceeds to the origination of loans, the 
purchase of investment and mortgage-backed securities, and the possible 
expansion of our branch system, subject to market conditions. 

Furthermore, JADE FINANCIAL also intends to lend a portion of the net proceeds 
to the employee stock ownership plan to fund the employee stock ownership plan's
purchase of 8% of the common stock. Based upon the initial purchase price of 
$8.00 per share, the dollar amount of the employee stock ownership plan loan 
would range from $986,000 to $1.33 million, or up to $1.53 million if the 
estimated value is increased by 15%. The interest rate to be charged by JADE 
FINANCIAL on the employee stock ownership plan loan will be based upon the IRS 
prescribed applicable federal rate at the time of origination. It is anticipated
that the employee stock ownership plan will repay the loan through periodic tax-
deductible contributions from IGA over a ten-year period. 

The remainder of the net proceeds will be retained by JADE FINANCIAL. We will 
have broad discretion in the allocation of these funds, but initially we expect
the remaining proceeds will be invested in short-term investments similar to 
those currently in IGA's portfolio. These funds would be available for general 
corporate purposes that may include: 

o the payment of dividends; 
o expansion of operations through acquisitions of other financial service 
organizations and diversification into other related or unrelated businesses; 
o investment purposes; and 
o contribution of additional capital into IGA when and if appropriate. 

See ""How We Are Regulated -- JADE FINANCIAL"" for a discussion of Office of 
Thrift Supervision activity restrictions. Currently, there are no specific plans
being considered for the expansion of the business of JADE FINANCIAL. 

JADE FINANCIAL also may use a portion of the proceeds to fund a restricted stock
plan equal to 4% of the number of shares sold in the conversion. This plan would
be subject to shareholder approval which cannot be sought sooner than six months
after the conversion. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock plan 
will be recognized as share awards made under the plan vest. See ""Pro Forma 
Data."" Following shareholder approval of the restricted stock plan, the plan 
will be funded either with shares purchased in the open market or with 
authorized but unissued shares. Based upon the initial purchase price of $8.00 
per share, the amount required to fund the restricted stock plan through open-
market purchases would range from $493,000 to $667,000, or up to $767,000 if the
estimated value is increased by 15%. In the event that the price of the common 
stock increases above the initial $8.00 per share purchase price following 
completion of the offering, the amount necessary to fund the restricted stock 
plan would also increase. 

Following the six-month anniversary of the completion of the conversion, to the 
extent permitted by the Office of Thrift Supervision and based upon then 
existing facts and circumstances, JADE FINANCIAL's board of directors may 
determine to repurchase shares of common stock, subject to any applicable 
statutory and regulatory requirements. Such facts and circumstances may include 
but not be limited to: 

o market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives based on the rate of return and risk involved in the investment, 
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in JADE FINANCIAL's return on 
equity; 

o the avoidance of dilution to shareholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans; and 

o any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests 
of JADE FINANCIAL. 

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of JADE FINANCIAL's 
board of directors that IGA will be capitalized in excess of all applicable 
regulatory requirements after any such repurchases."

revolving line of credit with PNC Bank. At June 30, 1999, the outstanding 
balance of this facility, including accrued interest, was $125 million. The 
revolving line of credit bears interest at PNC Bank's prime rate, which was 
7.75% at June 30, 1999. See ""Capitalization"" and ""Management's Discussion and

with the incorporation transaction, to expand our Internet business, to create 
a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the 
public markets. We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares 
of common stock we are offering will be $12.6 million. If the underwriters 
fully exercise their over-allotment option, our net proceeds will be 
approximately $14.7 million. Net proceeds is what we expect to receive after 
paying underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, based on the 
initial public offering price of $6.00 per share. 

We intend to use approximately $7.8 million of the net proceeds to pay the 
aggregate principal and interest outstanding under the S corporation 
distribution note. 

We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds to expand our Internet 
business and for general corporate and working capital purposes, including 
funding potential acquisitions of related businesses. While at times we 
evaluate potential acquisitions and anticipate continuing to make these 
evaluations, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements with 
respect to any acquisitions.

receive $4.8 million in additional net proceeds. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders in connection with 
the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. 

We currently expect to use the net proceeds primarily for working capital and 
general corporate purposes, including funding product development and expanding 
our sales and marketing organization. In addition, we may use a portion of the 
net proceeds for further development of our product lines through acquisitions 
of products, technologies and businesses, although we have no present

estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from the notes offering will be 
approximately $1.94 billion. In addition, we estimate that we will receive $725 
million in net proceeds from the concurrent investments, excluding the issuance 
of additional shares that SBC may elect to purchase. The net proceeds from the 
issuance of these additional shares will depend on whether SBC's initial 
investment is $425 million or $500 million and whether the underwriters' over-
allotment option is exercised and will range from $9.1 million (based on a $425 
million initial investment by SBC and no exercise of the underwriters' over-
allotment option) to $16.0 million (based on a $500 million initial investment 
by SBC and the exercise in full of the underwriters' over-allotment option). We 
also have available to us borrowings from a new permanent credit facility as 
well as funds from other sources, as described in the section of this 
prospectus entitled ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and capital resources -- 
Anticipated funding sources and cash uses."" 

We intend to use the net proceeds from the offerings and the concurrent 
investments, together with borrowings under our permanent credit facility and 
funds from other sources, primarily to develop and light the Williams network 
and to repay debt that was incurred to develop and light the Williams network. 
We estimate that the capital expenditures remaining to be made for this purpose 
will be approximately $2.3 billion and that the debt to be so repaid will be 
approximately $1.125 billion. We will also use these proceeds, borrowings and 
other funds to fund operating losses, for working capital and for general 
corporate purposes. For more information about our anticipated funding sources 
and our uses of these funds, see the section of this prospectus entitled 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations -- Liquidity and capital resources -- Anticipated funding sources 
and cash uses."" 

The indebtedness which we plan to repay with the proceeds of the offerings and 
the concurrent investments consists of approximately $500 million borrowed 
under our permanent credit facility and approximately $625 million borrowed 
under a new short term loan facility. We entered into these facilities on 
September 8, 1999. Borrowings under these facilities were used to repay 
borrowings under an interim credit facility. Borrowings under the interim 
credit facility were used primarily to develop and light the Williams network. 

Borrowings under the permanent credit and short term loan facilities which we 
will repay with the proceeds from the offerings bear interest at the rate of 
LIBOR plus 2.25%. The permanent credit facility consists of a revolving 
facility which extends for a six-year term and a term facility which extends 
for a seven-year term. The short term loan facility will expire December 31, 
1999. Borrowings under the interim credit facility bore interest at the rate of 
LIBOR plus .875%. See the section of this prospectus entitled ""Description of 
Indebtedness and Other Financing Arrangements."""

upon the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 

We will use $2.0 million of the net proceeds to repay a 8.69% promissory note 
and accrued interest due Western Digital. We currently expect to use the 
remaining net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. We 
currently intend to use the remaining net proceeds for working capital and 
general corporate purposes, including to continue expanding and enhancing our

yet determined our expected use of these proceeds but we currently anticipate 
that we will incur at least $12.0 million in research and development expenses 
and $14.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses over the next 
twelve months. Actual expenditures may vary substantially from these estimates.
 The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the status of our product development efforts, marketing and 
sales activities and the amount of cash generated by our operations. We may 
find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds for other 
purposes. We may also use the net proceeds for the repayment of corporate 
indebtedness which might include the early repayment of a $7.5 million 
promissory note due to Greyrock Capital on September 30, 2000. The promissory 
note bears interest at the London inter-bank offer rate, or LIBOR, plus 4.75%

We intend to use the net proceeds to fund capital expenditures and operating 
losses, for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes and 
to redeem our outstanding Series A preferred stock. We presently anticipate 
that we will spend up to $18.7 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 
2000, including the deployment of our network at approximately 80 additional 
truckstops, the installation of additional switching capacity, the purchase of 
additional prepaid phone card machines and the purchase of public Internet 
kiosks. We have not quantified a particular portion of the net proceeds to be 
used to fund operating losses. We plan to spend a significant portion of the 
net proceeds on the expansion of our sales and marketing programs and the 
development and maintenance of our portal website. In addition, we will spend a 
portion of the net proceeds on the addition of personnel to support the 
expansion of our operations that our business model contemplates, as well as 
the ongoing expenses associated with our operations, including salaries, cable 
programming, commissions payable to truckstops and the publication of our 
monthly magazine. We will also use the net proceeds to redeem our Series A 
preferred stock for $3.9 million, plus accrued dividends of $1.0 million. Funds 
managed by Patricof & Co. Ventures, Inc., which will beneficially own a total 
of approximately 15.3% of our common stock upon the completion of this 
offering, own more than 99% of our Series A preferred stock. The amounts 
actually expended for the purposes listed above, other than capital 
expenditures and the redemption of our outstanding Series A preferred stock, 
will depend on a number of factors, including the cash generated by operations, 
our ability to control our expenditures and the actual rate of expansion of our 
business. Therefore, we cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of 
the net proceeds of this offering. Our management will have significant 
flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund acquisitions or 
investments. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate 
possible acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, products and 
technologies that are complementary to ours. We currently have no arrangements, 
agreements or understandings, and are not engaged in active negotiations for 
any such acquisitions or investments.

class A common stock in this offering and 1,950,000 shares in the concurrent 
offering to AT&T Wireless will be approximately $206.6 million after deducting 
the estimated underwriting discounts of this offering and estimated offering

$95 million in the fourth quarter of 1999 and approximately $185 million in the 
year 2000 on capital expenditures to continue our network construction,

progress of the construction and other factors. These capital expenditures are 
expected to be funded through a combination of the proceeds of this offering

than the pending acquisitions of TeleCorp LMDS and additional airwaves in 
Louisiana, we have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such 
acquisition. However, we continually evaluate opportunities and enter into 
discussions regarding possible acquisitions of licenses and properties that 
will complement or extend our existing operations. We may incur substantial 
additional debt to finance any future acquisitions. We do not currently expect 
that we would acquire licenses in any new market unless we are able to extend 
the AT&T agreements to cover our operations in that market.

estimated offering expenses. 

We intend to use approximately $23.3 million of the proceeds of the offering 
for repayment of indebtedness. We plan to use the remainder of the proceeds for 
general corporate purposes, including working capital. We may also use some of 
the proceeds to acquire other complementary businesses, although we have no

net proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-term, investment grade,

The indebtedness to be repaid with the proceeds of this offering consists of 
two term loans, with principal balances of $11.0 million and $12.0 million at 
October 2, 1999, and any outstanding borrowings under our $5.0 million 
revolving credit facility. As of October 2, 1999, total borrowings of $317,000 
were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The term loans and 
revolving credit facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our 
assets. We pay quarterly interest on the term loan that has an $11.0 million 
principal balance at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.75%. 
We pay quarterly interest on the other term loan at LIBOR plus 3.00%. As of 
October 2, 1999, LIBOR equaled 5.40% and the interest rates on our term loans 
were 8.15% and 8.40%, respectively. As of October 2, 1999, the interest rate on 
our revolving credit facility was based on the prime rate plus 1.25%, which 
equalled 
9.50%. Both of the term loans and the revolving credit facility mature on 
December 31, 2003. The terms of our indebtedness require us to maintain 
specified financial ratios and observe additional restrictive covenants. As of 
October 2, 1999, we were in compliance with these ratios and covenants."

Purchase of terminals. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds for the 
purchase of ID-Check terminals, which we expect to be delivered by the end of 
the second quarter of 2000. 

Repayment of indebtedness. We intend to repay $1,200,000 principal amount of 27 
secured promissory notes bearing interest at the annual rate of 10%, plus 
approximately $25,000 of accrued interest, which will be due on the promissory 
notes. The promissory notes, the terms of which are identical except for the 
principal amounts, mature on the earlier of July 31, 2000 or the closing of 
this initial public offering. The proceeds from the sale of these promissory 
notes were used for the purchase of ID-Check terminals and for working capital 
and general corporate purposes. 

Product development. We intend to continue to enhance the performance and 
increase the capability of our ID-Check terminal. We also intend to develop 
additional applications for our technology. Costs of product development 
include the hiring of additional employees, construction of prototypes and 
testing. 

Sales and marketing. We expect to hire sales and marketing personnel to 
establish a marketing program. We also will be preparing additional marketing 
materials and further developing our website. 

Working capital and general corporate purposes. We may use a portion of the 
proceeds allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes to pay 
trade payables incurred from time to time and the salaries of our employees, if 
cash flow from operations is insufficient for these purposes. 

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will 
realize additional net proceeds of $992,813, all of which will be allocated to 
working capital and general corporate purposes. 

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of this offering based upon the current status of our business. This 
estimate is based on certain assumptions, including the development of our 
business in the way we anticipate. If any of our assumptions prove incorrect, 
we may find it necessary to reallocate a portion of the proceeds within the 
above-described categories or use portions of the proceeds for other purposes. 
Our estimates may prove to be inaccurate, new programs or activities may be 
undertaken which will require considerable additional expenditures or 
unforeseen expenses may occur. 

Based upon our current plans and assumptions relating to our business plan, we 
believe the net proceeds of this offering, combined with other anticipated 
available cash resources, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for 
at least twelve months following the closing of this offering. If our plans 
change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to seek 
additional financing sooner than currently anticipated or curtail our 
operations. We cannot assure you that the proceeds of this offering will be 
sufficient to fund our proposed growth or that additional financing will be 
available if needed. 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest 
bearing investments."

portion of the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding term loans. 

We currently expect that for the balance of 1999 and 2000, capital expenditures 
will total approximately $118.0 million, including expenditures for upgrades 
and replacements of switch and transmission capacity in our local exchange 
operations, expansion of digital wireless capacity in our cellular operations 
and the introduction of DSL services. 

We are actively pursuing selected regional acquisitions in Alaska. There are 19 
local exchange carriers remaining in Alaska with an aggregate of approximately

stock offered by Finisar in this offering to be approximately $142.8 million, 
or approximately $150.9 million if the underwriters exercise their over-
allotment option in full, based on an initial public offering price of $19.00 
per share and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses. We will not receive any of the proceeds from any shares that may be 
sold by the selling stockholders upon exercise of the underwriters' over-
allotment option. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering: 

- to repay outstanding indebtedness of approximately $11.0 million under our 
bank credit facility; 

- to redeem all outstanding shares of our redeemable preferred stock for 
$2,640,260; and 

- for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working 
capital. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use 
complementary technologies. However, we have no current commitments or
 agreements with respect to any of these types of acquisitions or investments. 
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.

complementary to our current business, through mergers, acquisitions, joint 
ventures or otherwise. However, we have no specific agreements or commitments

We have also elected to pursue our initial public offering at this time for the 
following secondary reasons: 

. to facilitate future access by us to the public equity markets; 

. to enhance our ability to use our common stock as a means of attracting, 
retaining and motivating employees, senior managers and others; and 

. to provide liquidity to our shareholders. 

As indicated, we have not yet determined the actual expected expenditures, and 
thus cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each purpose discussed above. 
The amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary significantly depending 
on a number of factors, including such factors as the amount, if any, of cash 
generated by our operations and the market response to our service offerings. 
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of 
the net proceeds. You will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, 
financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use the 
proceeds. Pending such uses, the net proceeds will be primarily invested in 
short-term, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or 
guaranteed obligations of the United States. See ""Risk Factors-- Risks Related

In July 1997, we established a term loan in the amount of $2.0 million, the 
proceeds of which were contributed to the capital of Pelican National. The term 
loan is payable on demand and the interest rate is the weighted average Federal 
Funds Rate plus 2.75%, which resulted in an effective rate of 7.60% at December 
31, 1998 and 8.30% at December 31, 1997. Depending upon market conditions and 
other factors, we may determine upon the completion of this offering to use the 
$2.0 million to repay some or all of the term loan, or to retain the $2.0 
million at the holding company level for possible future contribution to the 
regulatory capital of Pelican National or for possible acquisitions. In the 
short term, we expect to invest the $2.0 million in deposits of Pelican 
National and other short-term liquid investments. 

We also have a subordinated note payable with a balance of $1.2 million. The 
note requires monthly interest payments of 4.50% per annum over the prime 
interest rate, which resulted in an effective rate of 12.25% at December 31, 
1998 and 13.00% at December 31, 1997. The note matures in December 1999. We 
intend to use $1.2 million of the net proceeds of this offering to repay this 
note. 

Also as shown above, we intend to contribute $3.0 million of net proceeds to 
the regulatory capital of Pelican National. Pending their investment into 
longer term assets, the proceeds are expected to be used by Pelican National to
 make investments in mortgages or other loans, U.S. Government and federal 
agency securities, federal funds, certificates of deposit, mortgage-back 
securities, and other investments. The proceeds are expected to strengthen 
Pelican National's regulatory capital position to provide an additional source 
for funding longer term assets. The amount of proceeds contributed to Pelican 
National will be evaluated as part of Pelican National's overall asset/
liability mix and may be used to support expansion through the acquisition or 
establishment of new bank branches. Other than the signing of a lease on a new 
branch in Fort Myers, Florida in May 1999, we currently do not have any 
arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding any similar opportunities 
or transactions. The proceeds from this offering are not expected to be used to 
fund the new branch. 
We have decided to conduct our initial public offering at this time because we 
believe that the current environment in the equity capital markets can provide 
us funds at a lower cost than other forms of financing. The elimination of a 
portion of our debt and the increase in the capital of Pelican National and 
Washtenaw will improve our capital structure and provide us greater flexibility 
for the future. Because the decision of how to use the net proceeds of the 
offering will be made upon completion of the offering, after considering all 
relevant information, we retain broad discretion as to the allocation of the
 net proceeds."

Charter Communications, Inc. will represent an approximate 31% equity interest

Charter Communications Holding Company will use the cash proceeds from the sale 
of the membership units to Charter Communications, Inc., together with the 
proceeds from the $750 million equity purchase described above, to pay a 
portion of the cash purchase prices of the pending acquisitions. These sources,

million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering 
expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the 
selling shareholders. 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering received by us as 
follows: 

. approximately $33.5 million to repay principal and accrued interest owed to 
InterCept; 

. approximately $3.1 million to repay working capital advances and accrued 
interest owed to InterCept; 

. approximately $6.0 million to expand our sales and marketing efforts over the 
next 12 months; 

. approximately $4.0 million to continue our product development over the next 
12 months; and 

. approximately $3.1 million for working capital and other general corporate 
purposes, including potential acquisitions. 

The loans we intend to repay bear interest at a rate equal to the prime rate 
plus 2% per year. As of October 15, 1999, this rate was 10.25%. These loans 
mature on the earlier of (1) the completion of our initial public offering or 
(2) August and September 2001. The borrowings were used to fund our 
acquisitions of SBS, Dyad and Call Me Bill. 

From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate the 
acquisition of businesses and technologies that complement our business, and we 
may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to fund these 
acquisitions. Currently, however, we do not have any understandings, 
commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions, and we may not be 
able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete any acquisition. 

The amount of funds that we actually use for these purposes, other than debt 
repayment, will depend on many factors, including revisions to our business 
plan, material changes in our revenue or expenses, and other factors described 
under ""Risk Factors."" Accordingly, our management will have significant 
discretion over the use and investment of the net proceeds from the offering.

will be approximately $350.5 million, based on the initial public offering 
price of $15.00 per share and after deducting the underwriters' discounts and 
commissions and expenses payable by us estimated at $2.0 million. We expect to 
use the net proceeds from this offering principally to fund the construction of 
and equipment for distribution centers in other geographic markets at an 
estimated cost of $25.0 million to $35.0 million per distribution center. This 
estimated cost is based on our experience to date and efficiencies we expect to 
result from our relationship with Bechtel. Our contract with Bechtel 
Corporation contemplates the construction of up to 26 additional distribution 
centers over the next three years. The cost of constructing and equipping 26 
additional distribution centers is currently estimated at from $650 million to 
over $900 million. At June 30, 1999, our cash and cash equivalents were 
approximately $647.2 million after including the net proceeds from the sale of 
our Series D-2 preferred stock in July and August 1999 and the expected net 
proceeds from the shares sold in this offering. Thus, the completion of 26 
additional distribution centers would require us to generate cash flow from 
operations or to sell additional debt or equity securities or obtain a line of 
credit. If such funds are not available when needed or if the cost of these 
distribution centers exceeds our current estimates, we could also be forced to 
curtail our expansion plans. The number and timing of opening of new 
distribution centers are subject to considerable uncertainty due to a number of 
factors, including the following: 

- the availability of appropriate and affordable sites that can accommodate our 
distribution centers; 

- the actual cost of constructing and equipping our distribution centers; 

- our ability to successfully and cost-effectively hire and train qualified 
employees to operate new distribution centers; 

- our ability to develop relationships with local and regional distributors, 
vendors and other product providers; 

- acceptance of our product and service offerings; and 

- competition. 

We also expect to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
working capital and funding of our expected operating losses. We may use a 
portion of the net proceeds to pursue possible acquisitions of complementary 
businesses, technologies or products; however, we have no present 
understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any such 
transactions, and we have not identified the nature of any such businesses, 
technologies or products. Pending use of such net proceeds for the above 
purposes, we intend to invest such funds in short-term interest-bearing

million and the underwriting discount payable by Tickets.com. We will not 
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling 
stockholder. 

We intend to use at least $19.1 million of the net proceeds of this offering to 
repay outstanding current and long-term senior and subordinated debt, including 
$18.2 million of long-term senior and subordinated debt. This debt must be paid 
between October 1999 and October 2004 or upon the closing of our initial public 
offering, if earlier, and bears interest at rates ranging from 9.25% to 12.0%. 
We have not yet determined our actual expected use of the remainder of these 
proceeds, but we currently anticipate that we will use between $23.0 and $26.0 
million over the next twelve months for sales and marketing expenses associated 
with our advertising campaigns, brand name promotions and other marketing 
efforts. Additionally, we estimate using between $9.0 and $11.0 million over 
the next twelve months for technology development expenses for product 
development, the development of our technology infrastructure, web site content 
and online capabilities. Also, we expect to use between $10.0 and $13.0 million 
over the next twelve months for general and administrative expenses, 
principally for general corporate purposes and working capital to fund 
anticipated net operating losses. We also currently estimate that we will incur 
approximately $6.0 million of capital expenditures over the next twelve months. 
Our actual expenditures may vary substantially from these estimates. The 
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, 
including the status of our technology development efforts, sales and marketing 
activities, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations and 
competition. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the 
proceeds for other purposes, and our management will have broad discretion in 
the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. 

A portion of the net proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, product lines or products. On June 21, 
1999 we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger with Lasergate. 
Under the terms of the merger we will acquire all of the outstanding common 
shares of Lasergate for approximately $1.5 million. Completion of the merger is 
subject to approval of the shareholders of Lasergate and other conditions of 
closing. The Lasergate transaction is described in more detail in ""Risk Factors

Costs, Losses and Liabilities That Could Adversely Affect Our Results of 
Operations."" Also, if our underwriters decide not to allow the selling 
stockholder to register and sell up to 444,444 of her shares of common stock in 
this offering, the selling stockholder may exercise her right to cause us to 
purchase up to 444,444 shares from the selling stockholder at the initial 
public offering price. A portion of the proceeds would be used to effect this 
purchase. In addition, we have proposed to pay $3.0 million to a major 
ticketing services client as an exclusivity fee in connection with a new long-
term ticketing services agreement. Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this 
offering will be invested in short term, interest-bearing, investment-grade 
securities."

The precise allocation of funds among these uses will depend on future 
commercial, technological, regulatory and other developments in or affecting

amounts under our credit arrangements with Comdisco, Inc:

equipment, furniture and fixtures.

cannot be determined until the conversion is completed, we presently anticipate 
that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock will be 
between $36.8 million and $50.3 million and up to $58.0 million assuming an 
increase in the estimated value of the common stock sold in the conversion by 
15%. See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""Mutual Federal's Conversion - How We Determined
 Our Price and the Number of Shares to be Issued in the Stock Offering"" as to 
the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. 

We intend to use the net proceeds received from the stock offering, assuming 
completion of the offering at the maximum of the estimated offering range, as 
follows: 


$18,749,000     Retained by MFS Financial and initially placed in
                short-term investments for general corporate purposes

  4,306,000     Employee stock ownership plan loan

  2,070,000     Cash contribution to The Mutual Federal Savings Bank
                Charitable Foundation, Inc.

 25,125,000     Used to buy the stock of Mutual Federal

$50,250,000     Net proceeds from stock offering


 

MFS Financial will retain 50% of the net conversion proceeds, from which it 
will fund the cash portion of the contribution to the foundation and the loan 
to be made to the employee stock ownership plan, and will purchase all of the 
capital stock of Mutual Federal to be issued in the conversion in exchange for 
the remaining conversion proceeds. MFS Financial intends to use a portion of 
the net proceeds to make a loan directly to the employee stock ownership plan 
to enable the employee stock ownership plan to purchase up to 8.0% of the 
shares of common stock issued in the conversion, including the shares 
contributed to the foundation. Based upon the issuance of 3,825,000 shares of 
common stock and 5,175,000 shares of common stock at the minimum and maximum of 
the estimated offering range, respectively, the loan to the employee stock 
ownership plan would be $3.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively. See 
""Management -Benefits - Employee Stock Ownership Plan."" The remaining net 
proceeds retained by MFS Financial initially may be used to invest in U.S. 
Government and federal agency securities of various maturities, mortgage-backed 
or other securities, deposits in either Mutual Federal or other financial 
institutions, or a combination thereof. The net proceeds may ultimately be used 
to: 

o support Mutual Federal's lending activities; 

o repay borrowings in the ordinary course of business; or 

o support the future expansion of operations through the establishment of 
additional banking offices or other customer facilities or through acquisitions 
of other financial institutions or branch offices, although no such acquisition 
transactions are specifically being considered at this time. 
The net proceeds from the conversion may also be used for other business and 
investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special cash 
dividends, possible repurchases of the common stock or returns of capital. MFS 
Financial and Mutual Federal have committed however, not to take any action to 
further the payment of any return of capital on the common stock during the 
one-year period subsequent to completion of the conversion. Management of MFS 
Financial may consider expanding or diversifying its activities, as such 
opportunities become available. 

Following the six-month anniversary of the completion of the conversion, to the 
extent permitted by the Office of Thrift Supervision and based upon then 
existing facts and circumstances, MFS Financial's board of directors may 
determine to repurchase shares of common stock, subject to any applicable 
statutory and regulatory requirements. Such facts and circumstances may include 
but not be limited to: 

o market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the 
investment, the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of 
the remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in MFS Financial's return
 on equity; 

o the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans; and 

o any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests 
of MFS Financial and its stockholders. 

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of MFS Financial's 
board of directors that Mutual Federal will be capitalized in excess of all 
applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. 

The portion of the net proceeds used by MFS Financial to purchase the capital 
stock of Mutual Federal will be added to Mutual Federal's general funds to be 
used for general corporate purposes, including increased lending activities. 
While the amount of net proceeds received by Mutual Federal will further 
strengthen Mutual Federal's capital position, which already substantially 
exceeds all regulatory requirements, Mutual Federal is not converting to stock 
form primarily to raise capital. After the conversion, based upon the maximum 
of the estimated offering range, Mutual Federal's tangible capital ratio will 
be approximately 12.28%. As a result, Mutual Federal will continue to be a well-
capitalized institution. 

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion may be more 
or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of 
shares to be issued in the conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in the 
estimated pro forma market value of Mutual Federal. Payments for shares made 
through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at Mutual Federal will not 
result in the receipt of new funds for investment by Mutual Federal but will 
result in a reduction of Mutual Federal's interest expense and liabilities as

 Development and expansion of our Web site includes gathering necessary 
information regarding publishers for installation onto our Web site and 
providing software to additional newspapers allowing them to publish data 
received from our Web site without data reentry. 

Product development and site maintenance includes providing technical support 
and creating and updating editorial content. 

Debt retirement consists of indebtedness of: 

- $739,032 payable in monthly installments of $8,333.33 through March 2013 
which includes interest at 10% per annum for the purchase of technology which 
we formerly licensed from the seller; and 

- $850,000 for a loan from a small business investment company, the proceeds of 
which were used as working capital. The loan is payable on or before July 12, 
2004 and bears annual interest at the rate of 14% per annum. 

Both items of indebtedness must be paid on completion of this offering. 

In October 1999, we received $1,600,000 from Paulson Investment Company, Inc. 
and Paulson Capital Corporation as discussed in ""Recent Developments."" This sum 
increased our working capital and may be used for general corporate purposes 
and to supplement the proceeds of this offering in expanding our Web site. 

The amounts we actually expend for general corporate purposes may vary 
significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of 
our future revenues and the other factors described under ""Risk Factors."" Our 
management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds 
of this offering. A portion of the net proceeds may also be used for general 
corporate purposes or for strategic partnerships or to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies or product lines. We have no current 
agreements or commitments and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations 
with respect to any acquisitions. Pending these uses, the net proceeds of this 
offering will be invested in short term, interest-bearing, investment grade 
securities."

acquisitions and as a means of attracting and retaining key employees.

provide additional new product or service offerings, additional industry 
expertise, a broader client base or an expanded geographic presence, and a 
portion of the net proceeds from this offering may be used for such

for our working capital requirements and, after the initial public offering, to
 reduce the interest rate on our outstanding intercompany indebtedness to its

underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will receive net 
proceeds of $63.9 million after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting 
discounts and commissions. 

In the 12 months following this offering, we intend to use approximately $25 
million of the net proceeds from this offering for expansion of our selling and 
marketing efforts, including brand promotion. The amounts we actually expend 
for that purpose may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, 
including consumer response to our marketing efforts and the amount of our 
future revenues. In addition, we intend to repay the $1.3 million, non-interest 
bearing loan from Mr. Thomas L. Blair, and the $2.4 million of borrowings under 
the line of credit, which is guaranteed by United Payors & United Providers. 

We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds, over time, for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital to fund operating losses and 
capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds currently 
intended for general corporate purposes to acquire or invest in complementary 
businesses, technologies, products or services, although no specific 
acquisitions or investments are planned and no portion of the net proceeds has 
to date been allocated for any such acquisition or investment. Pending such 
uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in investment- 
grade, interest-bearing securities. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion 
in the application of the net proceeds of this offering."

amount of cash that we actually expend for working capital purposes will vary 
significantly depending on a number of factors, including future revenue 
growth, if any, and the amount of cash, if any, we generate from operations. We 
have not yet prepared a quantified business plan. Thus, we have not yet 
specified the allocation of net proceeds and our existing cash balances among 
the foregoing purposes. Thus, management will have significant discretion in 
applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, 
we will invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment grade, interest- 
bearing securities."

Marketing and advertising. We intend to increase the visibility and awareness 
of E-Cruiter and our services through an integrated program of marketing 
initiatives, including tradeshow participation, seminars, direct mail, industry 
analyst meetings and media interviews. We also intend to develop our web site 
to provide potential clients with information about E-Cruiter and our services. 
In addition, we intend to increase significantly our advertising efforts, 
primarily through radio, print and Internet advertising. 

Technology development and acquisition. We intend to expand our software 
development capability by adding new personnel to continue to enhance our 
services. In addition, we have identified WorkLife Solutions, Inc. as a company 
with distribution arrangements and technology complementary to our business. 
WorkLife is focused on developing and operating career services of major 
Internet portals such as AltaVista.com. We are currently developing services 
jointly with WorkLife to offer on AltaVista.com's Career Channel. We also 
acquired an option from Paul Champagne, our largest shareholder, to acquire his 
interest and related rights in WorkLife for the greater of the fair market 
value of his interest and related rights in WorkLife and US $1,000,000, at any 
time until April 13, 2000, subject to extension until October 13, 2000. As of 
the date of this prospectus, we have no plans, agreements, commitments, 
understandings or arrangements with respect to any acquisitions, other than the 
potential investment in WorkLife. 

Sales. We intend to expand our sales efforts, including hiring additional sales 
personnel in Canadian markets and building a sales force in key U.S. markets. 
We plan to add up to 20 additional sales personnel for our direct sales and for 
support for our indirect sales in Canada and the United States. 

Repayment of indebtedness. We intend to repay (i) the principal of, and related 
interest on, a $1,300,000 (US $882,852) loan which we obtained from Paul 
Champagne, our largest shareholder, in September 1999, and (ii) borrowings 
under a line of credit in the amount of up to $190,000 (US $129,032). The loan 
from Mr. Champagne bears interest at the Canadian prime lending rate, which was 
6.25% per year on October 26, 1999, plus an additional 3% per year and is due 
on the earlier of March 2000 and the closing of this offering. The borrowings 
under the line of credit bear interest at the Canadian prime lending rate,
 which was 6.25% on October 26, 1999, plus an additional 2.5% per year. We used 
the proceeds of the loan from Mr. Champagne for working capital and general 
corporate purposes and are using the proceeds of the borrowings under the line 
of credit for the same purposes. 

Client support and network infrastructure. In order to expand and improve our 
client support and to provide around the clock services to our clients, we 
intend to increase the number of client support and network operations 
personnel and expand our network infrastructure. Investments in our 
infrastructure include upgrades to our network operations center, network 
servers and related software and computers. 

Working capital and general corporate purposes. We may use a portion of the 
proceeds allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes to pay a 
portion of trade payables incurred from time to time and the salaries of our 
officers, if cash flow from operations is insufficient for these purposes. 

Over-allotment option. If the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option 
in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses of this 
offering, we will realize additional net proceeds of US $1,944,075 all of which 
will be allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes. 
The foregoing description represents our best estimate of the allocation of the 
net proceeds of this offering based upon the current status of our business. We 
based this estimate on assumptions, which include: a continued expansion of our 
client base and corresponding increases in revenue; completion of our proposed 
new services release; and the introduction of our new services without 
unanticipated delays or costs. If any of these factors changes, we may find it 
necessary to reallocate a portion of the proceeds within the above-described 
categories or use portions of the proceeds for other purposes. Our estimates 
may prove to be inaccurate, new programs or activities may be undertaken which 
will require considerable additional expenditures, or unforeseen expenses may 
occur. 

Based upon our current plans and assumptions relating to our business plan, we 
anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering will satisfy our capital 
requirements for at least 12 months following the closing of this offering. If 
our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to seek 
additional financing sooner than currently anticipated or curtail our 
operations. We cannot assure you that the proceeds of this offering will be 
sufficient to fund our proposed expansion or that additional financing will 
become available if needed. 

We intend to invest proceeds not immediately required for the purposes 
described above principally in Canadian or United States government securities, 
short term certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term 
interest-bearing investments."

approximately $86.1 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and 
general corporate purposes, including expansion of our Internet panel and 
development of new technologies, products and services. We believe 
opportunities may exist to expand our current business through acquisitions or 
investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, 
and we may utilize a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes. We are not 
currently a party to any contracts or letters of intent with respect to any 
acquisitions or investments. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot 
identify specific uses of the net proceeds. Accordingly, our management will

proceeds for general corporate purposes. The actual amounts expended for 
specific purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors,

target markets and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, technologies or products that are 
complementary to our business. However, we have no present plans or commitments 
and are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to such 
transactions.

equal to Daisytek's cost of funds (6.5% as of September 30, 1999), the proceeds
