of common stock that we are selling in this offering will be $140.3 million,
based on the initial public offering price of $12.50 per share, and after
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive net proceeds of
$162.1 million.

        We currently anticipate that we will use approximately $122.4 million of
the net proceeds to prepay the entire principal, interest and prepayment penalty
due on our $120.0 million senior second lien term loan and approximately
$17.9 million to prepay a portion of the $379.0 million currently outstanding
under our senior secured term loan B. We entered into the $120.0 million senior
second lien term loan and the $380.0 million senior secured term loan B on
March 17, 2004. The principal of the senior second lien term loan is due in a
single installment on March 17, 2012, and bears interest either at a LIBOR rate
plus 5% or a floating base rate determined by the lender plus 4%. The principal
of the senior secured term loan B is subject to scheduled quarterly amortization
of 0.25% of the initial principal amount, payable in arrears, for the first
6.75 years, and 93.25% of the initial principal in the final quarter of the
seventh year, and bears interest either at a LIBOR rate plus a variable interest
rate margin or a floating base rate determined by the lender plus a variable
interest rate margin.

        We used the proceeds of these loans to refinance substantially all of
our existing debt and pay accrued interest in the aggregate amount of
$219.0 million, to pay fees and expenses of $11.0 million in connection with the
new credit facilities and to make a cash payment in the aggregate amount of
$270.0 million of which $258.4 million was distributed to our preferred and
common stockholders, pro rata in accordance with their stockholdings, and
$11.6 million was paid to management in the form of one-time bonuses. The
purpose of the bonuses was to treat management equitably with other
stockholders, by providing for a cash distribution to each individual based on
the aggregate in-the-money value of his or her vested options."

of offering proceeds by us, assuming (i) that all of the shares offered by this
prospectus are sold and (ii) that the underwriters also exercise their
over-allotment option in full. We estimate that approximately 91.85% of the
gross offering proceeds will be available for the purchase of mortgage loans and
mortgage-backed securities, and none of the gross offering proceeds will be paid
by us directly or reimbursed to our affiliates for organizational or offering
expenses. While the estimated use of proceeds set forth in the table below is
believed to be reasonable, this table should be viewed only as an estimate of
the use of proceeds that may be achieved.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering:

   º –> to fund and retain in our portfolio high quality single-family ARM and
     hybrid ARM loans that meet our investment criteria. From time to time, we
     may purchase primarily high quality mortgage-backed securities in order to
     balance our portfolio, particularly in the first year of our operations
     while we focus on expanding our portfolio of originated and retained ARM
     and hybrid ARM loans; and

   º –> for general corporate purposes, including working capital, and for
     potential future acquisitions of other mortgage banking businesses
     (although no acquisitions are specifically being considered at this time).

We may need a significant amount of time to invest fully the available net
proceeds of this offering in our intended investments and to implement fully our
leveraging strategy to increase the total amount of our investments to our
desired level. Initially, we will invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing,
short-term, investment grade securities which are consistent with our intention
to qualify as a REIT. We will not leverage our temporary investment in these
securities. We expect these investments to provide a lower net return than we
hope to achieve from our long-term intended use of the proceeds of this
offering."

this offering will be approximately $32.0 million, and $37.0 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based upon the
initial public offering price of $8.00 per share and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital
and to create a public market for our common stock.

       We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including working capital, research and development expenses, general
and administrative expenses and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion
of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in, or acquisitions of,
complementary businesses, products or technologies or in establishing joint
ventures. We have no current agreements or commitments with respect to any
investment, acquisition or joint venture, and we currently are not engaged in
negotiations with respect to any investment, acquisition or joint venture.

       Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. Pending these uses,

We estimate that we will use approximately $58 million of the net proceeds of
this offering to continue the development of our Technosphere Insulin System,
including the continuation of our clinical trial program, and to develop
additional applications for our proprietary Technosphere formulation technology.
We expect, with these proceeds, to complete Phase II trials on Technosphere
Insulin and initiate a Phase III clinical trial. Additionally, our efforts with
respect to our Technosphere Insulin System will include expansion of our
manufacturing operations and quality systems.

We estimate that we will use approximately $12 million of the net proceeds of
this offering to expand our other product development programs, specifically
developing therapies for the treatment of solid-tumor cancers and a variety of
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We expect to begin preclinical safety
tests for a cancer product candidate later this year, with the goal of
commencing clinical trials in 2005.

We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds of this offering to fund
operations, to provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes,
which may include in-licensing or acquiring additional technologies. We have no
current plans, agreements or commitments with respect to any future acquisitions
or in-licensing, and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations with
respect to any transactions of that nature.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering.
Pending these uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States. The goal with
respect to the investment of these net proceeds is capital preservation and
liquidity so that funds are readily available to fund our research and
development operations. On December 12, 2003, our board of directors adopted our
written investment policy. The investment policy imposes restrictions on our
investments in order to ensure that we preserve our principal and maintain our
liquidity. Any investment of the net proceeds from this offering will be made in
accordance with the terms of our investment policy."

underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses, including a

incurred on our behalf and an additional $800,000 to reimburse SL Green for a
consulting fee of $400,000 to be paid by SL Green to each of Messrs. Foley and

stock by us, will be approximately $199.6 million. No underwriting discounts or
commissions are payable in connection with the sale of shares to SL Green.

        We intend to use substantially all the net proceeds of this offering to
make investments in commercial real estate-related loans and securities and for
general corporate purposes, including financing and operating expenses and other
expenses of the Company. Until appropriate investments can be identified, we
intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering temporarily in readily
marketable interest-bearing securities consistent with our intention to qualify
as a REIT, or we may hold cash."

$18,360,000 or $21,114,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund maintained by
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as
determined by our board of directors at that time.

 

The payment to Sand Hill Security, LLC, an affiliate of our directors and
executive officers, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities, and secretarial support. Although
the monthly rents and fees was arbitrarily arrived at, we believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the Menlo Park, California area, that the
fees charged by Sand Hill Security, LLC is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person.

 

We intend to use the excess working capital shown above for director and officer
liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve in the event
that due diligence, legal, accounting, and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below.

 

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

 

Sand Hill Security, LLC, an affiliate of our directors and executive officers,
has entered into a revolving credit agreement with us in the amount of $60,000.
Advances under the credit facility will be used to pay a portion of the expenses
of this offering referenced in the line item above for SEC registration fee,
NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loan will be payable
without interest on the later of July 31, 2004, or the consummation of this
offering. The loan will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering.

 

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be invested in general debt
obligations of the United States Government or other high-quality, short-term
interest-bearing investments so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act.

 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

 

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of a target business, we will pay Sand Hill Security, LLC the
fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business
combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, attending management or
board meetings, and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.

 

Since the role of present directors and management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

 

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust fund."

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for the
following purposes:

 

  •   facilities upgrades and expansion;


 

  •   payment of up to $2,450,000 to holders of our outstanding     
        convertible debt, which has an interest rate of 6.5% per year 
        and is payable on demand upon completion of this offering;

  •   general corporate and working capital purposes.


 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures for each purpose may vary
significantly depending upon numerous factors, including availability of funding
from external sources and the amount of cash, if any, we generate from
operations. The amount of payment on the unconverted convertible debt cannot be
determined at this time. The maximum amount payable if none of the holders
converts is approximately $2,450,000. The convertible promissory notes are
convertible at the option of the holder. We have sent a notice to holders of
these notes explaining their right to convert or to accept payment, but we do
not expect to have precise information prior to completion of this offering as
to which holders intend to convert their notes. The notes are convertible into
common stock at the lesser of $6.00 per share or the initial public offering
price per share.

 

We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the net proceeds we
receive from this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion
in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above,
we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term,
investment-grade interest-bearing securities."

of our development and commercialization efforts, the amount of proceeds
actually raised in this offering and the concurrent private offering to
Novartis, the amount of cash generated through our collaboration with Novartis
and by our operations, and the timing of Novartis' exercise, if any, of its
option to license our HCV and other drug candidates.

investment in, companies, technologies or assets that complement our business.

        Our debt obligations to Lighthouse Capital Partners were incurred in
several advances between August 2003 and December 2003 under a secured line of
credit, which we entered into in May 2003. The total amount of our borrowings
was $3.0 million and these borrowings bear interest at a nominal rate of 11% per
annum. We used the proceeds from these borrowings for general corporate
purposes. Under the terms of the agreement governing this secured line of
credit, we must repay each advance, plus outstanding interest, in equal monthly
installments beginning approximately six months after the date of the advance
and continuing for a period of 30 months, or until the full amount of the
principal is repaid. Upon the final maturity date or the earlier prepayment of
each advance, we also must pay Lighthouse Capital Partners an additional amount
equal to 11% of the advance. Also in May 2003, we granted Lighthouse Capital
Partners a seven-year warrant to purchase up to 400,000 shares of our Series E-1
preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share as additional payment
for the secured credit line. As of July 19, 2004, we had approximately
$2.8 million in advances outstanding under this secured line of credit, with
final maturity dates ranging from August 2006 to December 2006.

        Although we have no current plans, agreements or commitments with
respect to any acquisition, we may, if the opportunity arises, use an
unspecified portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in new products,
technologies or businesses.

        As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all
of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion
of this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend
on numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts,
our sales and marketing activities, the amount of cash generated or used by our
operations and competition. Accordingly, our management will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying
on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds
of this offering.

        Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above purposes,

We incurred all the indebtedness described in the table above, other than the
$1.0 million term loan in October 2003, (1) for working capital purposes, (2) to
refinance then existing term loans with our senior lender, and (3) to finance
the redemption of shares of our common stock for $15.0 million. We incurred the
$1.0 million term loan in 2004 to finance the purchase of real estate.

 

Net proceeds from this offering after repayment of indebtedness are
approximately $39.3 million. We intend to use this balance to fund future growth
through the opening of de novo stores and opportunistic acquisitions and for
future working capital requirements. As of the date of this prospectus, we have
entered into fully executed leases for 22 de novo store locations and are
actively negotiating leases for 52 additional de novo store locations. From time
to time, we evaluate and consider potential acquisition candidates that may
become available. We have no current plans, arrangements, or understandings
related to any material acquisitions.

 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the shares of common stock sold by
the selling stockholders pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option, if
exercised."

shares to be sold by us will be $46.1 million, after deducting underwriting

not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling
stockholders.

      We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

   •  approximately $9.5 million to pay a mandatory conversion and dividend       
      payment to holders of outstanding shares of our Series B Convertible        
      Participating Preferred Stock;

      We will retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds of this
offering. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, such as our ability to identify
potential acquisition candidates and the progress of our international expansion
efforts. Pending application, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

      The principal purposes of this offering are (i) to create a public market
for our common stock for the benefit of our stockholders, (ii) to attract and
retain qualified employees by providing them with equity incentives, (iii) to
ensure that we have the necessary funds to pay mandatory redemption, conversion
and dividend payments to certain holders of our preferred stock and (iv) to
ensure that we have sufficient funds for working capital and general corporate
purposes, including potential acquisitions. The consideration for any potential
acquisition could consist of cash, stock or a combination of both. As of the
date of this prospectus, we have no binding agreements or commitments with
respect to any acquisition."

offering are estimated to be $25.3 million ($29.4 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) based on the public offering price
of $7.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and our estimated offering expenses.

 

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures from the net proceeds will
depend on numerous factors, including the timing and number of new hires in our
sales and marketing organization, the status of our research and development
efforts, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering, the amount of
cash, if any, generated by our operations and the amount of competition we face.
We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment
in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our business.
However, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter
into any potential acquisitions or investments. We currently estimate that of
the net proceeds, we will spend approximately $4.0 million to expand our sales
and marketing organization; approximately $4.0 million to expand our research
and development efforts, including approximately $1.0 million on updates to our
IVIS Imaging Systems, $1.5 million on development of new imaging systems and
$1.5 million on development of animal models; approximately $5.0 million to
expand our manufacturing capacity for IVIS Imaging Systems, including
approximately $2.0 million in capital investment; and the remainder for working
capital, including approximately $4.0 million on manufacturing and inventory,
$2.0 million on key management hires, $3.0 million on expansion of our animal
facility, $1.0 million on legal infrastructure and $2.0 million on product
development. Our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net
proceeds from this offering and may spend the proceeds from this offering in
ways that our stockholders may not deem desirable.

 

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering as described above, we intend to
invest the funds in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities
and U.S. government securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested
will yield a favorable return."

shares of Class A common stock in this offering at an initial public offering
price of $13.00 per share, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $1.5
billion or approximately $1.7 billion if the underwriters exercise in full their
option to purchase additional shares. Concurrently with the completion of this
offering, we expect to issue an aggregate of $1.25 billion of debt, which will
be offered and sold solely to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A and in offshore transactions to persons other than U.S. persons as defined
in Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We expect to
distribute to Motorola approximately $1.0 billion. The distribution amount is
determined based on a formula which leaves us with approximately $750 million in
net cash and cash equivalents (i.e., total cash minus total debt, including debt
resulting from the concurrent notes offering). We will retain the remainder of
the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

 

In addition, if the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option, the net
proceeds of approximately $227 million from our sale of approximately 18 million
shares of Class A common stock will also be distributed to Motorola (after
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering
expenses payable by us).

 

We have agreed to repay working capital loans to an affiliate of Motorola,
entered into subsequent to April 3, 2004 and estimated to be in the amount of
$428 million, as of the closing of this offering. We expect to repay these loans
with cash received by us in connection with the reorganization which was
completed on May 2, 2004 and cash generated from operations subsequent to April
3, 2004."

for working capital purposes. Our revolving line of credit has an interest rate
of LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum. JPMorgan Chase Bank, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan

working capital and other general corporate purposes, including sales and
marketing and research and development expenditures, as well as the repayment of
certain indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding amount of approximately

business through strategic alliances or acquisitions with other companies,
products or technologies. While we have no current plans for any specific
acquisitions at this time, we may use a portion of the proceeds for these
purposes.

   We have not yet determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically

significant discretion and flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the
offering. Pending any use, as described above, we intend to invest the net

In May 2000, in connection with HBMC’s leveraged buyout from First Tennessee
Bank, Abetterwayhome Corp. entered into an uncommitted $60 million revolving
loan arrangement with Bank of Montreal. Interest on this revolving loan accrues
at the prime rate and is payable quarterly, or at any other time upon the demand
of Bank of Montreal. The principal amount outstanding is also payable at any
time on demand, and there is no stated maturity date. We may prepay the
principal amount outstanding at any time without premium or penalty.

 

In April 2004, Abetterwayhome Finance, LLC II entered into a $500 million
uncommitted master repurchase agreement with Bear Stearns Mortgage Capital
Corporation for the aggregation of adjustable-rate mortgage loans. The master
repurchase agreement bears interest at the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 1.00% per

over-allotment option is exercised in full, based on an initial public offering
price of $14.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting discount and our
pro rata share of the estimated offering expenses. We intend to contribute $55.7
million of the net proceeds that we receive from this offering to our insurance
companies, which would increase their statutory surplus. Our insurance companies
will purchase high quality marketable securities consistent with our investment
policies with the cash received. This additional capital will permit us to
reduce our reinsurance purchases and retain more gross premiums written over
time. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds that we receive of $1.0
million for general corporate purposes, including the funding of working capital
needs and the payment of company expenses and stockholder dividends. Pending the
uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.

 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common
stock by selling stockholders. The selling stockholders will receive all of the
net proceeds from the sales of common stock offered by them under this
prospectus."

the sale of 8,000,000 ADSs after deducting the underwriting discounts and
expenses payable by us in the offering. We will not receive any proceeds from
the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders. We currently intend to use the net
proceeds to us as follows, though the allocation of the use of proceeds may
change along with evolving business conditions and other management
considerations:

†  up to $40 million for acquisitions or investments in businesses that we      
   believe are complementary to our existing business, although no acquisitions 
   or investments are pending;                                                  
  
†  up to $8 million for product development;                                    
  
†  up to $8 million for sales and marketing; and                                
  
†  remaining balance for general corporate purposes.                            


To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not
immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to use them for our
working capital, to purchase U.S. Treasury debt securities and other short-term
investment grade debt securities or to deposit the proceeds into
interest-bearing bank accounts. These investments may have a material adverse
effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ADSs.
It is possible that we may become a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC,
for United States federal income taxpayers, which could result in negative tax
consequences to you. These consequences are described in more detail in
“Taxation.”

Our industry is evolving rapidly and could cause significant and rapid changes
to our strategies and business plans. Accordingly, the actual application of the
proceeds may change. As new business opportunities arise or circumstances
change, we may reallocate all or part of the net proceeds to other business
plans or new projects or hold such funds in temporary investments."

being sold by us in this offering will be $38.9 million at the initial public
offering price of $12.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting discount
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The net proceeds to the selling
stockholders from the sale of the 2,038,124 shares of common stock being sold by
them in this offering will be $22.7 million at the initial public offering price
of $12.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting discount. We will not
receive any portion of the net proceeds received by the selling stockholders
from the sale of their shares. We will receive net proceeds of approximately
$48.6 million if the underwriters’ over allotment option is exercised in full.

 

We intend to use the net proceeds for working capital and other general
corporate purposes, including expanding sales and marketing, research and
development, repayment of all of our indebtedness to Silicon Valley Bank and
certain other lenders and general and administrative efforts. In particular, at
the closing of this offering, we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to
repay outstanding convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount
of approximately $7.6 million, together with accrued interest on the notes,
which we issued in a bridge financing in March 2004. These notes bear interest
at the rate of 10.0% per annum and are due on the earliest of March 18, 2005 or
30 days after the closing date of this offering or a change of control
transaction. In addition, at the closing of the offering, we intend to use a
portion of the net proceeds to repay to Silicon Valley Bank all outstanding
loans owed to Silicon Valley Bank under our credit lines. As of March 31, 2004,
we owed a total of $11.0 million under these credit lines. Upon repayment of all
indebtedness to Silicon Valley Bank, we intend to exercise our right to
terminate our amended and restated loan and security agreement, and our accounts
receivable financing agreement will terminate automatically upon the closing of
this offering. We also might use a portion of the net proceeds for the
acquisition of technologies, businesses or products that are complementary to
our business, although no such acquisitions are planned or being negotiated as
of the date of this prospectus, and no portion of the net proceeds has been
allocated for any specific acquisition.

 

The amounts we plan to spend on each area of our operations, including capital
expenditures as well as the timing of any expenditures, are determined by
internal planning and budgeting processes, and may change over time. Pending
such uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested according to a
cash management policy adopted by our board of directors, which includes
short-term, investment-grade securities."

    •  make an $82.2 million cash distribution to Holly Corporation and its        
       affiliates, in part to reimburse them for certain capital expenditures;

       At the closing of this offering, we will borrow $25.0 million under our
credit agreement to fund an additional $25.0 million cash distribution to Holly
Corporation. The $30.1 million of debt we owe to Holly Corporation is payable on
demand and bears no interest. This debt was incurred in connection with the
acquisition of an additional 45% interest in Rio Grande Pipeline Company and the
acquisition of the Woods Cross assets.

       The proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option
will be used to redeem a number of common units from Holly Corporation and its
affiliates equal to the number of common units issued upon exercise of the
over-allotment option at a price per common unit equal to the proceeds per
common unit before expenses but after underwriting discounts and commissions."

      We have no immediate need for the proceeds we will receive from this
offering. The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional
capital, to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our
future access to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds
from this offering to provide additional long-term capital, in the form of
unrestricted cash, to support the growth of our business by providing us with
financial flexibility. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to pursue acquisitions and expansions of health plans and contracts for
government-sponsored health programs in existing and new markets or to acquire
or invest in complementary businesses. We have no commitments with respect to
any such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved in any
negotiations with respect to any such transaction.

      As of the date of this prospectus, we have not identified the particular
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the status of our market expansion efforts, sales and
marketing activities, amount of cash generated or used by our HMO operations,
and competition. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering.

$20,400,000, or $23,730,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as
determined by our board of directors at that time.

The payment to Fu & Tong LLC of a monthly fee of $500 is for general and
administrative services including secretarial support.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $468,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $125,000 for
the twenty-four month period commencing on the date of this prospectus), with
the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting
and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed
our estimates.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

Dr. Simon Mu, our chief executive officer, president and a member of our board
of directors, advanced to us $11,668, and Dr. Bing Zhao, our chief financial
officer, secretary and a member of our board of directors, and Daniel Kunz, our
chairman of the board, each advanced to us $11,666, aggregating $35,000, which
was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees
and expenses. The loans bear interest at a rate of 4% per year and are payable
on the earlier of April 22, 2005 or the consummation of this offering. These
loans will be repaid out of the gross proceeds of this offering.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be invested in general debt
obligations of the United States Government or other high-quality, short-term
interest-bearing investments so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. The interest income derived from
investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray our
general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

No compensation of any kind (including finders and consulting fees) will be paid
by us to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement from us for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since
the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we
have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on her portion of the trust fund) only in the event
of our liquidation or if she were to seek to convert her shares into cash in
connection with a business combination which she voted against and which we
actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund."

of the 14,142,135 shares of Class A common stock offered by us in this offering,
based upon our initial public offering price of $85.00 per share, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. We will not receive any of the net proceeds from the sale of the
shares by the selling stockholders.

 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets.

 

We currently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds of this
offering. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds received by us from
this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital. In
addition, we may use a portion of the proceeds of this offering for acquisitions
of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. We have no current
agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions.

 

Pending such uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds in highly liquid,
investment grade securities."
SNB BANCSHARES INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/snb-bancshares-inc-638947-39931,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/snb-bancshares-inc-638947-39931,424B3,8/18/2004,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3133368,"We estimate that our net proceeds from our sale of 4,727,273 shares of our
common stock in this offering (based on the public offering price of $10.50 per
share) will be approximately $45.3 million, after deduction of offering expenses
estimated to be $850,000 and underwriting discounts and commissions. If the
underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full, we anticipate that the
net proceeds from the sale of our common stock will be approximately
$52.2 million after deduction of offering expenses and underwriting discounts
and commissions.

      The principal reasons for conducting this offering at this time are to
raise capital to increase our regulatory capital ratios and support anticipated
growth, increase the liquidity of our common stock in the public market and
facilitate future access to capital markets. Due to the significant asset growth
that we have experienced, as of June 30, 2004, our leverage ratio has declined
to 4.50% from 5.09% as of December 31, 2003 and 6.33% as of December 31, 2002.
Under the Federal Reserve’s guidelines, our minimum required leverage ratio is
4.00%. We believe that given the favorable market for bank stocks, it is in the
best interests of our shareholders to raise additional capital through a public
offering rather than a private offering because of the higher valuation likely
to be obtained. We also believe that having a publicly traded stock would give
us additional flexibility to issue either cash, common stock or both in
connection with possible acquisitions.

      We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

   •  to support anticipated balance sheet growth, including contributions to the 
      capital of Southern National Bank and the opening of additional branches;   
  
   •  for possible acquisitions; and                                              
  
   •  for general corporate purposes.                                             


      From time to time in the ordinary course of our business we evaluate
potential acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material. At the
present time, we do not have any plans, arrangements or understandings relating
to any acquisition.

      We have not yet determined and are unable to quantify the amount of net
proceeds to be used specifically for each of the foregoing purposes. The precise
amounts and timing of the application of the net proceeds from this offering
depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, the amount of any such
proceeds and actual funding requirements. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Until the
proceeds are used, we may invest the proceeds, depending on our cash flow
requirements, in short and long-term investments, including, but not limited to,
treasury bills, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, securities issued by
U.S. government agencies, money market funds, repurchase agreements and other
similar investments."

or $99.7 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in
full. We intend to use these net proceeds to enhance our asset management
platform by expanding our investment capabilities, launching new products, and
expanding distribution, and for general corporate purposes. This may include
providing seed or organizational capital for new closed-end and open-end mutual
funds, making strategic acquisitions of asset managers, and funding distribution
expenses. We intend to use approximately $3.3 million during the third quarter
of 2004 to acquire a 50% equity interest in Houlihan Rovers S.A., a Brussels,
Belgium based manager of real estate securities and to invest the remaining
proceeds in short-term investments until we identify additional specific uses."

million and approximately $243.5 million if the underwriters’ overallotment is
exercised in full. After deducting the underwriting discount, financial advisory
fees, and estimated expenses of this Offering (excluding prepaid expenses), we
expect net proceeds from this Offering of approximately $192.1 million and
approximately $221.7 million if the underwriters’ overallotment is exercised in
full. If the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full, we expect
to use the additional net proceeds (which will be approximately $29.6 million)
for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

 

We will contribute the net proceeds from this Offering to our Operating
Partnership. In addition, prior to or simultaneously with the consummation of
this Offering, we will make an initial draw under our revolving credit facility.

 

Pending application of any portion of the net Offering proceeds, we will invest
it in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing securities as
is consistent with our intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Such
investments may include, for example, obligations of the Government National
Mortgage Association, other government and governmental agency securities,
certificates of deposit and interest-bearing bank deposits.

 

The following table provides information related to the expected Offering
proceeds, revolving credit facility and uses of such proceeds. Amounts related
to repayment of indebtedness and completion of construction properties were
determined utilizing June 30, 2004 balances and will differ at the time of the
consummation of this Offering due to principal amortization, borrowings under
construction facilities and progress on our construction projects.

in this offering will be approximately $43.9 million. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate our net proceeds will
be $50.6 million. Net proceeds are what we expect to receive after paying the
underwriters’ discount and other expenses of the offering. We will not receive
any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling
stockholders. We intend to use our net proceeds for general corporate purposes,
which may include:

   •  making capital contributions and loans to our banking and non-banking       
      subsidiaries;                                                               
  
   •  increasing capital ratios to support our asset growth;                      
  
   •  establishing de novo branches;                                              
  
   •  increasing working capital;                                                 
  
   •  leveraging the growth of our subsidiary IBE; and

      We have not specifically allocated the amount of the net proceeds that
will be used for these purposes; however, we believe that we will be able to
deploy the net proceeds of this offering in a manner that will maximize the
return to our investors. We are effecting this offering at this time because we
believe that based on our current financial position and considering our
historical growth and development and our prospects for the future, we have
reached a stage where we are ready to be a public company with access to the
public markets. Pending the optimal investment of the net proceeds, we intend to
invest such proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing securities, certificates of
deposit or guaranteed obligations of the United States."

and approximately $264.8 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions,
financial advisory fees and estimated expenses of the offering.

 

We will contribute the net proceeds of the offering to our operating
partnership. In addition, concurrently with the closing of the offering we
expect to enter into a variable rate mortgage loan in the aggregate principal
amount of $37.0 million with U.S. Bank, and a fixed rate mortgage loan in the
aggregate principal amount of $111.0 million with Wachovia Bank, N.A. The U.S.
Bank mortgage, which will be secured by five properties, will bear interest at a
variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 175 basis points and will mature in three
years after its inception. We also expect to initially borrow an additional
$10.2 million under our variable rate line of credit to partially fund the
transactions described below. The Wachovia loan, which will be secured by the
26 properties that we expect to acquire in the Storage Spot transaction, will
bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 150 basis points above the five-year
Treasury rate and will mature in 2010. We have been proffered a binding
commitment letter from U.S. Bank relating to the U.S. Bank loan and from
Wachovia relating to the Wachovia loan. We do not intend to use the proceeds of
these two mortgage loans to fund distributions.

 

Wells Fargo, N.A., an affiliate of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, one of the
underwriters in this offering, is the lender under our property credit line and
our corporate credit line. We will use a portion of the net proceeds of this
offering to repay these lines of credit, as described below.

The following table sets forth the sources and uses of funds that we expect in
connection with the offering and the U.S. Bank loan, the Wachovia loan and our
line of credit described above. Some of the uses indicated in the following
table could be funded from other sources, such as additional cash on hand or our
proposed line of credit.

Pending the use of any cash proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
interest-bearing, short-term investment-grade securities or money-market
accounts which are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. Such
investments may include, for example, government and government agency
certificates, certificates of deposit, interest-bearing bank deposits and
mortgage loan participations.

 

Any net proceeds remaining after the uses set forth in the table above will be
used for working capital purposes, including future acquisitions and development
activities. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option for the
offering in full, we expect to use the additional net proceeds to us, which will
be approximately $35.2 million in aggregate, for working capital needs,
including future acquisitions and developments. We do not intend to use any of
the net proceeds from this offering to fund distributions to our stockholders,
but to the extent we use these proceeds to fund distributions, these payments
will be treated as a return of capital to our stockholders.

Our repayment of existing indebtedness and related loan exit fees related to our
initial assets consists of the following:

Executive Officer, has guaranteed the payment of these loans. For more

we will repay a short-term note issued to Strategic Performance Fund, Inc. in
the amount of $3.7 million which bears interest at a rate of 15.9% per annum and

stock we are offering will be approximately $38.2 million. If the underwriters
fully exercise the over-allotment option, the net proceeds will be approximately
$44.3 million. “Net proceeds” are what we expect to receive after we pay the
underwriting discount and other estimated expenses for this offering.

       The principal purposes of this offering are to solidify our working
capital position to support our continuing growth and to create a public market
for our common stock. We expect to use the net proceeds of the offering for:

    •  working capital;                                                            
   
    •  continued sales, marketing and clinical support initiatives relating to the 
       commercialization of our products; and                                      
   
    •  continued research and development, including the enhancement of our        
       existing system through ongoing product and software development, the design
       of new proprietary disposable interventional devices for use with our system
       and the development of next generation versions of our system.              


       In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
to repay outstanding lines of credit. We have three secured equipment financing
facilities with Silicon Valley Bank. As of June 30, 2004, one facility had an
outstanding balance of approximately $368,000, with a maturity date of December
2004, the second facility had an outstanding balance of approximately $413,000,
with a maturity date of September 2005 and the third facility had an outstanding
balance of $2.0 million, with a maturity date of June 2007. Borrowings under the
first two facilities bear interest at an annual rate of 10% and borrowings under
the third facility bear interest at an annual rate of 7%. We also have a secured
revolving line of credit to provide working capital. This revolving line accrues
interest at the lender’s prime rate plus 1.25%, subject to a minimum interest
rate of 5.25%, and matures in April 2006. As of June 30, 2004 we had
$1.25 million outstanding under this working capital line.

       We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds, if any, for general
corporate purposes, which may include the purchase of equipment and the
expansion or relocation of facilities. We have not yet determined the amount or
timing of the expenditures for each of the categories listed above and these
expenditures may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, including
the timing of additional regulatory approvals and new product introductions. As
a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net
proceeds of this offering.

       From time to time, we have discussed potential strategic acquisitions and
investments with third parties. Currently, we have no agreements or commitments
to enter into any such transactions. Pending our uses of the proceeds, we intend
to invest the net proceeds of this offering primarily in short-term, investment
grade, interest-bearing instruments."

      term loan that matures in July 2010.                                        


      To the extent the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option, we may
use the net proceeds from such sale for general corporate purposes, including
the additional repayment of indebtedness and/or the repurchase of common stock
held by the principal stockholder at the then prevailing market price.

      Pending the uses described above, we may use net proceeds from this
offering to make short-term investments or for general corporate purposes.

      In July 2003, we issued $380.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
8 3/4% senior notes due 2011 and borrowed $120.0 million under the senior
secured term loan due in 2010 in order to repay in full all outstanding amounts
under our then-existing revolving credit facility, term loan and 9.5% Senior A
and B notes. Amounts outstanding under our senior secured term loan currently
bear interest at either the Eurodollar Rate plus 3.75% or Bank of America’s
prime rate plus 2.75%. As of June 30, 2004, amounts outstanding under the term
loan bore interest at 4.96%."

the Fund. We will not receive any proceeds from the 5,230,000 shares (or
6,014,500 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in
full) sold in the offering by the Fund. Based on the initial public offering
price per share of our common stock of $20.00 per share, we estimate that our
net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $6.8 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $8.2 million. We plan to
use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, working
capital, financing internal growth, possible future acquisitions of financial
institutions, branch offices and loan portfolios. We do not currently plan to
contribute any of the net proceeds from this offering to the capital of the
bank.

 

We regularly explore opportunities for, and engage in discussions relating to,
potential acquisitions of financial institutions and related businesses, and
also regularly explore opportunities for acquisitions of assets and liabilities
of financial institutions, bank branches and other financial services providers.
We do not currently have any agreement or definitive plans relating to any such
acquisition or for the use of any portion of the proceeds from this offering for
those purposes.

 

The amounts actually expended for working capital purposes may vary
significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of
our future revenues and the other factors.
Accordingly, our management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of
the net proceeds of this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the
proceeds in short-term, investment-grade investments."

$28.5 million, after deducting approximately $3.5 million in estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. If
the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full, then we estimate
that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately
$32.9 million.

      We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for working
capital and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our media and other
businesses, repayment of the remaining balance, if any, on our promissory note
to our majority stockholder and for general corporate purposes as follows:

   •  We expect to use approximately $10 million of the net proceeds to expand the
      WPT Studios business. We expect to spend approximately $4 million to        
      $5 million of this amount on capital expenditures for purchase of production
      equipment and development of our production studios and post-production     
      facilities. The remainder of these expenditures would be production,        
      marketing and administrative expenses, principally for international        
      expansion, development of new branded entertainment concepts, and expansion 
      of our existing brand into other media, such as home entertainment and      
      radio.                                                                      
  
   •  We expect to use approximately $5 million of the net proceeds to expand the 
      WPT Consumer Products and WPT Corporate Alliances Business and to expand    
      into other businesses. These expenditures would be principally for          
      operational and marketing staff for publishing, expansion of our web site   
      and other communications, additional staffing for our licensing operations, 
      startup costs of new events for sponsorship, and investment in development  
      of licensed gaming equipment, among other businesses.                       
  
   •  We expect to use approximately $5 million for corporate expenses relating to
      our expansion, including increased brand marketing, additional expenses     
      relating to our status as a public company and professional fees for        
      intellectual property protection.                                           
  
   •  If there is any balance remaining on our promissory note to Lakes Poker     
      Tour, LLC, our majority stockholder, we will repay the balance with a       
      portion of the net proceeds. The note payable accrues interest quarterly at 
      a rate of 6.20% and is due on March 4, 2005. As of July 28, 2004, the       
      principal and interest balance of the note was $0. The loan is a revolving  
      credit facility and advances under the loan in the past year have been      
      short-term borrowings used for working capital.                             
  
   •  The remaining proceeds, if any, will be used for general working capital    
      purposes.                                                                   


      Although we expect to apply the net proceeds to the general categories in
the amounts indicated above, our management will continue to evaluate the
appropriate uses for our cash resources as we continue to expand our business.
Our company will only make a proposed expenditure, including a capital
expenditure, as business needs dictate after an analysis of the costs and
benefits of the expenditure. For each investment we make in a new business
opportunity, management will continue to evaluate whether that opportunity is
satisfying the financial goals established by management. Management may change
its business plans in the future to allocate resources away from businesses that
do not satisfy such financial goals.

      We believe the proceeds of the offering, along with anticipated revenues,
will be sufficient to support our operations for at least the next 12 months and
into the foreseeable future. Until we use the net proceeds of the offering, we
intend to invest them in short term, interest-bearing securities."

of the proceeds for general corporate purposes. We also may use a portion of the
net proceeds to us to fund possible investments in, or acquisitions of,
complementary businesses, products or technologies. We have no current
agreements or commitments with respect to any investment or acquisition, and we
are not engaged in negotiations with respect to any investment or acquisition.

      Pending application of cash proceeds, we will invest such portion of the
net proceeds in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing

      The cash payments made to Messrs. Gold’s and Kreitzer’s parents include
loan repayments of $75,000 and $25,000, respectively. The value and the number
of the units that we will issue in exchange for contributed property interests
was determined by our executive officers based on the costs incurred to acquire
and improve the properties, a discounted cash flow analysis, an internal rate of
return analysis and an assessment of the fair market value of the properties. No
single factor was given greater weight than any other in valuing the properties,
and the values attributed to the properties do not necessarily bear any
relationship to the book value for the applicable property. We did not obtain
any recent third-party property appraisals of the properties to be contributed
to our operating partnership in the formation transactions, or any other
independent third party valuations or fairness opinions in connection with the
formation transactions. As a result, the consideration we pay for these
properties and other assets in the formation transactions may exceed their fair
market value."

this offering will be approximately $36.4 million. We will not receive any of
the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling
stockholders.

      We intend to use approximately $11.2 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay our outstanding subordinated indebtedness and approximately
$25.2 million to reduce our borrowings under our existing senior credit
facilities.

      The principal terms of the outstanding indebtedness being repaid as of
March 31, 2004 consist of the following:

   •  $3.0 million of subordinated notes issued in September 2002 to certain of   
      our principal stockholders. These notes bear interest at a rate of 12% per  
      annum and have a maturity date of September 30, 2006. Interest on the notes 
      is payable in kind on a monthly basis.                                      
  
   •  $8.2 million of subordinated notes originally issued to affiliates of       
      certain of our principal stockholders in June 2000. These notes bear        
      interest, payable monthly, at a rate of prime plus 1.25% (5.25% as of       
      March 31, 2004) and have a maturity date of June 28, 2006.                  
  
   •  $15.4 million of revolving credit borrowings and a $40.8 million term loan  
      under a senior credit facility that matures on January 2, 2006. Borrowings  
      under this credit facility bear interest at various rates plus a margin     
      based on certain financial ratios. As of March 31, 2004, borrowings under   
      the revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of   
      5.5% per annum and borrowings under the term loan bore interest at a        
      weighted average rate of 5.4%. As of June 30, 2004, there were $12.7 million
      of revolving credit borrowings and $39.2 million of term loan borrowings    
      under this facility.                                                        
  
   •  $8.4 million of revolving credit borrowings and term loans aggregating      
      $35.3 million under a senior credit facility that has a final maturity date 
      of June 28, 2006. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at    
      various rates plus a margin based on certain financial ratios. As of        
      March 31, 2004, borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest
      at a weighted average rate of 5.25% per annum and borrowings under the term 
      loans bore interest at a weighted average rate of 5.5%. As of June 30, 2004,
      there were $5.1 million of revolving credit borrowings and term loans       
      aggregating $34.4 million under this facility. Affiliates of certain of our 
      principal stockholders are lenders under this credit facility and, as of    
      March 31, 2004, held an aggregate of $14.3 million of such indebtedness. As 
      of June 30, 2004, the aggregate amount of such indebtedness held by these   
      stockholders was approximately $12.5 million, which will be repaid from the 
      net proceed of this offering.                                               


      As of March 31, 2004, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to this
offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described above,
we would have had total indebtedness of approximately $84.4 million, or
approximately 52% of our capitalization. All amounts remaining outstanding under
our existing senior credit facilities after application of the net proceeds of
this offering will be repaid in connection with the execution of a new senior
credit facility, which will be effective upon completion of this offering. Our
new senior credit facility will provide for a $40.0 million revolving credit
facility and a $65.0 million term loan. We believe that our cash generated from
operations together with borrowings under our new senior credit facility will
provide us with sufficient liquidity to pursue our business strategy.

      An aggregate of $23.7 million of the net proceeds from this offering will
be used to repay indebtedness held by our principal stockholders or their
affiliates."

of common stock we are offering will be approximately $37.7 million, at an
initial public offering price of $7.00 per share and after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full,
we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $43.6 million. The
selling stockholder will receive net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million, at
an initial public offering price of $7.00 per share and after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by the selling
stockholder. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, it
is estimated that the selling stockholder's net proceeds will be approximately
$2.2 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common
stock by the selling stockholder.

        The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working
capital, which may be used to support hiring additional sales and marketing
personnel, expand research and development or increase hosting capabilities; to
create a public market for our common stock; and to facilitate future access by
us to public markets. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to
acquire complementary products, technologies or businesses. However, as of the
date of this prospectus, we have no commitments or agreements and are not
involved in any negotiations to make any material acquisitions. Pending use of
the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds
generally in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. Our
management will have broad discretion concerning the allocation and use of all
of our net proceeds received in this offering."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $30 million,
or approximately $35 million if the underwriters fully exercise their
over-allotment option, in each case based on the initial public offering price
of $8 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

 

As of August 4, 2004, we had approximately $1.6 million in cash and cash
equivalents. These existing resources combined with the approximately $30
million of expected net proceeds from the offering will provide us with
sufficient cash to accomplish our research and development goals described
below. Previously, we had allocated the net proceeds as follows:

 

    •  approximately $20 to $25 million of the net proceeds to fund further 
       development of NRP104, our product candidate for the treatment of    
       ADHA;                                                                


 

    •  approximately $10 to $15 million of the net proceeds to fund further 
       research and development of NRP290, our product candidate for the    
       treatment of acute pain; and                                         


 

    •  approximately $5 to $15 million of the proceeds to fund preclinical  
       testing and research and development of NRP369, our product candidate
       for the treatment of pain, and other potential product candidates, as
       well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.          


 

On July 29, 2004, we met with staff members of the Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research of the FDA to discuss NRP104 and determine the additional clinical
and nonclinical trials appropriate to support an NDA with respect to NRP104.
Based upon this meeting and the lower-than-expected expenses we have actually
incurred in the development of our registration batches of NRP104, we have
revised our developmental budget and currently intend to use the net proceeds
from the offering as follows:

 

    •  approximately $10 to $15 million of these proceeds to fund further   
       development of NRP104;                                               


 

    •  approximately $5 to $10 million of these proceeds to fund further    
       research and development of NRP290; and                              


 

    •  approximately $5 to $15 million of these proceeds to fund preclinical
       testing and research and development of NRP369, and other potential  
       product candidates, as well as for working capital and general       
       corporate purposes.                                                  


 

The following is a detailed breakdown of the budgetary changes with respect to
the development of NRP104:

 

    •  The staff of the FDA has indicated to us that we do not need to       
       conduct pre-clinical carcinogenicity studies. We had budgeted for this
       study in our previous estimates and, therefore, reduced the budget by 
       approximately $5 million.                                             


 

    •  Based on our meeting with the staff of the FDA, we were also able to 
       reduce the overall size of our pivotal clinical trials by 100        
       patients from the number of patients we had previously thought would 
       be enrolled in our pivotal clinical trials. This further reduces our 
       development budget by approximately $3 million.                      


 

    •  We had budgeted approximately $5 million toward the development of   
       validation batches of NRP104. Based on the amount we actually        
       incurred on the development of registration batches, we estimate that
       the development of validation batches should not exceed $3 million.  
       This further reduces our development budget by approximately $2      
       million.                                                             


We believe that, based on the outcome of our recent meeting with the staff of
the FDA on NRP104, we would enjoy reductions in our budgeted development costs
with respect to NRP290. In particular, we are able to now remove from our budget
for the development of NRP290 approximately $5 million that had been budgeted
for preclinical carcinogenicity studies. Based on our recent meeting with the
staff of the FDA on NRP104, we do not believe that such studies will be
necessary for NRP290. Consequently, we estimate that approximately $5 to $10
million (and not approximately $10 to $15 million as previously allocated) of
the net proceeds from the offering will be needed to fund further research and
development costs on NRP290.

 

Based upon these budgetary savings, we expect that the net proceeds of
approximately $30 million, together with existing cash and cash equivalents,
will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to enable
us to achieve the following stages of the development process for each of our
lead product candidates: (i) to have completed the FDA review of our NDA for
NRP104, (ii) to be in late stages of NDA review by the FDA on NRP290 and (iii)
to be in early stages of NDA review by the FDA on NRP369. However, because of
the uncertainties associated with the product development process, we cannot
accurately predict the stage to which we expect to be able to advance our
product candidates with the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash resources. As to both our clinical and preclinical programs, it is possible
that we will not achieve the progress that we anticipate because the actual
costs and timing of development, particularly clinical trials, are difficult to
predict, are subject to substantial risks and often vary depending on the
particular indication and development strategy. As a result, we may need to
raise additional funds from external sources to achieve the expected development
progress described in this paragraph.

 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our research,
development and commercialization efforts, the progress of our clinical trials,
and our operating costs and capital expenditures. Accordingly, we will retain
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering, and we
reserve the right to change the allocation of use of these proceeds as a result
of contingencies such as the progress and results of our clinical trials and our
research and development activities, the results of our commercialization
efforts, competitive developments and our manufacturing requirements.

 

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade
securities."

        We intend to spend approximately $1.8 million on sales related
activities, including salaries for sales leadership and management personnel,
regional and international sales agents and staff, domestic and international
travel and entertainment, sales commissions (because sales commissions, although
usually success based, are occasionally required to be paid by us in advance,
especially now as we are developing our reputation), referral costs, other
incentives, expansion of sales channels, sales partnerships and alliances and
the establishment of international sales offices in Europe and the Asia/Pacific
region.

        Approximately $1.8 million of the proceeds will be used for research and
development, or R&D. The R&D expenditures will include expansion of existing
products, acceleration of new functionality, development or procurement of
additional product lines and the costs of acquiring and incorporating other
technology components into our products.

        We intend to spend approximately $1.5 million on marketing activities,
including hiring and engaging marketing professionals, advertising, search
engine expenses, branding and awareness campaigns, lead generation programs
(such as proactively calling, mailing and e-mailing prospective purchasers of
our products), website enhancement, partnership expenses, public relations,
engaging industry analysts, conference attendance, creation of technical papers
describing the results of tests on our products' functionality and customer
loyalty events and expenditures.

        We assume that we will use approximately $550,000 to repay certain debt.
This includes: $96,000 to repay a bank line of credit (interest at 6.5%,
guaranteed by Mr. Yeros, repayable in August 2005 and used for general corporate
purposes); a demand note of $52,000 from a non-related individual (interest at
10% per annum, secured by a certain receivable for which the Company has now
received payment and used for general corporate purposes); and $400,000 to repay
the August 2004 bridge loan received from certain officers and directors, which
bridge loan bears interest at 12% per annum and is repayable within 180 days.

        We intend to use the balance of the proceeds of this offering, estimated
at approximately $1.7 million, (approximately $3.0 million if the underwriter's
over-allotment is exercised in full) as well as cash generated from operations,
for working capital and for general corporate purposes. We expect that the $1.7
million will be evenly divided among the following categories: non-sales,
non-marketing and non-R&D related personnel costs; the additional costs of being
a public company including audit fees, legal fees and compliance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; customer service costs; and general office overhead
and expenses such as rent, telecommunications, internal IT and insurance costs.
If we do not generate cash from operations sufficient to repay certain
additional debt due in the amount of $620,000 in September 2005, we may have to
use some of the offering proceeds to repay such debt.

None of the proceeds will be used to pay any past due compensation amounts to
officers or directors because there are no such amounts.

        Should the underwriters' over-allotment be exercised we may consider
investing in additional sales alliances, pursuing a greater number of OEM
agreements, hiring additional sales and marketing personnel, launching an
expanded advertising campaign, investing in complimentary technologies,
broadening marketing plans and/or in accelerated product development. In
addition, any over-allotment proceeds may be used to finance acquisitions of
complimentary businesses. While we currently have no acquisitions, agreements or
commitments pending, we may consider those companies that add additional product
functionality, those that may add an attractive customer base and those that may
add additional distribution capabilities.

        Actual expenditures may vary substantially from these estimates. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors,
including the status of our product development efforts, marketing and sales
activities, and the amount of cash generated by our operations. We may find it
necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds for other purposes.

        Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds
include opportunities or the need to take advantage of additional marketing
activities, the change in timing of our international sales initiatives,
increased costs of doing business internationally over those currently expected,
the need to accelerate, increase or eliminate the release of product
enhancements due to changing market conditions, changes in the costs we incur to
procure or license technologies included in our products and/or the need for us
to spend additional sums on intellectual property and patent protection.

        We believe that strategic acquisitions of other businesses will likely
be necessary for us to achieve growth and profitability. We will likely fulfill
some of our plans by acquiring complementary businesses, products or
technologies. From time to time, we evaluate these potential acquisitions and we
anticipate continuing to make such evaluations. We have no current agreements or
commitments with respect to any such acquisitions but we anticipate that we will
use some of the proceeds of this offering to make strategic acquisitions in the
future. Pending any of these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

offering to provide additional capital to Primus Financial in order to increase
its capacity to sell additional credit swaps. Primus Financial will invest this
additional capital in accordance with its operating guidelines in United States
government securities and money market instruments. The remainder of the
proceeds from the offering will be used as working capital and for general
corporate purposes, including providing additional capital to Primus Financial
to enable it to further expand its credit swap business and to pursue
opportunities in complementary businesses, such as asset management for third
parties and selling credit swaps referencing a broader range of obligations. 
While specific amounts have not been allocated for
these additional purposes, we believe that raising capital under current market
conditions will provide sufficient flexibility to our management to dedicate
appropriate amounts to the specific purposes enumerated above as suitable
opportunities arise. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of
common shares by the selling shareholders.

We are conducting this offering at this time in order to create a public market
for our common shares and, as described above, to raise at least $60 million for
contribution to Primus Financial. It is economic and efficient, in the context
of the pending offering, for us to raise additional capital that we will have
available for future expansion of our business.

Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering, not contributed to Primus Financial, in United States

the actual use of the proceeds may vary significantly and will depend on a
number of factors, including our future revenue and cash generated by operations
and the other factors described in “Risk Factors.” Accordingly, our management
will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering.
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high quality,
investment grade instruments, which include corporate, financial institution,
federal agency or U.S. government obligations."

$15.1 million (or $17.4 million if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is
exercised in full), after deducting the underwriter’s discounts and estimated
offering expenses.

      We will use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to support the
continued growth of our business operations and for general corporate purposes.
We expect that we will retain approximately $1 million to $2 million of the net
proceeds, and contribute the remainder to Valley Bank. Valley Bank intends to
use the additional capital to:

   •  Support continued loan growth;                                              
  
   •  Buy back portions of loans which Valley Bank had participated to other      
      financial institutions because of limits on its lending capacity;           
  
   •  Hire new, qualified personnel to facilitate growth in our loan portfolio;   
      and                                                                         
  
   •  Expand our banking franchise in the Las Vegas metropolitan area by opening  
      new branch offices and possibly through selective acquisitions. (We have no 
      present understanding or agreement or definitive plans concerning any       
      specific acquisitions).                                                     


      Prior to our deployment of the net proceeds as described above, we intend
to place the proceeds of the offering into investments that are consistent with
our investment policy.

      The board of directors of Valley Bancorp determined to proceed with this
offering at its meeting on April 28, 2004. Based on the asset growth that Valley
Bancorp has experienced since mid-2003 and the perceived strength of the local
economy, the board instructed Valley Bancorp’s management in March 2004 to make
a recommendation on how to best fund recent and anticipated growth. Management,
after consulting with Valley Bancorp’s financial advisors, determined that the
issuance of additional shares of common stock, as opposed to some form of
borrowing, was a preferable long-term strategy to fund growth and maintain
appropriate capital ratios for bank regulatory purposes.

      We anticipate that the offering will close on or before September 30,
2004. In the event that this does not occur, we may borrow approximately
$2.0 million from an unaffiliated financial institution and downstream all or a
portion of such borrowing to Valley Bank as capital, in order to assure that
Valley Bank remains “well capitalized” under applicable banking regulations as
of September 30, 2004 (which is the date on which Valley Bank’s FDIC insurance
premium is calculated). If we do effect such borrowing, we would use a portion
of the proceeds to repay the loan."

Chase Bank, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., is a lender and
administrative agent for the other lenders under the secured credit facility,

operating company had outstanding borrowings under this facility of $170 million
as of June 30, 2004, bearing interest at variable interest rates that are
adjustable based on our performance (4.13% at June 30, 2004). We incurred the
borrowings under this facility to fund our acquisition by Apollo."

       favorable to us or Saxon Capital has previously retired the note;

    • the remainder, if any, for working capital.

prove incorrect, we may find it necessary to reallocate a portion of the
proceeds within the above-described categories or use portions of the proceeds
for other purposes. Our estimates may prove to be inaccurate, new programs or
activities may be undertaken which will require considerable additional
expenditures or unforeseen expenses may occur. Pending use, we will invest the

related securities similar to those we already own, primarily those issued by
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. We have not, however, identified any
specific mortgage related securities to purchase with the net proceeds of this
offering. We expect to fully invest the net proceeds of this offering in
mortgage related securities within approximately three months of closing the
offering and to implement our leveraging strategy to increase our investments in
mortgage related securities to our desired level within approximately three
additional months. Pending full investment in mortgage related securities, we
intend to invest the funds in interest-bearing short-term investment grade
securities or money market accounts consistent with our intention to qualify as
a REIT. These investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we
hope to achieve from our intended investments."

3,675,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting underwriting
discounts but before paying estimated offering expenses. Concurrently with the
closing of this offering, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately
$79.0 million from the private placement of senior secured notes by our
subsidiaries, after deducting the private placement fee but before paying
estimated offering expenses.

 

We intend to use the net proceeds of $70.3 million from this offering, together
with the net proceeds of $79.0 million from the private placement of senior
secured notes by our subsidiaries, to:

 

    •   repay approximately $132.7 million in debt of CFSI LLC, including
        $103.1 million in a term loan, $26.5 million of revolving debt   
        outstanding under the existing credit facility and $3.1 million  
        in other outstanding debt;                                       


 

    •   pay approximately $9.7 million of expenses associated with this  
        offering, the proposed private placement of senior secured notes 
        and the related formation and contribution transactions; and     


 

    •   reserve approximately $6.9 million for general partnership       
        purposes, including for the construction of mausoleum crypts and 
        lawn crypts and for the purchase of equipment needed to install  
        burial vaults.                                                   


 

As of June 30, 2004, approximately $103.1 million in a term loan and $25.5
million of revolving debt was outstanding under the existing credit facility.
The term loan and the outstanding revolving debt bear interest at the aggregate
rate of 4.5% plus the greater of LIBOR and 3.5%, which aggregate rate was 8.0%
as of June 30, 2004. Beginning on September 15, 2004, the term loan and
revolving debt bear interest at the rate of 18.0% per annum with 2.0% increases
on each of January 1, 2005 and April 1, 2005. The term loan and revolving debt
are due and payable on June 30, 2005. As of June 30, 2004, we had $2.4 million
in other outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% per year
and a weighted average maturity of 1.5 years.

 

If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised, we will use one-half of
the net proceeds for general partnership purposes, and we will use the other
half to redeem from CFSI LLC a number of common units equal to the number of
common units sold upon exercise of the over-allotment option. As a result, CFSI
LLC will be deemed to be a selling unitholder. CFSI LLC will use the net
proceeds from this redemption to repurchase a portion of its Class A membership
interests. 
 

Pending application of the $6.9 million of proceeds reserved for general
partnership purposes, we may invest those proceeds in short-term marketable

or approximately $345.0 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full. After deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions, financial advisory fees and estimated expenses of this offering
(including approximately $4.5 million loaned to us by GI Partners to pay costs
related to this offering and the formation transactions), we expect net proceeds
from this offering of approximately $270.0 million, or approximately $311.9
million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full.

In addition, concurrently with or shortly after the completion of this offering,
our operating partnership or the property-owning entities will use the fee
simple interests in seven properties to secure approximately $215.0 million of
new mortgage loans. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Material
Provisions of Consolidated Indebtedness to be Outstanding After this Offering”
for a description of the indebtedness we will incur.


We will use the net proceeds from this offering and the new mortgage loans to:

    •   purchase 6,810,036 operating partnership units issued in connection with   
        the formation transactions (having an aggregate value of approximately     
        $102.2 million based on the midpoint of the pricing range indicated on the 
        front cover of this prospectus) from the investors in GI Partners at a     
        price per unit equal to the per share public offering price of our common  
        stock in this offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and  
        financial advisory fees payable to the underwriters, or $95.0 million in   
        the aggregate, based on the midpoint of the pricing range indicated on the 
        front cover of this prospectus;                                            

    •   pay the $15.0 million cash portion of the consideration to acquire the 200 
        Paul Avenue and 1100 Space Park Drive properties. See “Certain             
        Relationships and Related Transactions—200 Paul Avenue and 1100 Space Park 
        Drive Contribution Agreement”;                                             

    •   acquire the 75% interest in the eBay Data Center property upon consummation
        of this offering and the remaining 25% interest therein in early 2005 for a
        total of $14.3 million;                                                    

    •   repay approximately $243.7 million under a bridge loan facility with an    
        affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.; and                            

    •   repay an aggregate of approximately $110.3 million of mortgage loans, other
        secured loans and notes payable under GI Partners’ line of credit,         
        including prepayment penalties, as more fully described below.             

In addition, if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we will
purchase additional units from the investors in GI Partners in an amount equal
to the number of shares sold pursuant to such exercise at a price per unit equal
to the per share public offering price of our common stock in this offering, net
of underwriting discounts and commissions and financial advisory fees payable to
the underwriters, for an aggregate of $41.9 million, based on the midpoint of
the pricing range set forth on the front cover of this prospectus and assuming
exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in full.

Any net proceeds remaining after the uses set forth above will be used to fund
general working capital and potentially to fund future acquisitions. Pending
application of cash proceeds, we will invest the net proceeds in
interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing securities, which are
consistent with our intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT.

If the initial public offering price of our common stock is below the midpoint
of the pricing range indicated on the front cover of this prospectus, our
operating partnership intends to borrow funds under our unsecured credit
facility and use these funds, in addition to the net proceeds of this offering
and the new mortgage loans, to make the payments set forth above.

A tabular presentation of our estimated use of proceeds from this offering is as
follows:

(1)   Includes repayment of approximately $4.5 million loaned to us by GI Partners
      to pay costs related to this offering and the formation transactions.       


The remaining funds necessary to consummate the formation transactions will be
borrowed under the new mortgages or, if necessary, our unsecured credit
facility.

In connection with the formation transactions, we intend to repay to an
affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. $243.7 million of the $251.7 million
secured bridge loan obtained for purposes of providing temporary financing for
the acquisition of AboveNet Data Center, Brea Data Center, Comverse Technology
Building, Hudson Corporate Center, Savvis Data Center, Siemens Building, Webb at
LBJ and Carrier Center. As summarized above, a portion of the proceeds from the
offering, totaling $175.0 million, will be used to partially fund this
repayment. The remaining amount of the repayment will be funded through proceeds
from the $215.0 million in new mortgage loans that are expected to close
concurrently with, or shortly after completion of this offering. The interest
rate on the secured bridge loan is LIBOR plus 2.0% and it matures in August
2005, except that if we consummate this offering prior to December 31, 2004,
then this loan will mature on December 31, 2004. If this offering is consummated
after December 31, 2004, then the maturity of this loan will accelerate to the
closing date of this offering, subject to a three-month extension option in the
event the closing of this offering occurs before September 30, 2005.

In connection with the formation transactions, we intend to repay an approximate
$13.9 million loan, including prepayment penalties, secured by our interest in
the ASM Lithography Facility, which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%
(but at least 4.75%) per annum, that was incurred on June 30, 2003 and matures
on June 30, 2006, with two one-year extensions available.

In addition, in connection with the formation transactions, we intend to repay
an aggregate of $96.4 million of mortgage, mezzanine and revolving indebtedness,
including prepayment penalties, with a weighted average interest rate of
approximately 6.3% and an average remaining term to maturity of approximately
0.8 years upon consummation of this offering. The amounts loaned to us by GI
Partners to pay costs related to this offering and the formation transactions
that we will repay do not bear interest and are payable upon 10 days’ notice.

Exact payment amounts with respect to indebtedness may differ from estimates due
to amortization of principal, accrual of additional interest or prepayment fees
and incurrence of additional transaction expenses."

we will receive in rubles. This amount represents net proceeds after deducting
estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering. We expect
to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes:

 

   •   $† million for capital expenditures, including the purchase of   
       equipment and modernization of facilities; and                   


  •   $† million for acquisitions of additional operations and subsoil licenses.


 

We are not currently engaged in any discussions or negotiations with any
acquisition target in which the completion of an acquisition has reached the
probable stage.

 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs representing
common shares offered by the selling shareholders.

 

Until the registration of a placement report regarding the placement of shares
underlying the ADSs by the Federal Service for the Financial Markets, the
proceeds from this offering will be held in escrow and escrow-type accounts at
UBS AG and Raiffeisenbank Austria ZAO, a Russian subsidiary of Raiffeisenbank
Zentralbank sterreich AG. The terms of the deposit of funds into these accounts
will provide that the net proceeds will be released to us, and that the sums due
to the selling shareholders and the underwriters will be released to them, only
upon the registration of the placement report. Although under Russian law the
placement report should be registered within two weeks after the report is filed
with the Russian Federal Service for the Financial Markets, the registration may
take longer or may not occur at all."

sale of 6,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts but before paying estimated offering expenses.
We base this amount on an assumed initial public offering price of $21.25 per
common unit.

    We intend to use the net proceeds of approximately $118.6 million from this
offering to:

        º repay $93.8 million of outstanding indebtedness under our existing
          credit facility;

        º provide $20.5 million of working capital;

        º pay $1.0 million of costs incurred in connection with amending and
          restating our existing credit facility;

        º distribute $0.2 million to United States Shipping Master LLC to
          reimburse it for certain capital expenditures made by it related to
          assets that we will own after the offering; and

        º pay $3.1 million of expenses associated with this offering.

    As of September 30, 2004, we had outstanding under our existing credit
facility approximately $193.8 million of term loans and a letter of credit in
the amount of $966,000, which letter of credit reduces availability under our
revolving credit facility. The revolving credit portion of the facility expires
on April 13, 2009. Term loans are repaid in quarterly installments with a final
maturity on March 31, 2010. Outstanding loans bear interest at a rate equal to,
at our option, either: (1) in the case of Eurodollar loans, the sum of the LIBOR
rate for loans in an amount substantially equal to the amount of borrowing and
for the period of borrowing selected by us plus a margin of (a) 2.25% in the
case of term loans and (b) between 1.75% and 2.25% in the case of revolving
credit loans, depending on our total debt leverage ratio (as defined in the
credit agreement) or (2) in the case of base rate loans, the higher of (a) the
administrative agent's prime or base rate or (b) one-half percent plus the
latest overnight federal funds rate plus in each case a margin of between 0.75%
and 1.25%, depending on our total debt leverage ratio. The interest rate for our
term loans at September 30, 2004 was 4.12%. We incurred this indebtedness in
April 2004 and used the proceeds to refinance a prior credit facility, acquire
the Charleston, repay a subordinated note to Hess, finance a portion of the cost
of constructing our ATB, pay a distribution to members of United States Shipping
Master LLC and pay related transaction fees.

    If the over-allotment option is exercised, we will use the net proceeds to
redeem from United States Shipping Master LLC a number of common units, equal to
the number of common units issued upon exercise of that option, at a price per
common unit equal to the net proceeds per common unit after underwriting
discounts and commissions but before other expenses. We will redeem these common
units as a reimbursement for certain capital expenditures made by United States
Shipping Master LLC related to assets that we will own after the offering."

establish joint ventures, including potentially up to US$3.4 million for our
potential acquisition of Ray Time. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Potential Acquisition” for a

----------
(1)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
     received from Mr. Levy described below. These funds will be repaid out of
     the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation
     of this offering.


         $20,640,000, or $23,736,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option
is exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at 
JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
New York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the 
target business may be used to finance operations of the target business or to 
effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of directors at that time.


         The payment to ProChannel Management LLC, an affiliate of Laurence S.
Levy, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, of a monthly fee of
$7,500 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by
ProChannel Management for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Levy
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the New York, New York metropolitan area, that the fee
charged by ProChannel Management is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination,
we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

         We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $235,000, or
$433,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for director and
officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $60,000), with the balance
of $175,000, or $373,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient
to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.


         To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.


         Laurence S. Levy, our chairman of the board and chief executive
officer, has advanced to us a total of $70,000 which was used to pay a portion
of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loan
will be payable without interest on the earlier of June 10, 2005 or the
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.


         The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

         We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

         Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the
consummation of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay ProChannel
Management the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder's and
consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since
the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we
have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

         A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
fund (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund)
only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek
to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust fund."

----------
(1)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
     received from Mr. Levy described below. These funds will be repaid out of
     the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation
     of this offering.


         $20,640,000, or $23,736,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option
is exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at 
JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
New York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the 
target business may be used to finance operations of the target business or to 
effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of directors at that time.


         The payment to ProChannel Management LLC, an affiliate of Laurence S.
Levy, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, of a monthly fee of
$7,500 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by
ProChannel Management for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Levy
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the New York, New York metropolitan area, that the fee
charged by ProChannel Management is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination,
we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

         We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $235,000, or
$433,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for director and
officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $60,000), with the balance
of $175,000, or $373,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient
to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.


         To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.


         Laurence S. Levy, our chairman of the board and chief executive
officer, has advanced to us a total of $70,000 which was used to pay a portion
of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loan
will be payable without interest on the earlier of June 10, 2005 or the
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.


         The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

         We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

         Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the
consummation of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay ProChannel
Management the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder's and
consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since
the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we
have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

         A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
fund (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund)
only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek
to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust fund."

initial public offering price of $16.50 per share (the mid-point of the range
set forth on the cover page of this prospectus), after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

    The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
Class A common stock, obtain additional equity capital and facilitate future
access to public markets. We intend to use $45.7 million of the net proceeds of
this offering to purchase 3,000,000 newly issued membership units directly from

proceeds from this offering as described above, assuming both no exercise and
full exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option.

the proceeds from our acquisition of membership units directly from it to make
payments to certain of our employees in connection with the termination of our
EAU plan, and approximately $39.6 million of the proceeds (1) to expand our
alternative investment business, which consists of non-registered investment
vehicles, primarily hedge funds, offered by us to qualified investors, and
(2) for general corporate purposes. The amounts actually expended for the
expansion of our alternative investment business will depend on a number of
factors, including market conditions and the timing of available opportunities,
as well as the amount of cash generated by our operations. Any amounts not used
to expand our alternative investment business will be used for general corporate
purposes. Pending their use, the proceeds of this offering may be invested in
short-term, investment grade securities deemed appropriate by us.

    Calamos Family Partners, Inc. has agreed to invest at least 50% of the
after-tax net proceeds from its sale of membership units in Calamos Holdings LLC
to us, estimated to be approximately $110 million, in investment products
managed by our subsidiaries. Calamos Family Partners, Inc. has also agreed that
it will maintain its investment in investment products managed by our
subsidiaries for not less than two years."

expenses. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we
estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $60.7 million.

Of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering, we expect to use
approximately:

purposes. We may use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire complementary
products, technologies or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements
or commitments to complete any such transaction and are not involved in
negotiations to do so. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be
based on many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated

$311.9 million, after deducting the underwriters' discount and the estimated
expenses we will pay in connection with this offering and our pending
acquisitions. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase up
to an additional 4,285,714 common shares to cover over-allotments, if any, our
net proceeds will be approximately $359.7 million. We will contribute the net
proceeds from this offering to our operating partnership in exchange for units
of limited partnership interest. Our operating partnership expects to use the
aggregate net proceeds from this offering along with cash on our balance sheet
as follows:

        º approximately $77.3 million to redeem all of Vornado Realty Trust's
          general and limited partnership interests in our operating partnership
          that remain outstanding immediately prior to completion of this
          offering, giving effect to the surrender by Vornado of $50.0 million
          in value of such interests as payment of the exercise price for the
          portion of its warrant to purchase units required to be exercised upon
          completion of this offering, based on its $113.8 million contribution
          to our operating partnership as of the date of this prospectus, plus a
          preferential return to be paid to Vornado in the amount of
          $13.5 million. See ""Our Business and Properties—Our Formation
          Transactions—Structure of Our Operating Partnership"";

        º approximately $184.8 million to fund the equity portion of the
          purchase price of nine student housing properties and two undeveloped
          parcels of land;


        º approximately $17.6 million to fund the purchase price for the
          remaining 90% interest in three student housing properties in which we
          currently own a 10% interest subject to receipt of a consent from the
          holder of the 90% interest, which consent will become effective upon
          completion of this offering;

        º approximately $32.5 million to repay indebtedness incurred by Gary
          M. Holloway in connection with his purchase of a student housing
          property, which will be contributed to our operating partnership upon
          completion of this offering;

        º approximately $4.0 million to fund the cash portion of the aggregate
          consideration payable to Gary M. Holloway in exchange for his
          contribution of assets to our operating partnership in connection with
          our formation transactions and our pending acquisitions, which Mr.
          Holloway has agreed to pay to certain of our employees, a trustee
          nominee and employees of entities affiliated with Mr. Holloway as
          bonus payments for services performed; and

        º to the extent we do not complete all of these transactions, we expect
          to use the remaining proceeds to fund our working capital needs, and
          the acquisition of additional student housing assets, including
          pending acquisitions that we have under contract or under a
          non-binding letter of intent, but with respect to which we have not
          yet completed our due diligence investigation to a substantial enough
          degree to consider them probable of completion, military housing
          privatization projects that we may identify in the future, and for
          other general corporate purposes. If we are unable to complete the
          acquisition of the property subject to a non-binding letter of intent,
          we may identify other properties to acquire in their place.

    We may need a significant amount of time to fully deploy the remaining net
proceeds from this offering and to fully implement our leverage strategy to
maximize our investments. Pending full deployment of the net proceeds, funds
will be invested in money market accounts and marketable short-term investment
grade securities. These investments are expected to provide a lower net return
than we hope to achieve from our intended real estate investments. We may
leverage our temporary investments in these securities to the extent required to
maintain our REIT status."

investments in, businesses, products and technologies. We have not allocated
specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes. We have no current

      outstanding balance of $421.0 million at the closing of this offering;

    If the public offering price is below the midpoint of the range indicated on
the front cover of this prospectus, we expect to fund a portion of the uses
described above with a draw on our revolving credit facility.

    The approximately $285.9 million remaining outstanding under our existing
term loan provided by an affiliate of Lehman Brothers after application of the
net proceeds of this offering as described above will be repaid with the net
proceeds from three proposed new fixed rate mortgage loans, which we also expect
will be provided by affiliates of Lehman Brothers, and from the $18.7 million
which we will receive from Robert J. Amsdell, Barry L. Amsdell, Todd C. Amsdell
and the Amsdell Entities as described above. For more information, refer to “Our
Business and Facilities — Outstanding Indebtedness — Proposed Additional Fixed
Rate Mortgage Loans.” As of June 30, 2004, our existing term loan bore interest
at a floating rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 3.0%, or 4.11% per annum. The term
loan matures in May 2005, with two three-month extension options which are
exercisable at our option.

    The approximately $6.2 million of existing indebtedness secured by four of
our existing facilities was incurred pursuant to four separate loans. As of
June 30, 2004, approximately $1.1 million of that existing indebtedness bore
interest at 9.35% and matures in April 2006, approximately $2.1 million bore
interest at 7.51% and matures in February 2008, approximately $1.0 million bore
interest at 7.38% and matures in May 2008 and approximately $2.0 million bore
interest at 7.55% and matures in September 2009.

    The approximately $10.4 million of existing indebtedness secured by the
three facilities being contributed in connection with the formation transactions
was incurred pursuant to four separate loans. As of June 30, 2004, approximately
$5.7 million of that existing indebtedness bore interest at 3.25% and matures in
August 2004, approximately $2.0 million bore interest at 3.25% and matures in
December 2004, approximately $0.7 million bore interest at 3.61% and matures in
December 2006 and approximately $2.0 million bore interest at 7.00% and matures
in April 2009.

    If the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase 3,690,000 shares is
exercised in full, we will receive additional net proceeds of approximately
$61.8 million. We will use these additional proceeds for general working capital
purposes, including the potential acquisition and development of additional
facilities."

private placement, based on (1) the sale of 13,000,000 shares of our common
stock at the initial public offering price of $8.50 per share, after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering
expenses, and (2) the concurrent private placement of 500,000 shares of our
common stock stock to an affiliate of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.
at a price per share equal to the offering price, after deducting the
placement fee, will be approximately $104.0 million. We estimate that our net
proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement will be
$109.0 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full.

   We plan to use approximately $3.5 million to $7.5 million of the net
proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement to acquire a
shell insurance company with multi-state property and casualty licensing, with
the amount of the purchase price depending on the number of licenses. We hope
to complete such an acquisition within one year from the date of this
offering, although we are not currently engaged in discussions regarding any
such potential acquisition. In addition, immediately after the offering we
plan to pay off the entire remaining balance of our loans with CIT Group/
Equipment Financing, Inc., which we estimate will be approximately $5.0
million at that time. The annual interest rate on these loans is LIBOR plus
4.50%. We also plan to redeem the 30,000 outstanding shares of our Series A
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $1.5 million. The Series A
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock pays dividends at an annual rate of
10.5%. We plan to contribute the remaining balance of the proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement to TICNY and to any shell
insurance company we may acquire to support their premium writings, which may
increase through acquisitions of renewal rights and in force books of
business, as well as organically. We will not receive any of the proceeds from

$ 9.00 per ordinary share. Abengoa has agreed to fully reimburse our offering
expenses. We will not receive any of the proceeds of any sale of ordinary shares
by the selling shareholders if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option to purchase ordinary shares from them.

     The principal purpose of this offering is to enable us to implement our
business strategy. After deducting underwriting discounts, we anticipate that
80-90% of the proceeds we receive, or $ 58.3 million to $ 65.5 million, will be
used for acquisitions (including the payment of up to € 1.5 million of deferred
contingent purchase price in connection with our recent acquisitions of ICX
Sistemas, S.A., which is located in Spain, and the western region business unit
of Xwave Solutions Inc., which is located in Canada), joint ventures and equity
investments in “B-O-T” projects, and 5-15%, or $ 3.6 million to $ 10.9 million,
will be used to finance the expansion of our products and services solutions
through our research and development efforts. Any remaining proceeds we receive
will be used for general working capital purposes. We do not intend to use these
proceeds to cancel our outstanding debt or invest in capital expenditures.

     We have not yet determined the exact amount of net proceeds to be used
specifically for each of the preceding purposes. The exact amount of proceeds
used for any specific purpose could change based on a number of factors
affecting our business, such as changes in the economy or as a result of
opportunities that arise. At this time we have no binding commitments for any
future acquisitions. Accordingly, our board of directors and our management will
have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering.
Pending the application of the net proceeds of this offering as described above,
we plan to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing accounts at international
financial institutions. We will not lend the proceeds of this offering to
Abengoa pursuant to our credit arrangements with it."

borrowing under our new term loan facility to purchase from the Contributing
Entities 12,247,984 membership units in Sunstone Hotel Partnership and pay
certain expenses of the Contributing Entities, and will contribute the remaining

     REPAYMENT OF DEBT. This amount reflects the outstanding principal balance
of all indebtedness evidenced by notes, debentures and other debt instruments as
of September 30, 2004 held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, Freshstart Venture Capital
Corp., James Brodie and Bigan Saliani. It does not include the repayment of any
capital lease obligations. The note payable to James Brodie, having an
outstanding principal balance of $52,000, bears interest at 9% and is due and
payable out of the proceeds of this offering. The note payable to Bigan Saliani,
having an outstanding principal balance of $6,000, was issued in November 2003
in connection with the repurchase of stock from a stockholder and matures in
October 2004. The JPMorgan Chase indebtedness matures in 2006 and currently
bears interest at the rate of 5.5%. The Freshstart indebtdness matures in 2006
and 2008 and currently bears interest at the rate of 11.75% and 9.25%,
respectively. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources"" for a more
detailed description of these obligations.

     DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CONTENT. This amount reflects the cost of developing new
content that can be offered to a broad client base or that can serve as the
basis of a customized program for a specific client. Initially, we expect that
our focus will be to develop new content for our engineering library and for
Working Values. To develop this new content we may use our internal resources or
we may hire third party contractors. In these cases, the cost will primarily be
the salaries and benefits payable to our employees who develop the content or
the consulting fees payable to the contractors. We may also purchase specific
existing content, as opposed to purchasing content in the context of a larger
acquisition of a group of assets, from third parties. In this case, in addition
to the cost of the content itself, there may be additional costs relating to
modifying the content so that it will qualify for continuing professional
education credit and so that it can be delivered over our technology platform.
We have not yet made any final determination as to how much we will spend on
specific content or what content we will create, although we have had some
general discussions internally and with existing and potential clients as to
what content they would like us to offer. In addition, we have not contracted
with any third parties to create new content for us and we have not investigated
the availability of specific content for purchase.

     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. This amount consists primarily of property, plant and
equipment, such as computer and communications equipment, needed to support an
increase in business activity. It also includes the cost of upgrading our
accounting software should we determine that an upgrading is necessary. It may
also includes the capitalized portion of the costs to further upgrade, enhance
and improve the functionality of our proprietary learning content management
system that are properly capitalizable under applicable accounting principles.

     WORKING CAPITAL. The majority of the net proceeds of this offering will be
used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
The costs to be incurred in connection with acquisitions include not only the
consideration for the assets or property acquired but also any related legal,
accounting, investment banking and due diligence costs. We believe that the most
efficient way for us to grow, expanding our share of the markets we currently
serve and entering into new markets, is through strategic acquisitions. We may
acquire an entire business entity or a group of assets, depending on business,
economic and financial considerations. Our focus will be on acquisitions that
will enable us to increase the size of our content offerings and/or expand our
customer base. In addition to the markets we currently serve, we will use
acquisitions to penetrate new market segments such as insurance, financial
services and healthcare. Currently, we have no agreements or commitments to make
any acquisitions. We may also use the proceeds allocated to working capital for
general corporate purposes and to reduce our accounts payable and accrued
expenses. We may also use a portion of these proceeds to hire additional sales
and marketing personnel if we deem that to be necessary. If the representative
exercises the over-allotment option, the additional net proceeds, approximately
$1.05 million, will be added to working capital.

     The above information represents our best estimate of our capital
requirements based upon the current status of our business. We will retain broad
discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds within the categories listed
above. The amounts actually expended for these purposes may vary significantly
and will depend on a number of factors, including our rate of revenue growth,
cash generated by operations, evolving business needs, changes in demand for our
products, the cost to develop or acquire new programs for our libraries, our
marketing efforts, competitive developments, new strategic opportunities,
general economic conditions and other factors that we cannot anticipate at this
time.

     Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
interest-bearing, investment grade securities, or, if necessary to avoid being
designated an Investment Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
United States government securities.

     We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, when combined with cash
flow from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital
requirements for at least 12 months following this offering. We may be required
to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or other securities
sooner if our operating assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate. We cannot
assure you that any financing of this type would be available. In the event of a
capital inadequacy, we would be required to limit our growth and the
expenditures described above."

and our estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from the
sale of common stock by the selling shareholders who propose to sell an
aggregate of 1,142,919 shares of common stock to the underwriters.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for
our common stock, to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets,
and to obtain additional capital. We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering for the repayment of a $5.0 million term loan and for general corporate
purposes, including working capital. The $5.0 million term loan matures in April
2006 and has a variable interest rate of prime plus 2.75% with a minimum rate of
7.75%. As of August 31, 2004, the interest rate on our $5.0 million term loan

any such business or products.

mid-point of the range on the front cover of this prospectus, and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses

we estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $50.6 million. We
will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders. As of June 30, 2004, we had $11.4 million in cash and cash
equivalents.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds of this offering,
together with our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from
operations, to fund our operations, including:

  • approximately $10.0 million for sales and marketing activities;              
 
  • approximately $6.0 million for clinical research and product development; and
 
  • the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.      


The amounts actually expended for these purposes may vary significantly and will
depend on a number of factors, including future sales growth, if any, the amount
of cash we generate from future operations, the actual expenses of operating our
business, opportunities that may be or become available to us and the other
factors described under “Risk Factors.” In addition, we will retain broad
discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. Should we
determine to employ cash resources for the acquisition of complementary
businesses, products or technologies, the amounts available for the purposes
cited above may be significantly reduced. Although we evaluate strategic
investments or potential acquisitions in the ordinary course of business, we
have no specific understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any
acquisition or investment at this time.

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above purposes, we intend
to invest the funds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing

favorable return."

from the sale of the shares of common stock subject to the over-allotment option
for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The anticipated expenditures in the table set forth above assumes the conversion
of all of our outstanding convertible secured promissory notes and convertible
secured debentures into shares of our common stock. The principal and interest
due on the notes and the principal due on the debentures is convertible at the
option of the holders, and they may choose to convert all, none, or any portion
of such amounts into common stock. The interest due on the convertible
debentures is not convertible and must be paid by us in cash. To the extent the
holders of those convertible secured promissory notes and convertible secured
debentures choose to demand cash repayment of the amounts due thereunder instead
of converting those notes and debentures into shares of our common stock, then
we may be required to use up to approximately $3.9 million of the proceeds from
this offering, which we would otherwise expect to use for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, to repay those obligations. We owe
approximately $1.5 million of principal and interest under the convertible
secured promissory notes, which bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum and
which will be due on the earlier of (i) one day before the first maturity date
of any of our outstanding convertible secured debentures, (ii) ten days after we
complete an initial public offering of our common stock, or (iii) December 31,
2004. We owe approximately $2.4 million of principal under the convertible
secured debentures, which were issued between August and November 2003, bear
interest at the rate of 8% per annum and which are due on the earlier of (i) the
first anniversary of their issuance, or (ii) 15 days following the completion of
a financing with net proceeds to us of at least $10 million. We used the
proceeds from the issuance of the convertible secured debentures for general
working capital purposes.

The foregoing represents our current best estimate of the allocation of the net
proceeds of this offering, based on the expected use of funds necessary to
finance our existing activities in accordance with our management’s current
objectives and market conditions. The amounts actually expended by us for each
purpose may vary significantly depending on a number of factors, such as the
amount of cash used or generated by our operations, opportunities for the
acquisition of assets, technologies or businesses, changes in competitive
conditions and our management’s assessments of our specific operational and
strategic needs. Our management may spend the proceeds from this offering in
ways our stockholders may not deem desirable. See “Risk Factors — Management has
broad discretion to use the proceeds from this offering for business activities
that may not be successful, which could affect the trading price of our common
stock.”

Although we have no current agreements or commitments with respect to any
acquisition, we may, if our management identifies an attractive opportunity, use
a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in products, technologies or
companies. Any such acquisition could result in a substantial reallocation of
the estimated amounts set forth in the table above.

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above purposes, we intend
to invest the funds in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing
securities. We cannot predict whether our investment of the net proceeds will
yield a favorable return. We believe the proceeds from this offering will be
sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months."
CHINA FINANCE ONLINE CO. LTD,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/china-finance-online-co-ltd-649966-41354,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/china-finance-online-co-ltd-649966-41354,424B1,10/15/2004,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3224406,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $58.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and the
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows,
although the allocation of the net proceeds may change along with changing
business conditions and other management considerations:

•  approximately $30.0 million for acquisitions or investments in businesses,     
   products or technologies; and                                                  
  
•  the balance of approximately $28.2 million for the enhancement of our business 
   operations and for general corporate purposes.                                 


In addition, the purposes of this offering also include the retention of
employees by the creation of a public market for our registered ADSs, so that we
may in the future register shares issued to our employees upon exercise of their
options to allow liquidity, and the creation of a public market for our ADSs for
the benefit of our shareholders. We do not currently have any agreements or
understandings to make any material acquisitions of, or investments in, other
businesses.

We do not anticipate needing to utilize the proceeds of this offering in the
immediate future to fund the operations of either CFO Beijing or Fuhua. We may,
however, need to utilize the proceeds to fund CFO Beijing or Fuhua in the future
if they require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions
or to fund their future developments. In that regard, we may make loans to these
entities. Any loans to these entities in China would be subject to PRC
regulations and approvals. For example:

•  loans by us to CFO Beijing, a foreign invested enterprise, to finance its      
   activities cannot in the aggregate exceed $2 million, which is the difference  
   between CFO Beijing’s currently approved total investment amount and its       
   currently approved registered capital amount, and must be registered with the  
   State Administration of Foreign Exchange for the loans to be effective; and    
  
•  loans by us to Fuhua, which is a domestic PRC enterprise, must be approved by  
   the relevant government authority and must also be registered with the State   
   Administration of Foreign Exchange, although in practice we could make loans to
   CFO Beijing and CFO Beijing could in separate transactions make loans to Fuhua 
   through financial intermediaries, without approval from any PRC governmental   
   agencies.                                                                      


We may also determine to finance CFO Beijing by means of capital contributions.
These capital contributions must be approved by the PRC Ministry of Commerce.
Because Fuhua is a domestic PRC enterprise, we are not likely to finance its
activities by means of a capital contribution due to regulatory issues relating
to foreign investment in domestic PRC enterprises, as well as the licensing and
other regulatory issues discussed in “Regulation” elsewhere in this prospectus.
We cannot assure you that we can obtain these government registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or capital
contributions by us to CFO Beijing or Fuhua.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds of the offering. Prior to use, we intend
to place the net proceeds from this offering in short-term investments, which
may include short-term investment grade debt securities or money market
instruments, and place the remaining net proceeds in bank deposits. The
occurrence of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in
application of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described
in this prospectus.

Pending use of the net proceeds pursuant to the allocation described above, our
investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a
passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax
purposes, which could result in negative tax consequences for you."

of 5,000,000 shares of common stock offered by us in this offering
(approximately $29.6 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full), based on the initial public offering price of $6.00 per share,
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering, and our existing cash and
cash equivalents, as follows:


    †    up to $15.0 million to fund the commercialization of Ventavis, including  
         establishing field-based clinical, physician education, and commercial    
         capabilities and distribution arrangements to launch Ventavis;            

  †   up to $8.0 million to fund clinical trials for Ventavis; and

    †    a $9.0 million milestone payment due to Schering AG under our current     
         licensing agreement upon NDA approval for Ventavis.                       


We expect the remainder of these net proceeds and our existing cash and cash
equivalents will be used to fund working capital, capital expenditures, the
licensing or acquiring and developing additional product candidates and other
general corporate purposes. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, such as the progress of our
product development, regulatory requirements and commercialization efforts and
the amount of cash used by our operations. For example, our estimates may change
significantly if we are required to conduct more clinical trials for FDA
approval of Ventavis, or if we acquire or license other products or product
candidates. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of net
proceeds of this offering. We have no present agreements regarding any material
acquisitions.

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering, and existing cash and cash
equivalents, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least
twelve months. Pending the use of net proceeds, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government."

shares of our common stock and 1,300,000 redeemable warrants in this offering
will be approximately $5,637,000, after deducting the underwriting discount and
approximately $330,000 of estimated offering expenses that will be payable by us
from the proceeds of this offering.

We expect to use these net proceeds for the following purposes:

Engineering and product development                        $1,523,465  
Repayment of bridge financing and other indebtedness        1,273,705

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


We expect that the net proceeds from this offering will enable us, prior to the
end of 2004, to:

•   complete the development and testing of commercial-grade versions of our GigE  
    and OC-48 units;                                                              
•   introduce these products to the market and deploy at least 40 of them (enough  
    to establish 20 point-to-point fiber-speed wireless communications links);    
    and                                                                           
•   continue the design and development of our proposed 10 GigE and OC-192 units.  


We intend to use approximately $1,523,465 of the net proceeds of this offering
for engineering and product development and related activities. This amount
includes $1,254,000 for external engineering and development conducted through
our strategic alliance partners and others, including non-recurring engineering
fees, working capital advances and initial component purchases, and $269,465 for
internal engineering and development activities and related costs, including the
salaries and benefits of our engineering personnel, including those of two of
our executive officers, consulting fees and travel and accommodation expenses.

We intend to use approximately $1,273,705 of the net proceeds of this offering
to repay indebtedness, including:

•   $1.0 million to repay the face value of bridge notes issued by us in           
    September 2004 for proceeds to us of $925,000 which bear interest at the rate 
    of 10% per year and mature upon the earlier of the consummation of an initial 
    public offering of our securities and February 28, 2005;                      
•   $150,000 to repay a promissory note issued to Primecast, Inc. in April 2004    
    that bears interest at the rate of 5% per year and matures upon the earlier   
    of the consummation of an initial public offering of our securities and       
    November 1, 2004; and                                                         
•   approximately $123,705 to pay accrued interest estimated through the           
    anticipated closing date of this offering, on all of the foregoing notes and  
    on the 10% convertible notes issued to Ameristock Corp. (all $2,500,000       
    principal amount of which is converting into shares of our common stock upon  
    the consummation of this offering), including $67,000 of accrued interest     
    outstanding as of June 30, 2004.                                              


We intend to use approximately $642,719 of the net proceeds of this offering for
manufacturing, including for costs of materials, both ours and those of our
strategic alliance partners (for the modules and components of our units
manufactured by them), salaries and benefits and manufacturing overhead
allocations.
                                      
We intend to use approximately $479,500 of the net proceeds of this offering for
the purchase and lease of laboratory test equipment used in the design and
testing of our transceiver units’ modules and final test equipment that will be
used in the final testing and assembly of our products.

We intend to use approximately $462,295 of the net proceeds of this offering in
connection with our sales and marketing efforts, including for the salaries and
benefits of our sales personnel, including those of one of our executive
officers, commissions (to both internal sales staff and third-party
distributors) and travel and accommodation expenses.

We intend to use approximately $434,562 of the net proceeds of this offering in
connection with our installation and after-sales service support activities,
including for the salaries and benefits of our service personnel, including
those of one of our executive officers, and for service department overhead
allocations.

The remaining net proceeds of this offering will be allocated to working capital
and general corporate purposes, including for the funding of our overhead
expenses, such as lease payments on our office and operating space, directors
and officers insurance, salaries and benefits for administrative personnel,
including those of two of our executive officers, travel and associated expenses
and other general and administrative costs.

The above represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net proceeds of
this offering. We may, as our development efforts proceed, find it necessary to
reallocate a portion of the proceeds within the above-described categories or
use portions of the proceeds for other purposes, including for acquisitions of
complementary businesses, products or technologies; however, we have no current
agreements or commitments to make any potential acquisition. In addition, our
estimates may prove to be inaccurate, new products or product changes may be
undertaken which require additional expenditures and/or unforeseen expenses may
occur.

Based upon current assumptions relating to our business plan, we anticipate that
the net proceeds of this offering, together with anticipated revenues and
accounts receivable financing commencing in the first quarter of 2005, will
satisfy our capital requirements for at least 12 months following the
consummation of this offering. These assumptions include the following:

•   our initial products are completed on schedule;                                
•   our strategic partners produce as expected;                                    
•   general commercial deployment of our GigE and OC-48 products and successful    
    deployment of 40 of these units prior to the end of 2004;                     
•   revenue recognition commences during the first quarter of 2005;                
•   we are able to secure accounts receivable financing commencing in the first    
    quarter of 2005; and                                                          
•   general commercial deployment of our 10 GigE and OC-192 products commences     
    during the second quarter of 2005.                                            


If we determine to accelerate our business plan or if our plans otherwise change
or our assumptions prove inaccurate, we may need to seek financing sooner than
currently anticipated, incur additional financing or reduce or curtail our
operations. We cannot assure you that financing will become available as and
when needed.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will
realize additional net proceeds of approximately $914,940, which will be added
to our working capital. All or a portion of these over-allotment proceeds may be
used to acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies or otherwise
obtain the right to use complementary technologies that could broaden or enhance
our product roster. However, we have no current agreements or commitments to
make any potential acquisition. In addition, if the 1,300,000 warrants offered
pursuant to this prospectus are exercised, we will realize proceeds related to
their exercise of approximately $6,565,000, before payment of any solicitation
fees that may be due. If and when we receive these additional proceeds, they are
also expected to be allocated to our working capital. See “Underwriting.”

We will invest proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described
above principally in United States government securities, short-term
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest-bearing
investments."

    during the second quarter of 2005.                                            


If we determine to accelerate our business plan or if our plans otherwise change
or our assumptions prove inaccurate, we may need to seek financing sooner than
currently anticipated, incur additional financing or reduce or curtail our
operations. We cannot assure you that financing will become available as and
when needed.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will
realize additional net proceeds of approximately $914,940, which will be added
to our working capital. All or a portion of these over-allotment proceeds may be
used to acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies or otherwise
obtain the right to use complementary technologies that could broaden or enhance
our product roster. However, we have no current agreements or commitments to
make any potential acquisition. In addition, if the 1,300,000 warrants offered
pursuant to this prospectus are exercised, we will realize proceeds related to
their exercise of approximately $6,565,000, before payment of any solicitation
fees that may be due. If and when we receive these additional proceeds, they are
also expected to be allocated to our working capital. See “Underwriting.”

We will invest proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described
above principally in United States government securities, short-term
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest-bearing
investments."
GIGABEAM CORP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/gigabeam-corp-621075-39756,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/gigabeam-corp-621075-39756,424B4,10/15/2004,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3224682,"We estimate that the aggregate net proceeds to us from the sale of the 1,300,000
shares of our common stock and 1,300,000 redeemable warrants in this offering
will be approximately $5,637,000, after deducting the underwriting discount and
approximately $330,000 of estimated offering expenses that will be payable by us
from the proceeds of this offering.

We expect to use these net proceeds for the following purposes:

Engineering and product development                        $1,523,465  
Repayment of bridge financing and other indebtedness        1,273,705

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


We expect that the net proceeds from this offering will enable us, prior to the
end of 2004, to:

•   complete the development and testing of commercial-grade versions of our GigE  
    and OC-48 units;                                                              
•   introduce these products to the market and deploy at least 40 of them (enough  
    to establish 20 point-to-point fiber-speed wireless communications links);    
    and                                                                           
•   continue the design and development of our proposed 10 GigE and OC-192 units.  


We intend to use approximately $1,523,465 of the net proceeds of this offering
for engineering and product development and related activities. This amount
includes $1,254,000 for external engineering and development conducted through
our strategic alliance partners and others, including non-recurring engineering
fees, working capital advances and initial component purchases, and $269,465 for
internal engineering and development activities and related costs, including the
salaries and benefits of our engineering personnel, including those of two of
our executive officers, consulting fees and travel and accommodation expenses.

We intend to use approximately $1,273,705 of the net proceeds of this offering
to repay indebtedness, including:

•   $1.0 million to repay the face value of bridge notes issued by us in           
    September 2004 for proceeds to us of $925,000 which bear interest at the rate 
    of 10% per year and mature upon the earlier of the consummation of an initial 
    public offering of our securities and February 28, 2005;                      
•   $150,000 to repay a promissory note issued to Primecast, Inc. in April 2004    
    that bears interest at the rate of 5% per year and matures upon the earlier   
    of the consummation of an initial public offering of our securities and       
    November 1, 2004; and                                                         
•   approximately $123,705 to pay accrued interest estimated through the           
    anticipated closing date of this offering, on all of the foregoing notes and  
    on the 10% convertible notes issued to Ameristock Corp. (all $2,500,000       
    principal amount of which is converting into shares of our common stock upon  
    the consummation of this offering), including $67,000 of accrued interest     
    outstanding as of June 30, 2004.                                              


We intend to use approximately $642,719 of the net proceeds of this offering for
manufacturing, including for costs of materials, both ours and those of our
strategic alliance partners (for the modules and components of our units
manufactured by them), salaries and benefits and manufacturing overhead
allocations.
                                      
We intend to use approximately $479,500 of the net proceeds of this offering for
the purchase and lease of laboratory test equipment used in the design and
testing of our transceiver units’ modules and final test equipment that will be
used in the final testing and assembly of our products.

We intend to use approximately $462,295 of the net proceeds of this offering in
connection with our sales and marketing efforts, including for the salaries and
benefits of our sales personnel, including those of one of our executive
officers, commissions (to both internal sales staff and third-party
distributors) and travel and accommodation expenses.

We intend to use approximately $434,562 of the net proceeds of this offering in
connection with our installation and after-sales service support activities,
including for the salaries and benefits of our service personnel, including
those of one of our executive officers, and for service department overhead
allocations.

The remaining net proceeds of this offering will be allocated to working capital
and general corporate purposes, including for the funding of our overhead
expenses, such as lease payments on our office and operating space, directors
and officers insurance, salaries and benefits for administrative personnel,
including those of two of our executive officers, travel and associated expenses
and other general and administrative costs.

The above represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net proceeds of
this offering. We may, as our development efforts proceed, find it necessary to
reallocate a portion of the proceeds within the above-described categories or
use portions of the proceeds for other purposes, including for acquisitions of
complementary businesses, products or technologies; however, we have no current
agreements or commitments to make any potential acquisition. In addition, our
estimates may prove to be inaccurate, new products or product changes may be
undertaken which require additional expenditures and/or unforeseen expenses may
occur.

Based upon current assumptions relating to our business plan, we anticipate that
the net proceeds of this offering, together with anticipated revenues and
accounts receivable financing commencing in the first quarter of 2005, will
satisfy our capital requirements for at least 12 months following the
consummation of this offering. These assumptions include the following:

•   our initial products are completed on schedule;                                
•   our strategic partners produce as expected;                                    
•   general commercial deployment of our GigE and OC-48 products and successful    
    deployment of 40 of these units prior to the end of 2004;                     
•   revenue recognition commences during the first quarter of 2005;                
•   we are able to secure accounts receivable financing commencing in the first    
    quarter of 2005; and                                                          
•   general commercial deployment of our 10 GigE and OC-192 products commences     
    during the second quarter of 2005.                                            


If we determine to accelerate our business plan or if our plans otherwise change
or our assumptions prove inaccurate, we may need to seek financing sooner than
currently anticipated, incur additional financing or reduce or curtail our
operations. We cannot assure you that financing will become available as and
when needed.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will
realize additional net proceeds of approximately $914,940, which will be added
to our working capital. All or a portion of these over-allotment proceeds may be
used to acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies or otherwise
obtain the right to use complementary technologies that could broaden or enhance
our product roster. However, we have no current agreements or commitments to
make any potential acquisition. In addition, if the 1,300,000 warrants offered
pursuant to this prospectus are exercised, we will realize proceeds related to
their exercise of approximately $6,565,000, before payment of any solicitation

$37,295,500 from our sale of 4,650,000 shares of common stock in this offering,
after deducting estimated offering expenses and the underwriting discounts and
commissions. If the underwriters exercise their over allotment option in full,
we will receive $43,133,575 in net proceeds.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for
our common stock, to facilitate our access to the public capital markets and to
provide us with flexibility in the future, including the flexibility to acquire
additional businesses, products and technologies either with the net proceeds of
this offering or through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock,
which could be publicly traded, although we do not currently have any agreements
or commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment.

    We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay
all outstanding indebtedness under our senior subordinated promissory note and
the balance for working capital and general corporate purposes. We issued our
senior subordinated promissory note on May 27, 2004 and are using the proceeds
from the note for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate
purposes. We anticipate that the note will become due on the 30th day after the
completion of this offering. The principal amount of the note is $5.0 million,
and the note bears interest at 11% per year, with interest payable monthly.

    We have not allocated a specific portion of our net proceeds from this
offering to any particular purpose, other than repayment of indebtedness under
our senior subordinated promissory note. The amount and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend on numerous factors, such as the progress of our
development and marketing efforts and the amount of cash used by our other
operations. Thus, we will retain broad discretion over the use of the net
proceeds from this offering. Pending these uses, we will invest the net proceeds
of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

(1)  The bridge notes issued in our January and February 2004 bridge financing   
     bear interest at an annual rate of 8% and mature on the earlier of January  
     or February 2005 and the consummation of this offering. Interest from the   
     date of issuance through September 30, 2004 was paid in cash. Interest is   
     payable in cash to the noteholders each month thereafter until the          
     consummation of this offering. As the offering was not consummated by (i)   
     July 28, 2004, with respect to the bridge notes issued on January 30, 2004, 
     or (ii) August 15, 2004, with respect to the bridge notes issued on February
     17, 2004, we are obligated to pay each purchaser a cash amount equal to 1%  
     of the aggregate purchase price paid by such purchaser for the first month  
     and 1.5% for each month thereafter on every monthly anniversary thereof     
     until the applicable securities underlying the bridge securities are        
     registered. If we fail to make such payments in a timely manner, such       
     payments shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month until paid in    
     full. $1,350,000 of the bridge notes being repaid are held by bridge        
     noteholders that have a relationship with one of our underwriters. For a

   Pending any such uses of the proceeds of this offering, we will invest the
net proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing
instruments. We believe that with the net proceeds from the offering, together
with funds generated from operations, we will meet our anticipated capital
funding needs for at least the next 12 months.

   The allocation of the net proceeds of the offering set forth above represents
our best estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding
industry and general economic conditions and our future revenues and
expenditures. If any of these factors change, it may be necessary or advisable
for us to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-described categories
or to use portions thereof for other purposes, such as the acquisition of other
technologies or products. We have no definitive plan with respect to such other
possible uses.

   Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding
application of the proceeds of the offering."
HURON CONSULTING GROUP INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/huron-consulting-group-inc-635178-39458,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/huron-consulting-group-inc-635178-39458,424B4,10/13/2004,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3221442,"We estimate that the net proceeds that we will receive from our sale of
3,333,333 shares of common stock in this offering at the public offering price
of $15.50 per share will be $44.3 million, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder.


We currently estimate that we will use our net proceeds from this offering for
the following:

†   approximately $15.1 million to exercise our option to redeem our outstanding  
    8% preferred stock;                                                           


†   approximately $10.7 million to repay our outstanding 8% promissory notes,     
    including accrued and unpaid interest;                                        

†   an amount sufficient to repay any borrowings outstanding under our credit     
    agreement at the time of the consummation of this offering; and               

†   the balance for general corporate purposes, including working capital.


The redemption amount of the 8% preferred stock is equal to the original
issuance price of $1,000 per share plus cumulative dividends that will have
accrued on a daily basis from the date of investment through the date of the
redemption at a rate of 8% per annum, compounded annually, together with a
liquidation participation amount. The liquidation participation amount is
calculated as if we were liquidated on the date of the redemption and the excess
of our assets over our liabilities (with the liabilities including, for purposes
of this calculation, the aggregate stated value of all outstanding shares of
preferred stock and all accrued and unpaid interest) were distributed on a share
for share basis among the holders of preferred stock and common stock. We expect
the redemption date to be within two business days after the consummation of
this offering.

The 8% promissory notes were issued at various times in 2002 and mature five
years and six months from the date of issuance, subject to mandatory prepayment
upon the occurrence of specified events, including the consummation of this
offering. Interest on the promissory notes, which is payable annually, accrues
at a rate of 8% per year.

Borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either the prime rate or
LIBOR plus 2.75% and are secured by substantially all of our assets. Borrowings
under the credit agreement are payable at the expiration of the agreement in
February 2005, subject to our compliance with a covenant that requires that we
have an uninterrupted 30-day period each year with no loans outstanding. There
were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of June 30, 2004
and October 12, 2004.

HCG Holdings LLC, our parent and the selling stockholder in this offering,
currently owns approximately 93% of our common stock and all of our outstanding
8% preferred stock and 8% promissory notes. HCG Holdings LLC is controlled by
Lake Capital Partners LP and Lake Capital Management LLC. The remaining equity
interests in HCG Holdings LLC are held by certain other institutional investors,
some of our executive officers and 24 of our other managing directors, three of
our board members and 31 other holders. Our executive officers and board members
holding interests in HCG Holdings LLC are Messrs. Holdren, Massaro, Burge,
Broadhurst and McCartney. If, as we expect, HCG Holdings LLC distributes to its
members all of the proceeds it receives from the sale of the 1,666,667 shares of
common stock being offered by it in this offering, the redemption of the 8%
preferred stock and the repayment of the 8% promissory notes, we estimate that
Messrs. Broadhurst, Burge, Holdren, Massaro and McCartney will receive a payment
of approximately $44,500, $44,500, $888,900, $88,900 and $44,500, respectively.

We will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this
offering that are not used to redeem the 8% preferred stock, repay our
outstanding 8% promissory notes and repay outstanding indebtedness, if any,
under our credit agreement. We intend to use the balance of our net proceeds for
general corporate purposes, including working capital. Should we determine to
employ cash resources for the acquisition of complementary businesses or
services, the amounts available for general corporate purposes may be
significantly reduced. Although we evaluate potential acquisitions in the
ordinary course of business, we have no specific understandings, commitments or
agreements with respect to any acquisition or investment at this time.

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes,
we intend to invest the funds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a
favorable return."

the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

 

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, raise additional equity capital and facilitate future access to
public markets. We intend to use approximately $1.5 million of our net proceeds
from this offering to repay amounts owed under our equipment advance facility.
As of June 30, 2004, the outstanding balance under this facility was $1.5
million, with an interest rate on our borrowings of 5.0% and with maturity dates
through 2007. We also intend to use $765,000 of our net proceeds from this
offering as the second installment of the purchase price to be paid to the
University of Michigan for the purchase of a fully paid, royalty free,
irrevocable and worldwide license from the University of Michigan. See
“Business—Intellectual Property Rights.” In addition, we intend to use
approximately $306,000 of our net proceeds from this offering to reimburse the
selling stockholders for discounts and commissions to underwriters payable by
the selling stockholders. We intend to use the balance of our net proceeds from
this offering to support our continued growth, including:

 

    • sales and marketing activities, such as increased sales and marketing       
      personnel, as well as field service personnel;                              


 

    • research and development, including clinical studies and regulatory

    • capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business, including          
      manufacturing, equipment and information technology;

  • working capital and other general corporate purposes.


 

In addition, we may use a portion of our net proceeds from this offering to
acquire or invest in businesses, products, services or technologies
complementary to our current business, through mergers, acquisitions, joint
ventures or otherwise. However, we have no specific agreements or commitments at
present and are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to these
transactions. Accordingly, our management will retain broad discretion as to the
allocation of our net proceeds from this offering.

 

Prior to their use, we intend to invest our net proceeds from this offering in
short-term, high-grade interest-bearing marketable securities, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. We believe
that our current cash and cash equivalents, excluding our net proceeds from this
offering, together with our marketable securities, cash expected to be generated
from sales of our product offering and our ability to draw down on our secured
revolving line of credit and equipment advance facility, will be sufficient to
meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months."

underwriting discounts and other estimated expenses, will be approximately
$119.4 million, or $137.9 million if the underwriters exercise their
overallotment option in full.

 

As of June 26, 2004, we had $200.0 million outstanding under our 10.25% senior
notes due 2014. The notes mature on March 15, 2014 and require semi-annual
interest payments. We used the net proceeds from our offering of the notes to
repay certain term loans, to pay expenses incurred in connection with the
offering of the notes and the amendment to our senior credit facility and for
general corporate purposes. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds of this
offering to repay $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding
senior notes plus an additional $7.2 million of prepayment penalties.

 

We expect to use the remaining proceeds of this offering, together with $45.8
million of our cash on hand, to distribute $88.0 million to our members and
former member equity holders for certain outstanding membership interests and
patronage equity either in redemption of patronage equity immediately prior to
the conversion or in connection with the conversion immediately after the
closing of this offering. As a result, we expect to experience a net cash
decrease of $45.8 million after giving effect to this offering and the
conversion. If the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, we
expect to distribute an estimated additional $19.8 million to our members and
former member equity holders in connection with the conversion and reduce the
number of shares of our common stock distributed to them by 1,800,000 shares."

common stock in this offering, at an offering price of $12.00 per share, will be
approximately $153.7 million ($177.6 million if the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional shares is exercised in full), after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

 

We will contribute the net proceeds of this offering to our operating
partnership. We will use the net proceeds to consummate the acquisitions
described in this prospectus, to repay indebtedness, redeem preferred equity
interests, and to increase our capital base to support the expansion of our
business including property acquisitions and development activities. The net
proceeds will be used to:

    •   acquire a 25% interest in Reflections I and Reflections II, two of the     
        properties that we asset manage for the separate account of CalSTRS, for a 
        total of $11.8 million and increase our indirect ownership interest in ARCO
        Plaza from 4.3% to 21.3% for a payment of $23.0 million;                   

    •   acquire the 50% interest in One Commerce Square owned by an unaffiliated   
        third party for a purchase price of $24.2 million, plus the assumption of  
        approximately $9.7 million representing the unaffiliated third party’s     
        share of debt principal and interest repayment obligations;                

    •   repay aggregate indebtedness of $10.7 million relating to One Commerce     
        Square, including principal bearing interest at the EuroRate plus 50 basis 
        points with a maturity date of April 15, 2005, and accrued deferred        
        interest on a $9.2 million mezzanine loan bearing interest at 17.5% with a 
        maturity date of March 16, 2011; redeem preferred equity interests related 
        to One Commerce Square held by an unaffiliated mezzanine debt lender on the
        property, which is entitled to an annual preferred return of 17.5% with no 
        stated maturity date, for $11.4 million; and fund a required reserve of    
        $4.2 million;                                                              

    •   repay principal of $9.2 million on the mezzanine loan on One Commerce      
        Square when this loan becomes prepayable in March 2005, or earlier with the
        consent of the lender;                                                     

    •   fund development costs associated with our development properties estimated
        to be approximately $25 million through the end of 2005; and               

    •   the remaining $34.2 million of the net proceeds will be used to partially  
        fund our co-investment obligation to our joint venture with CalSTRS or for 
        other future property acquisitions.                                        

The purchase prices for Reflections I, Reflections II and ARCO Plaza are subject
to adjustments for customary prorations and closing costs or credits. The
purchase price for the additional interest in ARCO Plaza will also be adjusted
downward for the increase in the outstanding debt associated with ARCO Plaza
resulting from the refinancing that occurred in July and August 2004, which was
subsequent to the agreement on the purchase price for this property interest. We
estimate that this downward adjustment and closing costs or credits will not
result in a material change to the purchase price we will pay CalSTRS for the
interests in these three properties or the use of proceeds as described above.
The amount and timing of our obligation to fund our co-investment commitment to
our joint venture with CalSTRS will depend upon our ability to identify
acquisition and other investment opportunities that are acceptable to both
CalSTRS and our company. In addition, the incurring of costs associated with our
development projects is subject to change due to market conditions.  Pending
the use of these funds for these purposes, we may use these amounts for general
corporate and working capital purposes."

        Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation will retain up to 50.0% of the net
stock offering proceeds from which the loan will be made to the employee stock
ownership plan, and will 
invest the remaining proceeds in Atlantic Coast Federal. The portion of the net
proceeds used by Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation to make a loan to the
employee stock ownership plan will enable the employee stock ownership plan to
purchase up to 8.0% of the shares of common stock sold in the stock offering.
Based upon the sale of 3,740,000 shares of common stock and 5,060,000 shares of
common stock at the minimum and maximum of the estimated offering range,
respectively, the loan to the employee stock ownership plan would be $2.99
million and $4.05 million, respectively. The remaining net proceeds initially retained 
by Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation may be used for general business purposes and to
invest in U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various maturities,
mortgage-backed or other securities, deposits in either Atlantic Coast Federal
or other financial institutions, or a combination thereof. The net proceeds may
ultimately be used to support Atlantic Coast Federal's lending activities and
any future expansion of operations, although no specific acquisition
transactions are being considered at this time.

        The net proceeds from the stock offering may also be used for other
business and investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special
cash dividends, possible repurchases of the common stock or returns of capital,
subject to applicable regulatory limitations. Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation
and Atlantic Coast Federal have no current plans, however, to declare or pay any
return of capital on the common stock. Management of Atlantic Coast Federal
Corporation may consider expanding or diversifying its activities, as
opportunities become available.

        In the future, the board of directors of Atlantic Coast Federal
Corporation may determine, based on the existing facts and circumstances, to
repurchase shares of common stock, subject to any applicable regulatory
requirements. Repurchases of stock by Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, which
may be at prices above or below the initial offering price, will generally be
conducted through an open market repurchase program subject to applicable
regulations. Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of
Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation's board of directors that Atlantic Coast
Federal will be capitalized in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements
after any such repurchases. Such facts and circumstances may include, but will
not be limited to:

        o       Market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock
                is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the
                attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the
                rate of return and risk involved in the investment, the ability
                to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the
                remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in Atlantic
                Coast Federal Corporation's return on equity;

        o       The avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue
                additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to
                fund employee stock benefit plans; and

        o       Any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the
                best interests of Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation and its
                stockholders.

        The portion of the net proceeds used by Atlantic Coast Federal
Corporation to invest in Atlantic Coast Federal will be added to Atlantic Coast
Federal's general funds to be used for general corporate purposes, including
increased lending activities. While the amount of net 
proceeds received by Atlantic Coast Federal will further strengthen its capital
position, which already exceeds all regulatory requirements, the stock offering
is not planned solely to increase Atlantic Coast Federal's regulatory capital.
The net proceeds may be used as described above to support lending activities as
well as future expansion of operations, although no specific acquisitions are
being considered at this time.

        The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the stock offering
may be more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the
number of shares to be sold in the stock offering is adjusted to reflect a
change in the estimated pro forma market value of Atlantic Coast Federal.
Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at
Atlantic Coast Federal will not result in the receipt of new funds for
investment by Atlantic Coast Federal but will result in a reduction of Atlantic
Coast Federal's interest expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from
interest-bearing certificates or other deposit accounts."

        The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the
offering may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would
increase if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common
stock not purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering.
Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will
not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but will result in a
reduction of Putnam Savings Bank's deposits. In all instances, Putnam Savings
Bank will receive at least 50% of the net proceeds of the offering.

        We are undertaking the offering at this time in order to increase our
capital and have the capital resources available to expand and diversify our
business. For further information, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Strategy."" The offering
proceeds will increase our capital resources and the amount of funds available
to us for lending and investment purposes. The proceeds will also give us
greater flexibility to diversify operations and expand the products and services
we offer to our customers.

PSB Holdings, Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the offering:

        º to finance the purchase of common stock in the offering by our
          employee stock ownership plan;

        º to invest in securities;

        º to repurchase its shares of common stock;

        º to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches and
          other financial services businesses, although no specific transactions
          are being considered at this time; and

        º for general corporate purposes.

        Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not
repurchase shares of our common stock during the first year following the
offering, except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior
regulatory approval. The loan that will be used to fund the purchases by the
employee stock ownership plan will accrue interest.

Putnam Savings Bank may use the proceeds it receives from the offering:

        º to fund new loans;

        º to support an expanding base of customers, products and services;

        º to invest in securities;

        º to expand its retail banking franchise by establishing or acquiring
          new branches or by acquiring other financial institutions, or other
          financial services companies, or their assets, although no
          transactions are being considered at this time; and

        º for general corporate purposes.

        The use of the proceeds outlined above may change, based on changes in
interest rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial
services industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall
market conditions."

stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and
other estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately
$100.2 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of
Class A common stock offered by any selling stockholder. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering as follows:

    
        º approximately $65.8 million will be used to repay outstanding
          borrowings under our credit facility, including accrued interest
          thereon; and

  
        º approximately $30.4 million will be used to fund a payment to our
          current equity holders of Texas Roadhouse Holdings LLC equal to their
          undistributed share of Texas Roadhouse Holdings LLC's income for
          periods through June 29, 2004 and additional funds will be used to

          to the effective date of the combination of our operations under Texas
          Roadhouse, Inc., which we estimate will be approximately $4.0 million.

        We entered into a $100.0 million credit facility with Bank of
America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Banc of America Securities LLC, as
Co-Lead Arranger, and other lender parties on July 16, 2003. Banc of America
Securities LLC is one of the underwriters in this offering, and Bank of
America, N.A. is an affiliate of Banc of America Securities LLC. Loans under
this facility bear interest at either: a base rate, which is the higher of the
Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, or Bank of America's publicly announced variable
prime rate; or a rate based on the Eurodollar rate, plus a margin of 1.50% to
2.50% for borrowings under the revolving credit portion of the facility or 1.75%
to 2.75% for borrowings under the term loan portion of the facility. Loans under
this facility mature on July 16, 2006. As of June 29, 2004, $60.5 million was
outstanding under this facility. This indebtedness was incurred primarily to
refinance existing indebtedness and to finance the construction of new
restaurants.

6,150,000 shares of common stock in this offering to be approximately
$89.0 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters' overallotment option is
exercised in full, we estimate the net proceeds will be approximately
$102.7 million.

              The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our
capitalization and financial flexibility, to provide a public market for our
common stock and to facilitate access to public capital markets.

              We presently expect to use the net proceeds of this offering, and
approximately $10 million to $20 million of our existing cash and cash
equivalents, to fund Phase 3 clinical trials of telavancin. We initiated the
first of these trials in September 2004.

              This expected use of the net proceeds of this offering represents
our current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors,
including the ongoing status and results of the Phase 3 telavancin clinical
trials and our ability to enter into a partnership with a pharmaceutical company
regarding telavancin, which could result in some or all of the clinical trial
costs for the telavancin program being paid by such partner.

              If we enter into a partnership with a pharmaceutical company
regarding telavancin that results in some or all of the Phase 3 telavancin
clinical trial costs being paid by such partner, we may use a portion of the net
proceeds for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies that we
believe are complementary to our own, though we have no agreements or
understandings with respect to any acquisition at this time. Pending the
application of the net proceeds of the offering as described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities until they are used."

approximately $34.5 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the
net proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling stockholders.

   •  to finance estimated costs of $8.0 to $10.0 million in 2004 and $2.0 to     
      $4.0 million in 2005 to expand the capacity of our current operations by    
      establishing new outsourcing centers in the Philippines or other offshore

expand our operations into any other country. The amounts and timing of any
expenditure will vary depending on the amount of cash generated by our
operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth,
if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant
flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the uses
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in

•   to invest in securities;         
                                       
•   to pay dividends to stockholders;


•   to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to regulatory restrictions;


 •   to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions or    
     other businesses that are related to banking; and                   


•   for general corporate purposes.


     Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not
repurchase shares of our common stock during the first year following the
reorganization, except to fund stock-based benefit plans or, with prior
regulatory approval, when extraordinary circumstances exist.

     Naugatuck Valley Savings and Loan may use the proceeds that it receives
from the offering, which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed
to Naugatuck Valley Savings and Loan:

•   to fund new loans;


•   to invest in securities;


 •   to finance the possible expansion of its business activities,      
     including developing or acquiring new branch locations; and        


•   for general corporate purposes.


     We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed
above. We currently have no specific plans or agreements regarding any expansion
activities or acquisitions other than the branch office openings and relocations
that are already underway, are subject
to regulatory approval and financing for which is not contingent on this
offering.

     We do not have any other specific plans for the investment of the proceeds
of this offering."

placement will be approximately $773.4 million, based on (1) the sale of
13,500,000 shares of our common stock at the public offering price of $58.00 per
share, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses
of approximately $3.5 million payable by us and (2) the concurrent private
placement of 636,885 shares of our common stock to Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
Group at a per share price equal to the public offering price less the
underwriting discount. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase up to an additional 2,025,000 shares of our common stock in this
offering, our net proceeds will be approximately $884.7 million. We intend to
use the net proceeds we receive from this offering and the concurrent private
placement for general working capital purposes, substantially all of which will
be used to build a portfolio of self-originated mortgage loans and, if necessary
to maintain our REIT status, to purchase mortgage-related assets from third
parties.

 

We may need a significant amount of time to fully invest the available net
proceeds we receive from this offering and the concurrent private placement in
our intended investments and to implement fully our leveraging strategy to
increase the total amount of our investments to our desired level. Initially, we
may invest a portion of our net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement in interest-bearing, short-term, investment grade securities
that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. We will not
leverage our temporary investment in these securities. We expect these temporary
investments to provide a lower net return than we hope to achieve from our
long-term intended use of the net proceeds we receive from this offering and the
concurrent private placement."

  † the balance to fund other general corporate and working capital purposes.


 

Since the consideration for our initial hotels is fixed, the value of the
operating partnership units that we will receive in exchange for our
contribution of the net proceeds to the operating partnership will increase or
decrease if our common stock price increases or decreases.

Each of the agreements to acquire the initial hotels is subject to customary
closing conditions to a buyer’s performance. As a result, we cannot provide any
assurances that we will elect not to close one or more of the acquisitions. In
the event that we do not close the acquisition of one or more of the initial
hotels, the offering proceeds allocated to these acquisitions will be available
to fund future lodging-related investments and for general corporate and working
capital purposes.

(1) As of June 30, 2004, the hotels’ collective cash was             
    approximately $13.8 million.                                     


 

(2) The cash portion of the acquisition cost for the entities that   
    own the initial hotels consists of $50.0 million plus an amount  
    equal to the hotels’ collective net working capital as of the    
    closing. As of June 30, 2004, such collective net working capital
    was approximately $11.2 million. The amount equal to the hotels’ 
    collective net working capital as of the closing may be higher or
    lower than the amount as of June 30, 2004, depending upon the    
    hotels’ collective net working capital balance on the date of    
    closing.                                                         


 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing,
short-term investment grade securities or money-market accounts which are
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. Such investments may
include, for example, government and government agency certificates,

create a public market for our common stock, facilitate our future access to the
public capital markets and increase our visibility in our markets. We intend to
use the net proceeds to repay the then outstanding balance under our bank
borrowings, and to use the remainder for general corporate purposes, including
working capital. As of September 30, 2004, our outstanding bank borrowings were
$2.3 million, all of which were under our capital expenditure term loans. Our
term loans are required to be repaid in monthly installments through June 2006
and bear an annual interest rate at the bank’s prime interest rate plus from
0.5% to 1.0%, but not less than 4.5% (an actual rate of 5.25% to 5.75% at
September 30, 2004) and will expire in June 2006. We do not have more specific
plans for the net proceeds from this offering. We may also use a portion of the
net proceeds to acquire businesses, products and technologies that we believe
will complement our business. We are not currently engaged in any negotiations
for any acquisitions.

We have not yet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and therefore
cannot estimate the amounts to be used for all of the purposes discussed above.
The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of

----------
(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
      received from Messrs. Cheung, Li and Preissler described below. These
      funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed
      in trust upon consummation of this offering.

      $15,300,000, or $17,595,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business or
to effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of directors at that
time.

      The payment to BZB Leasing of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. None of our initial stockholders, including our officers and directors,
has any affiliation with BZB Leasing. Upon completion of a business combination,
we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

      We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $80,000 or
$242,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for director and
officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $40,000) with the balance of
$40,000, or $202,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, being
held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as
well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

      To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

      Each of Chih T. Cheung, our chairman, James Z. Li, our chief executive
officer and secretary, and James Preissler, our chief financial officer, has
advanced to us a total of $23,333.33, aggregating a total of $70,000, which was
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and
expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of June 14,
2005 or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

      The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

      We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

      Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the
consummation of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay BZB Leasing
the fee described above. None of our initial stockholders, including our
officers and directors, has any affiliation with BZB Leasing. No compensation of
any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our
existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination.
However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

      A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust fund."

offerings of IDSs at a price to the public of $13.64 per IDS and third party
notes at 100% of their principal amount and the use of the proceeds to effect
the Transactions, assuming the offerings closed on September 30, 2004. The
estimates below do not take into account any exercise by the underwriters of
their overallotment option. Actual amounts will vary from the estimates shown
below.

      We will use the proceeds from the offerings, net of underwriting discounts
and our fees and expenses, as follows: (i) we will lend approximately
$79.6 million to Coinmach Corp., to be evidenced by the intercompany note and
(ii) we will make a capital contribution to Coinmach Corp. through Laundry Corp.
of approximately $165.5 million.

      Coinmach Corp. will use part of the proceeds received by it to: (i) redeem
a portion of the Coinmach Corp. 9% notes in the aggregate principal amount of
approximately $125.5 million (plus approximately $2.8 million of accrued
interest and approximately $11.3 million of related redemption premium) and
(ii) repay approximately $15.5 million of outstanding term loans under the
Coinmach Corp. credit facility.

      Coinmach Corp. will distribute approximately $90.0 million, consisting of
a portion of the proceeds received by it, to Laundry Corp., which will use such
amounts to redeem approximately $90.0 million of its outstanding Class A
preferred stock (representing all of its outstanding Class A preferred stock).
At the time of such redemption, our officers, directors and certain holders of
5% or more of Holdings units will own substantially all of the Laundry Corp.
preferred stock to be redeemed, and therefore will receive substantially all of
the proceeds used for the redemption. If the underwriters’ overallotment option
is exercised in full, we expect to redeem an additional $35.3 million of Laundry
Corp. preferred stock held by such persons.

approximately $141.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and other offering-related expenses. We will use our net proceeds
from this offering, together with our $537.3 million of borrowings under the new
credit facilities (plus an additional $0.4 million under the new revolving
credit facility if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
and $3.6 million of cash on hand, as follows:

    †    $565.5 million to repay in full our indebtedness under our existing credit
         facility, which amount is equal to the $615.5 million of term debt that   
         will be outstanding under our existing credit facility when this offering 
         closes, less $50.0 million of subordinated capital certificates previously
         issued to us by the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative which will be     
         redeemed upon such repayment;                                             

    †    $23.8 million to pay fees and expenses associated with the repayment of   
         the existing credit facility and the establishment of the new credit      
         facilities;

         to us by the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative in connection with our   
         borrowing under Term Loans C and D;                                       

    †    $68.0 million to repay in full our indebtedness of $66.0 million and an   
         associated redemption premium of $2.0 million under the 2007 term notes;  

    †    $7.4 million to pay interest that we estimate will have accrued on the    
         existing credit facility and the 2007 term notes through the closing date 
         of this offering; and                                                     

    †    $9.6 million associated with our redemption following the closing of this 
         offering of a portion of outstanding options to purchase shares of common 
         stock held by management and other employees ($10.0 million if the        
         underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full).            

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the existing equity investors’ sale
of 10,848,055 shares of common stock in the offering, nor will we receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares by our existing equity investors pursuant to
the option they have granted the underwriters to purchase from them up to
2,866,682 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments. However, if this
over-allotment option is exercised, we will use up to $0.4 million of additional
borrowing under the new revolving credit facility to redeem additional options
held by management and other employees. See “Management—Stock Incentive Plan.”

The term debt under our existing credit facility consists of a Tranche A term
loan and a Tranche B term loan. The Tranche A term loan balance of $115.5
million at September 30, 2004 bears interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus 3%
(4.75% at September 30, 2004). The Tranche A term loan is scheduled to mature on
March 31, 2007. The annual interest rate on $475.0 million of borrowings under
our Tranche B term loan is 8.85% through August 2005 and variable thereafter,
and the annual interest rate on the remaining $25.0 million of borrowings under
our Tranche B term loan is variable (6.4% at September 30, 2004). The Tranche B
term loan is scheduled to mature on March 31, 2015. We had $3.0 million of
borrowings at September 30, 2004, and currently have no borrowings under our
existing revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in June 2005.

The 2007 term notes bear interest at a floating rate per annum, reset quarterly,
equal to LIBOR plus 925 basis points (with LIBOR deemed never less than 1.5%),
and are scheduled to mature on March 26, 2007. The 2007 term notes currently
bear interest at 11.23%. We used the $66.0 million of proceeds from the sale of
the 2007 term notes, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of our old
preferred stock on March 26, 2004."

approximately $61.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

    The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, reduce indebtedness, obtain additional equity capital, facilitate
future access to capital, and expand our business. We currently intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering to extinguish all outstanding principal and
accrued interest under our credit facilities, which totaled $46.7 million as of
September 30, 2004. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds to recruit and
train additional staff and to secure new office space in order to execute our
strategy of expanding our therapeutic expertise and our service offerings and
broadening our geographic reach in South America and Asia. This may be
accomplished through acquisitions from time to time as opportunities arise. We
will use any balance for general corporate purposes. Prior to the deployment of
the net proceeds after repayment of our credit facilities, we intend to place
these proceeds in short term interest-bearing investment grade securities.

    We currently have a pending understanding with respect to a particular
acquisition that would not, if consummated, require financial statements
reflecting the acquisition to be included in this prospectus. Management will
have broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds remaining after the
repayment of debt under our credit facilities.

    Our credit facilities consist of a term loan A facility, term loan B
facility, and a revolving facility. The applicable interest rate under the
credit facilities for all borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2004 was
4.8% per year. Principal payments on the credit facilities began on March 31,
2004 and are required to be completed by December 31, 2009."

stock in this offering and the concurrent private placement will be
approximately $119.5 million, based on (1) the sale of 12,700,000 shares of our
common stock at the initial public offering price, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, and (2)
the concurrent private placement of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to FBR
at a price per share equal to the offering price, less an amount equal to the
underwriting discounts and commissions. If the over-allotment option is
exercised in full, we will receive additional net proceeds of approximately
$16.8 million.

    We expect to use approximately $53 million of our net proceeds of this
offering and the concurrent private placement for the Acquisition.

    We expect to use most of the remaining proceeds to make capital
contributions to our operating subsidiary, so that these contributions, together
with the statutory capital and surplus resulting from the Acquisition, will
equal approximately $100 million. In addition, we expect to retain approximately
$9.0 million of the proceeds to pay our corporate expenses.

    We will have broad discretion over the manner in which we apply the
remaining net proceeds. Currently, other than the Acquisition, we do not have
any acquisitions or investments pending. During the initial six to nine months
after the completion of this offering as we commence our operations and hire
underwriting officers, underwriters, claim adjusters and other personnel, we
will have limited operating income. Consequently, a portion of the net proceeds
allocated to our subsidiary will be used to fund the costs required to commence
our operations, including costs incurred to establish offices in Chicago,
develop new policy forms and rate schedules, and complete regulatory filings."

million from our sale of 6,500,000 shares of common stock in this offering,
after deducting estimated offering expenses and the underwriting discount of
approximately $14.6 million. The selling stockholders will receive aggregate net
proceeds of approximately $17.7 million after deducting the underwriting
discount of approximately $1.3 million. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, the selling stockholders will receive an
additional $19.9 million in net proceeds after deducting approximately $1.5
million of underwriting discounts and commissions. We will not receive any
portion of the net proceeds received by the selling stockholders from the sale
of their shares.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, to facilitate our future access to the public capital markets and
to provide us with flexibility in the future, including the flexibility to
acquire additional businesses, products or technologies either with the net
proceeds from this offering or through the publicly traded common stock we
create through this offering. We presently have no intention to acquire any such
businesses, products or technologies. We intend to use the net proceeds of this
offering to repay indebtedness in the aggregate amount of $10.6 million, pay
$10.1 million of accrued and unpaid dividends on shares of our preferred stock
and cover general corporate purposes, including working capital. Pending use of
the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the funds in short-term,
interest bearing, investment grade securities. We currently have a line of
credit and term loan facility with Comerica Bank which consists of a $15.0
million revolving line of credit, which line of credit will increase to $25.0
million upon the completion of this offering, and a $5.0 million term loan. This
facility is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets. Our
revolving line of credit matures on December 2, 2005 and accrues interest at the
London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.75%. Our term loan matures on
August 7, 2008 and accrues interest at LIBOR plus 3.0%.

Management’s plans for the net proceeds of this offering may vary significantly
depending on a number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, and
cash flow. We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for the net
proceeds to be received upon completion of this offering. Accordingly, our
management team will have broad discretion in using the net proceeds of this
offering."

corporate purposes, such as working capital and business expansion. Accordingly,

These amounts are based on the accreted value of the senior discount notes as of

proceeds we actually receive from the sale of such shares.

Nalco LLC has informed us that it intends to use the proceeds from this offering
that it receives from us to redeem units of Nalco LLC held by the Sponsors on a
pro rata basis, based on their current ownership levels. 

The proceeds received by our subsidiary, Nalco Company, from the offering of
senior notes and senior subordinated notes were used, together with related
financings described elsewhere in this prospectus, to finance the Acquisition
and to pay related transaction fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transactions. One of our subsidiaries used the proceeds from the senior discount
notes offering to make a return of capital distribution of approximately $446.9

discounts but before estimated offering expenses. Our estimates assume no
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. We anticipate using the net
proceeds of this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, to:

        º redeem, for approximately $78.1 million, all of our outstanding
          redeemable preferred units from CSFB Private Equity and EnCap
          Investments, including accrued distributions;

        º repay approximately $7.0 million of Copano Processing's term loan that
          is not being refinanced under its new revolving credit facility;

        º repay approximately $6.0 million of the indebtedness outstanding under
          Copano Pipelines' revolving credit facility;

        º repay approximately $1.0 million of other obligations; and

        º pay remaining offering expenses, currently estimated to be
          approximately $0.9 million.


    As of June 30, 2004, Copano Processing had approximately $16.0 million
outstanding under its term loan bearing interest at a rate of 14%. A portion of
the debt outstanding under this term loan was incurred to fund a portion of the
purchase price of our Houston Central Processing Plant and the Sheridan NGL
pipeline. The remainder of the debt outstanding under Copano Processing's term
loan was incurred as a result of a payment-in-kind interest provision in the
credit agreement. Concurrently with this offering, Copano Processing will
refinance the portion of its term loan that is not repaid from the proceeds of
this offering with a new revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2004, Copano
Pipelines had approximately $55.0 million outstanding under its revolving credit
facility with a weighted average interest rate of 4.42%. All of the debt
outstanding under this revolving credit facility was incurred to retire existing
debt, finance capital expenditures (including construction and expansion
projects), finance acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates and
meet working capital requirements.

    In May 1996, we purchased gathering pipelines and related assets in South
Texas for $6.0 million, of which $4.8 million was paid in cash and $1.2 million
was payable without interest based upon volumes of gas transported through the
purchased gathering system. As of June 30, 2004, the remaining payment
obligation totaled $972,000. The remaining balance is due on the earlier of:
(1) May 2006, (2) the sale of the purchased gathering system or (3) the date on
which we effect an initial public offering of our equity securities. We expect
to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding
balance of this obligation.

    We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment option to redeem a number of common units, on a pro rata basis,
from CSFB Private Equity and EnCap Investments equal to the number of common
units issued upon the exercise of the over-allotment option. If the
over-allotment option is exercised in full, CSFB Private Equity's and EnCap
Investments' ownership of common units will each be reduced from 605,560 common
units to 230,560 common units. The number of subordinated units held by CSFB
Private Equity and EnCap Investments will remain unchanged.

pursuant to a special dividend. Under Bermuda law, such a dividend would require
the approval by shareholders of a resolution reducing our share premium account
by the amount of the special dividend and transferring that amount to our
contributed surplus account."

our common stock in this offering of $47.1 million, at an initial public
offering price of $11.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses.

    We presently intend to use a portion of the proceeds for general corporate
purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We also believe
opportunities may exist to expand our current business through strategic
alliances and select acquisitions, and we may utilize a portion of the proceeds
for such purposes, although we have no current agreements, commitments or
discussions pending with respect to any material transactions of this type.

    Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, marketable securities."

approximately $271.7 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, our net proceeds will be
approximately $313.2 million after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We will use $126.9 million in the aggregate, or 46.7% of the anticipated net
proceeds, to pay cash amounts due to stockholders of Aames Financial in
connection with the Aames Financial/Newco merger described under “Our Structure
and Formation Transactions.” The cash portion of the merger consideration to be
paid from the net proceeds to Specialty Finance Partners, Aames Financial’s
largest stockholder, in exchange for its shares of Aames Financial stock will be
$118.9 million.

We expect to use the remaining net proceeds for general purposes, including the
origination and financing of mortgage loans.

A tabular presentation of our estimated use of proceeds that we will receive in
this offering, assuming that the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not
exercised, follows:

In addition, concurrently with the closing of this offering, an affiliate of
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc., our sole book-running manager, is
expected to purchase 5.0 million shares of our common stock at a price equal to
the public offering price in this offering less the underwriting discount. These
shares are not being registered as part of this offering and will be restricted
securities. The net proceeds of the concurrent private placement will be
approximately $39.5 million. We expect to use the net proceeds from the
concurrent private placement in the same manner as the remaining net proceeds of
the initial public offering.

After this offering, Aames Financial will also use its own funds to redeem its
$64.4 million of outstanding convertible subordinated debentures.

We currently have a swap derivative agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston
International, an affiliate of Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, one of our
co-managing underwriters, through which we purchase derivative securities to
hedge against interest rate fluctuations. In implementing our hedging strategy
going forward, it is possible that we could use a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering to purchase derivative securities from Credit Suisse First
Boston International under our swap derivative agreement."

share offering price of $7.50 from the sale of 9,500,000 shares of our common
stock in this offering. The total net proceeds would be approximately
$76.2 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full.
“Net proceeds” is what we expect to receive after paying the underwriting
discounts and commissions and other expenses of the offering.

    We intend to use the proceeds from this offering primarily to accelerate and
fund our exploration and development activities, in the following approximate
amounts:

    • the Atlantic Rim project in the Washakie Basin: $13.6 million

    • the Pacific Rim project in the Washakie Basin: $13.1 million

    • the Wilmington unit in the Los Angeles Basin: $18.4 million

    • the Powder River Basin: $1.4 million.

    The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate
purposes and working capital. Pending these uses, we plan to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing short-term investment grade securities.

    The foregoing discussion represents our best estimate of the allocation of
the net proceeds of the offering based upon our current plans. Actual
expenditures may vary from these estimates and we may find it necessary or
advisable to reallocate the net proceeds within the above-described categories
or to use portions thereof for other purposes."

common stock pursuant to this prospectus, after deducting the underwriting
discount and estimated offering costs and expenses, will be approximately $54.6
million. If the underwriter’s over-allotment is exercised in full, our net
proceeds from the offering will be approximately $63.0 million. We will
contribute the net proceeds to our operating partnership. Our operating
partnership intends to subsequently use the net proceeds as follows:

    •  approximately $25.0 million to repay the outstanding indebtedness on three

    •  approximately $4.1 million to fund renovation and pay closing costs and    
       $1.8 million to fund the cash portion of the purchase of the Hilton        
       Philadelphia Airport;                                                      

    •  approximately $0.5 million to fund renovations at the Holiday Inn Downtown

       interests in the resort property;                                          

    •  $2.0 million to MHI Hotels Services in consideration of the amendment and  
       restructuring of existing management agreements relating to five of our    
       initial hotel properties; and

Each of the agreements to acquire the initial properties is subject to customary
closing conditions. As a result, we cannot provide any assurances that we will
complete the acquisitions. In the event that we do not complete the acquisition
of one or more of the initial properties, the offering proceeds allocated to
these acquisitions will be available to fund future Upper Upscale, Upscale and
Midscale lodging-related investments and for general corporate and working
capital purposes.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing,
short-term investment grade securities or money-market accounts that are
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. Such investments may
include, for example, government and government agency certificates,
certificates of deposit, interest-bearing bank deposits and mortgage loan
participations."

        º approximately $19.2 million will be used to repay all of the
          outstanding subordinated debt we issued to repurchase some of our
          common stock, which we refer to as the stock repurchase subordinated
          debt, approximately $16.4 million of which matures on October 15, 2007
          and bears interest at an annual interest rate of 13% and approximately
          $2.8 million of which matures upon settlement of certain liabilities
          retained by the sellers of the National Cash Advance group of
          affiliated companies to us and bears interest at an annual interest
          rate of 13%; and

        º approximately $18.5 million will be used to repay all of the
          outstanding subordinated debt we issued to our stockholders from time
          to time, which we refer to as the notes payable to stockholders, which
          mature on October 15, 2007 and bear interest at annual interest rate
          of 13%.

    We intend to use any remaining net proceeds we receive to repay additional
borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2004, we had
approximately $160.3 million of borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit
facility and approximately $5.4 million of letters of credit outstanding,
leaving approximately $99.3 million available for future borrowings. As of
September 30, 2004, after giving pro forma effect to (1) $15.4 million of
additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility to repay subordinated
debt that matured on October 15, 2004, (2) approximately $465,000 of additional
borrowings under this facility to make payments to state taxing authorities for
certain estimated taxes owed by our existing stockholders on our income through
September 30, 2004 and (3) the repayment of approximately $125.6 million of
borrowings under this facility with net proceeds that we receive from this
offering, approximately $209.0 million would have been available for future
borrowings under this facility. Any portion of our revolving credit facility
that is repaid may be borrowed again in the future.

this offering will be approximately $66.9 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $17.50 per share and after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common
stock by the selling stockholders. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option, we will not receive any additional proceeds. We intend to
use the net proceeds to:

      †   redeem all outstanding shares of our series B preferred stock and series 
          B-1 preferred stock for approximately $15.2 million;

In addition, we may also use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of,
or investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement
our business. However, we have no present understandings, commitments or
agreements to enter into any potential acquisitions or investments.


The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the increased usage of our exchange, the growth in the number
of members of our exchange, the timing of our establishment of additional EDPs
in various locations around the world, the dates on which we further upgrade our
systems and expand the products and services available to members of our
exchange, our capital costs, developments in domestic and foreign government
regulation of the communications services industry, the amount of proceeds
actually raised in this offering, the amount of cash generated by our operations
and the extent of competition we face. As a result, our management will have
broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this offering. Pending
utilization of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of the offering in short-term investment grade and U.S. government
securities."

In September 2004, we entered into a binding agreement to acquire Colonie
Center, a regional mall located in the Albany, New York area for a base purchase
price of $84.2 million. The agreement, which is subject to customary closing
conditions, provides for an increase to the purchase price, if, prior to June
30, 2005, certain pending leases in negotiation are executed and tenants under
such leases take occupancy and commence rental payments. The maximum amount of
such purchase price increase is approximately $9 million so that the maximum
purchase price is $93.2 million. In addition, we plan to invest an additional
$9.6 million in the renovation and repositioning plan for Colonie Center for a
maximum total project cost of $102.8 million. We expect to finance the
acquisition out of the net proceeds of this offering. We may elect to place
mortgage financing on the property and use the proceeds from such financing to
fund the renovation costs. We anticipate that this acquisition will close within
30 days following the closing of this offering. We believe that it is probable
that this transaction will be consummated; however, there can be no assurance
that this transaction will close.

Pending the use of any cash proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
interest-bearing, short-term investment grade securities or money-market
accounts which are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. Such
investments may include, for example, government and government agency
certificates, certificates of deposit, interest-bearing bank deposits and
mortgage loan participations.

Any net proceeds remaining after the uses set forth in the table above will be
used for working capital purposes and to acquire assets. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option for this offering in full, we expect to use
the additional net proceeds, which will be approximately $19.3 million, for
renovation of properties, property acquisitions and working capital needs."

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, we
estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $200.9 million. The
following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of funds for the
Transactions and assumes:

        º an offering of 13,500,000 shares at an offering price of $14.00 per

        º the retirement of our existing senior credit facility;

        º the establishment of a new senior credit facility;

          shareholders will receive an aggregate special cash dividend of
          $139.7 million; and

        º the payment of related transaction fees and expenses.

common shares to be sold by them in this offering. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of common shares by the selling shareholders.

of our business or the development of new products.

actual results may differ.

    The remaining net proceeds will be deposited into an escrow account
immediately upon the closing of this offering and will be disbursed to us one
business day following the closing of the Kanawha acquisition, which will occur
concurrently with the closing of this offering. We will have broad discretion

acquisitions pending.

Pounds Sterling. The U.S. dollar purchase prices in the table above are based on
£0.5199 per $1.00, the noon buying rate as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York on December 13, 2004. We have entered into option contracts to
purchase Pounds Sterling at a rate of not less than £0.5243 per $1.00 to protect
us from a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar to below this level between
now and the anticipated closing of the offering.

(1)  The purchase price of North America Capital, which owns Atlantic, is        
     approximately $114.4 million, increasing at a rate of 17% per year from     
     July 29, 2004, which was the date on which North America Capital closed the 
     acquisition of Executive Air Support, Inc., until the date on which we close
     the acquisition of North America Capital. For purposes of the table above,  
     we have assumed that the closing of our acquisition of North America Capital
     occurs on December 22, 2004, resulting in a total purchase price of         
     approximately $122.2 million.                                               
    
(2)  The purchase price of MDEH, which indirectly owns Thermal Chicago and       
     Northwind Aladdin, is approximately $59.5 million, increasing at a rate of  
     17% per year from June 30, 2004 on the equity contributed to MDEH to        
     consummate the acquisition of Thermal Chicago and 20% per year from         
     September 29, 2004 on the equity contributed to MDEH to consummate the      
     acquisition of Northwind Aladdin, until the date on which we close the      
     acquisition of MDEH. For the purposes of the table above, we have assumed   
     that the closing of our acquisition of MDEH occurs on December 22, 2004,    
     resulting in a total purchase price of approximately $64.1 million.         
    
(3)  The purchase price of Macquarie Yorkshire Limited, which owns 50% of CHL, is
     approximately £43.3 million, increased by £9,750 for each day the closing   
     occurs after September 30, 2004. For purposes of the table above, we have   
     assumed that the closing of our acquisition occurs on December 22, 2004 and 
     that the purchase price is therefore approximately £44.1 million            
     ($84.8 million). In addition, we intend to invest a further £1 million      
     ($1.9 million) in Macquarie Yorkshire Limited to enable it to replace a     
     letter of credit of the same amount required by a lender to a subsidiary of 
     CHL as security for future funding breakage costs on their fixed rate loan  
     to the subsidiary.                                                          
    
(4)  The purchase price of our interest in SEW is approximately £19.4 million,   
     increasing at a rate of 17% per year from April 30, 2004 until the date on  
     which the closing of our acquisition occurs, reduced by the amount of any   
     cash distributions received by the Macquarie Group from this interest over  
     this period. Assuming the closing of our acquisition occurs on December 22, 
     2004, the total purchase price would be approximately £20.7 million         
     ($39.8 million).                                                            
    
(5)  Macquarie Infrastructure Company Inc. anticipates contributing equity in the
     amount of up to $26 million to Atlantic to fund the acquisition of two      
     additional FBOs. This acquisition is expected to close after the date of    
     this offering. In the event that the acquisition by Atlantic closes prior to
     the completion of this offering, the purchase price of North America Capital
     will increase by the amount of the additional equity contributed to Atlantic
     by the Macquarie Group, increasing at a rate of 17% per year from the date  
     upon which North America Capital closes the acquisition of GAH until the    
     date of the closing of our acquisition of North America Capital, and no     
     capital contribution to Atlantic will be required by us.                    


     Pending application of the net proceeds to purchase our initial businesses
and investments as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in cash or U.S. government obligations. In the event that the
conditions in respect of the closing of any of our planned purchases of our
initial businesses and investments described in this prospectus are not met, we
intend to use the funds to buy other infrastructure businesses in accordance
with our acquisition strategy."

by us at the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$25.3 million. If the underwriters exercise their over allotment option in full,
we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $29.5 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, first, to repay any
outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. As of September 30, 2004, we
had outstanding borrowings of $2.5 million under our credit facility. Second, we
may use up to $1.2 million to pay outstanding liabilities of Opsys Limited if we
purchase that company pursuant to our transaction agreement, as amended by our
settlement agreement, with them. Third, we intend to use a majority of the net
proceeds of this offering to increase our working capital and to fund our
ongoing research and development efforts. We have no current plans for
significant increases in numbers of personnel or other operating expenses from
current levels, other than increased costs as a result of being a public
company. The balance of the net proceeds may be used for capital expenditures
and acquisitions of businesses, technology or other assets.

We expect to review this allocation of proceeds regularly following the offering
and to adjust the amounts allocated to each purpose accordingly. In making such
resource allocation decisions, we anticipate taking into account current revenue
levels, contracted future revenues, prospective future revenues and the
resources we will be required to expend in developing and promoting our
technology.

From time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses, technologies
or other assets, either directly or through joint ventures or other
arrangements. Although we have no agreements with respect to a material
acquisition at the present time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to
acquire businesses, technologies or other assets, including acquisitions with
respect to P-OLED materials businesses. Our management may apply the net
proceeds of this offering in ways that the stockholders may not deem desirable.
The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the growth of our business.

The principal purposes of this offering are as follows:

  •   to obtain additional capital;

  •   to create a public market for our common stock;

  •   to facilitate our future access to public equity markets;

  •   to provide liquidity for our existing stockholders;

    •   to improve the effectiveness of our stock option plans in attracting and   
        retaining key employees;                                                   

    •   to increase the visibility of our company in a marketplace in which several
        of our competitors are publicly-held companies;                            

    •   to enhance our ability to acquire other businesses, products or            
        technologies; and                                                          

    •   to provide our licensees greater assurances as to our long-term viability, 
        which is enhanced by being subject to the financial reporting and          
        disclosure obligations of a public company.                                

Pending its use for the purposes described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in this offering in short-term, investment grade, interest bearing
securities."

underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us and
assuming no exercise of the over-allotment options, will be approximately
US$83.3 million, based upon the initial offering price of US$17.00 per ADS. If
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will receive
approximately US$97.7 million. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the
sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are (i) to create a public market for
our ordinary shares for the benefit of all shareholders, and (ii) to attract and
retain qualified employees by providing them with equity incentives.

We may use the net proceeds from this offering:

†    to fund capital expenditures, such as the purchases of servers, computer     
     software and other equipment in connection with operating additional MMORPGs,
     including WoW, Joyful Journey West, Mystina Online and Granado Espada;       

†   to expand our sales and marketing efforts;

†   to license or otherwise acquire new online games attractive to users;

†   to fund working capital;

†    to repay the outstanding principal amount of our convertible loans and       
     interest accrued thereon, which together amounted to US$1.25 million as of   
     November 30, 2004; and/or                                                    

†   for general corporate purposes.

For a more detailed description of the terms of our outstanding convertible
loans that we will repay with the net proceeds from this offering, see “Related
Party Transactions — Convertible Loan Agreement.”

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we may make loans to our
subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated Chinese entities, or we may make
additional capital contributions to these entities. Any loans or capital
contributions to our Chinese subsidiary or affiliated Chinese entities are
subject to Chinese regulation and approval. For example:

†    loans by us to The9 Computer, as a foreign invested enterprise, to finance   
     its activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the
     State Administration of Foreign Exchange; and                                

†    loans by us to Shanghai IT, which is a domestic enterprise, must be approved 
     by the relevant government authority and must also be registered with the    
     State Administration of Foreign Exchange.                                    

We may also determine to finance The9 Computer by increase of capital
contributions. These capital contributions must be approved by the Ministry of
Commerce. Because Shanghai IT and Shanghai Advertisement are not foreign
invested enterprises, we are not likely to finance their activities by means of
a capital contribution due to regulatory issues relating to foreign investment
in domestic Chinese enterprises, as well as the licensing and other regulatory
issues discussed in “Chinese Government Regulations” elsewhere in this
prospectus. We cannot assure you that we can obtain these government
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future
loans or capital contribution by us to our Chinese subsidiary or affiliated
Chinese entities.

We have not identified amounts we plan to spend on each of these areas or the
timing of expenditures. Our management will have considerable discretion in the
use of the net proceeds received by us from this offering. Pending specific
application of the net proceeds, we plan to invest our net proceeds in
short-term bank deposits."

common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of $29.00 per
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $643.6 million, or
approximately $740.7 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option
to purchase additional shares.

    We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock for
general corporate purposes and working capital. In particular, we may use the
net proceeds to fund our development projects in Macau, the United Kingdom and
other jurisdictions. Pending their final use, the proceeds from this offering
will be invested in cash, cash equivalents or other short-term instruments.

    We have not yet finalized the financing options for the construction of the
Macao Venetian Casino Resort and have not finalized the budget and financing
options for the developments in the United Kingdom. As a result, we are unable
to determine whether we will spend any of the proceeds from this offering on
these projects or if we do so, in what amount. In addition, our expansion into
the United Kingdom is subject to changes in the United Kingdom's gaming laws
that have not been enacted yet. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion as to
the application of such proceeds. You will not have an opportunity to evaluate
the economic, financial or other information on which we base our decisions on
how to use these net proceeds."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $19.1 million after
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately
$1.5 million, a 1% nonaccountable expense allowance we have agreed to pay to the
underwriters and estimated offering expenses payable by us of approximately
$950,000. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds to us will be approximately $23.3 million. We
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by our
selling stockholder.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for general corporate
purposes and repayment of approximately $200,000 of an outstanding loan with a
private lender, which amount was borrowed to fund our working capital
requirements over the course of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. This
loan bears interest at a rate of 6%. This loan is callable upon 30 days' notice
or the completion of this offering. The lender also owns less than one-half
percent of our outstanding common stock and is otherwise not affiliated with our
company. No proceeds received by us from this offering will be used to make any
payments to our affiliates.

We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to us from this offering for the
repayment, from time to time, of amounts outstanding under our revolving loan
facility with Comerica Bank, including $1,000,000 which we borrowed subsequent
to September 30, 2004 and which we intend to repay immediately after the closing
of this offering. As of September 30, 2004, our outstanding indebtedness under
this loan facility was $7.1 million and accrues interest at a rate equal to
Comerica's prime rate plus a margin of 0.75%.

We will retain broad discretion over how to use these proceeds and may use any
portion of the proceeds in a manner different from this expected allocation if
we believe it would be in our best interest to do so. In addition, we may use a
portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or
products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies. We currently
have no commitments with respect to any such investment or acquisition.

Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering we receive in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities. We cannot predict whether our investment of the net
proceeds will yield a favorable return. We believe the proceeds from this
offering will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next
18 months."

   º (1)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
     received from Ms. Frangou described below. These funds will be repaid out
     of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon
     consummation of this offering.

    $156,465,000, or $180,576,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

    We have agreed to pay SCORY LLC d/b/a The Intelligent Office, an
unaffiliated third party, approximately $1,500 per month for office space and
certain other additional services and have agreed to pay other currently
unidentified unaffiliated third parties for general and administrative services
including secretarial support. We have agreed to pay up to a maximum of $5,500
for all of the foregoing services. None of our initial stockholders, 
including our officers and directors, has, or will have, any 
affiliation with these third parties. Upon completion of a business 
combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay this 
monthly fee.

    We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $1,746,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $60,000), with
the balance of $1,686,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

    Angeliki Frangou, our chairman of the board, chief executive officer and
president, has advanced to us a total of approximately $230,000 which was used
to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items
above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and
expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of
September 23, 2005 or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be
repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 18 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    No compensation of any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination
or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such shares into cash in
connection with a business combination which the public stockholder voted
against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
fund."

$116.8 million (approximately $134.7 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase up to 1,425,000 additional shares in full), after deducting
the estimated underwriting discount and our estimated expenses of the offering.
We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering and proceeds from our
revolving credit facility (i) to repay our operating company's $100 million term
loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, (ii) to redeem the
remainder of our series A preferred stock, of which approximately $38.5 million
in stated amount is outstanding, and pay all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon and (iii) for general corporate purposes. To the extent that we pay down
our term loan at closing, we expect to borrow approximately $24.2 million under
our revolving credit facility to pay off a portion of our term loan. In the
event that we are unable to obtain lender consent to pay down our term loan, in
addition to redeeming the remainder of our series A preferred stock, we will
instead apply approximately $76 million of the proceeds of the offering to repay
a portion of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility, and
our term loan will remain fully outstanding on an interim basis.

    Assuming the repayment in full of our term loan, Cerberus and its affiliates
will receive approximately 96.1% of the net proceeds of this offering, or
approximately $112.3 million, and $22.7 million of proceeds from our revolving
credit facility, in respect of (i) the redemption of the remaining series A
preferred stock, which excludes accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, and
(ii) the repayment of our term loan. Cerberus and its affiliates also received
approximately $159.6 million from the proceeds of the mortgage refinancing, as
described below.

    The $100 million term loan was entered into by our operating company on
May 7, 2004 with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., as sole lead arranger, sole
bookrunner, sole syndication agent, administrative agent and collateral agent,
and various financial institutions from time to time as lenders. Cerberus
acquired $69 million in aggregate principal amount of the term loan and its
affiliate, Aozora, acquired $25 million in aggregate principal amount of the
term loan. As of October 2, 2004, the interest rate under the term loan was 10%.
The term loan matures on November 6, 2009. Dividends accrue on our series A
preferred stock at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded quarterly and accrued
daily. All of our remaining series A preferred stock currently outstanding will
be redeemed with the proceeds we expect to receive from this offering.

    On October 27, 2004, we and our subsidiaries obtained from Column Financial,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, a new
mortgage loan in the principal amount of $165 million. The new mortgage loan is
secured by our 61 wholly-owned warehouses. The interest rate on our new mortgage
loan is a floating rate, equal to LIBOR plus 225 basis points determined
monthly.

   Proceeds from the new mortgage loan were used to (i) repay our existing
$100 million in principal amount of mortgage debt, plus $0.4 million in accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, and (ii) redeem 56,475 shares of our series A
preferred stock at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $59.2 million
(including all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon).

The proceeds from our operating company's term
loan, our series A preferred stock and our old mortgage were used to finance the
acquisition transactions.

    Our board of directors approved the offering and the other transactions
contemplated in this prospectus. Six of our directors do not meet the
independence standards promulgated by the New York Stock Exchange, which is
where we intend to list the common stock. Five of our nine directors are either
employees of or advisors to Cerberus."

current or future business. However, we have no specific plans, agreements or
commitments, oral or written, to do so. We are not currently engaged in any
substantive negotiations for any acquisition or joint venture. The amounts that
we actually expend for working capital purposes will vary significantly
depending on a number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, and
the amount of cash we generate from operations. As a result, we will retain
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering.

$150 million principal amount plus accrued interest outstanding under our senior
subordinated credit and guaranty agreement, or “bridge loan”, and the entire
$119 million of outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility.
The additional proceeds of $32 million will be used to fund general corporate
purposes, including exploration and development activities, oil and gas reserve
and leasehold acquisitions in the ordinary course of business, working capital
and other general corporate purposes. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised, the additional proceeds will be used for these same general
corporate purposes. The bridge loan was used to pay the purchase price and
transaction costs for the Piceance Basin properties we acquired on September 1,
2004. The bridge loan currently bears interest at a rate equal to the London
Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 4.0%. At December 9, 2004, the
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $119 million at
an interest rate of 4.0% per annum, and have been used primarily for our natural
gas and oil activities. Following the use of proceeds for this offering, we will
have $200 million available for borrowings under the credit facility.

we estimate the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately
$62.4 million.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, raise additional equity capital and facilitate future access to
public markets. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

†  approximately $15.0 million to expand our sales and marketing efforts in the 
   United States and internationally;                                           
  
†  approximately $8.0 million for research and development activities related to
   product development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals for additional 
   indications for our Fetal Fibronectin Test in the United States and          
   internationally. Potential additional indications include induction of labor,
   prediction of delivery date and bladder cancer monitoring. We believe that   
   completing clinical programs and preparing FDA submissions required in       
   connection with any FDA approval or clearance for the induction of labor,    
   delivery date and bladder cancer indications would require investments of at 
   least $0.5 million, $2.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. In addition,
   we believe that completing the work related to the FDA submission that would 
   be required to apply for FDA reapproval of the SalEst Test would require at  
   least $0.5 million;

   oncology-related products and other areas; and                               
  
†  the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes,        
   including approximately $5.0 million for investment in working capital       
   related to expected increases in accounts receivable and inventory and       
   approximately $2.5 million for increases in general and administrative costs,
   in particular those associated with being a publicly-held company, support of
   our information technology and communication systems and costs related to    
   human resources. We have no specific plan for use of the remaining proceeds. 


We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or in-license
complementary businesses, products or technologies. Although we have no specific
arrangements with respect to acquisitions, we evaluate acquisition opportunities
and engage in related discussions from time to time. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds from this offering. We reserve the right to change the allocation
of the net proceeds based on the changing needs of our business, including the
progress and results of our research and development activities, the results of
our sales and marketing efforts, acquisition opportunities and competitive
developments. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of
our management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering.

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds

each case, this assumes deduction of estimated offering expenses of $300,000 and
underwriting discounts and commissions. We intend to use up to $4.0 million of

intend to use approximately $36.4 million of the net proceeds from this offering
to repay all of our existing subordinated indebtedness, $45.8 million to repay a
portion of our existing senior indebtedness and $22.9 million to repurchase a
portion of our outstanding shares of our preferred stock and preferred stock
warrants. We are repurchasing these shares of preferred stock and preferred
stock warrants in order to eliminate the liquidation preference and other rights
of such shares and warrants and to provide additional liquidity to the holders
of such shares and warrants. Our estimated offering costs include $2.0 million

advisory services rendered by Olympus Advisory Partners to us in connection with
the offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from the underwriters’
over-allotment option, to the extent exercised, to further reduce our borrowings
under the new senior credit facility.

As of October 2, 2004, the existing indebtedness to be repaid from a portion of
the net proceeds from this offering and the preferred stock and preferred stock
warrants to be repurchased from a portion of the net proceeds consisted of the
following:

    •   approximately $45.8 million under our term loans, which bear interest at a 
        variable rate (5.5% weighted average interest rate at October 2, 2004) and 
        have a final maturity of March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009; and            

    •   approximately $22.9 million in aggregate liquidation value, including      
        accrued but unpaid dividends which accrue at a rate of 8% per annum on the 
        sum of the liquidation value plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends, of 
        convertible preferred stock outstanding or issuable upon the exercise of   
        preferred stock warrants.                                                  

As of October 2, 2004, the Olympus funds held subordinated indebtedness with an
aggregate principal balance of $8.0 million.

As of October 2, 2004, the number, aggregate liquidation value, including
accrued but unpaid dividends, and holders of shares of our preferred stock
outstanding or issuable upon the exercise of preferred stock warrants that we
will repurchase with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering were as
follows:

    •   approximately 15,531 shares of preferred stock outstanding or issuable upon
        the exercise of preferred stock warrants with an aggregate liquidation     
        value, including accrued but unpaid dividends, of $19.0 million held by the

    •   approximately 983 shares of preferred stock outstanding or issuable upon   
        the exercise of preferred stock warrants with an aggregate liquidation     
        value, including accrued but unpaid dividends, of $1.1 million held by     
        Windjammer Mezzanine & Equity Fund II, L.P.;

    •   approximately 110 shares of preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation  
        value, including accrued but unpaid dividends, of $0.1 million held by     
        certain of our senior officers and directors; and

In the aggregate, we expect that Olympus and its affiliates will receive
approximately $27.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering. See “Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions.” All of our outstanding preferred stock
and preferred stock warrants not repurchased will be converted into shares of
our common stock or warrants to purchase our common stock prior to the
completion of this offering."

million. We will not receive any portion of the net proceeds received by the
selling shareholders from the sale of their shares.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock and facilitate our access to the public capital markets. We are not
undertaking our initial public offering to raise funds in order to satisfy any
particular capital need or plans. We currently have no specific plan for using
the net proceeds, although we may use the net proceeds in the following manner:

    •  approximately 50%, or $28 million, for expansion of our operations through 
       the development of additional products and services;

       costs associated with relocating and expanding our offices; and            

    •  approximately 5%, or $3 million, for working capital, such as payment of

offering designated for expansion of operations to acquire or invest in
businesses, products or technologies that are complementary to our own, such as
those in connection with residential mortgage-related services. We are not
currently a party to any agreements or commitments, and we have no current
understandings with respect to any acquisitions.

We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds to be
received upon completion of this offering and, at the date hereof, cannot
accurately predict the amounts that we may spend for any particular purpose. The
amounts of our actual expenditures will be influenced by several factors,

shares by the selling stockholders in this offering.

    We estimate we will use approximately $5.3 million to $6.6 million of the
net proceeds of this offering received by us to complete our MIRA-1 trial, a
related crossover trial and additional anticipated clinical trials and complete
the FDA approval process.

    We estimate we will use approximately $17.5 million to $18.8 million of the
net proceeds of this offering received by us to build our infrastructure,
including distribution, sales and marketing, and to facilitate the
commercialization of the RHEO System if and when we receive FDA approval. We
estimate that infrastructure growth will result in increased employee related
costs of approximately $11.0 million to $11.5 million, with related travel and
administrative costs of approximately $4.7 million to $5.0 million. We estimate
the costs of consultants to support our infrastructure development will be
approximately $1.3 million and capital costs for office leaseholds and home
office support will be approximately $0.5 million to $1.0 million.

    We estimate we will use approximately $9.5 million to $10.5 million of the
net proceeds of this offering received by us to purchase and accumulate
inventory of components of the RHEO System to facilitate rapid commercialization
in the United States if and when we receive FDA approval.

    Of the $9.5 million to $10.5 million of the proceeds which will be used to
purchase inventory, $9.3 million to $10.3 million will be allocated to purchases
from Asahi Medical, which currently owns less than 5% of our common stock.

    We will pay MeSys, which manufactures the pumps for Diamed and is not one of
our stockholders, $0.2 million. The amounts to be purchased with the proceeds
from this offering represent excess inventory purchases from the current date to
the third quarter of 2006, net of inventory purchased for commercial purposes.

    The $5.3 million to $6.6 million of the proceeds which will be used to fund
the completion of the MIRA-1 trial, related crossover trial and additional
anticipated clinical trial will be paid to:

   1.  third party consultants, some of whom are our stockholders but none of    
       whom will beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock immediately   
       following this offering. The following are the principal consultants who  
       will receive a portion of the proceeds:                                   


      • Promedica International, a contract research organization, which        
        oversees the treatment centers conducting the MIRA-1 study. We expect to
        pay Promedica International $1.5 million for certain fees and expenses  
        for the period from 2003 to the completion of the MIRA-1 study.         
     
      • McGarvey Group, FDA specialists who assist us in compiling our data for

        Operations and one of our directors from April 1997 to September 2004,  
        is also president and a significant stockholder, is our exclusive       
        provider of warehousing, order fulfillment, shipping, billing services  
        and customer service related to shipping and billing. We pay Apheresis  
        Technologies for these services 5% of the cost to us of goods delivered 
        to Apheresis Technologies’ facilities, plus shipping and related        
        charges. We pay this 5% fee when we sell the goods. The total amount    
        paid to Apheresis Technologies pursuant to the distribution services    
        agreement since 2002 is $26,270. We do not pay a salary directly to     
        Mr. Cornish for acting as our Vice President of Operations, however, we 
        reimburse Apheresis Technologies for 80% of the salary                  
        and benefits for employees of Apheresis Technologies who provide        
        services to us, including Mr. Cornish, who provides regulatory support  
        for the MIRA-1 trial. His total salary from Apheresis Technologies is   
        $100,000, of which we reimburse $80,000. Please see “Certain            
        Relationships and Related Transactions” for more information on our     
        relationship with Apheresis Technologies. Mr. Cornish also manages      
        Cornish Properties, which leases space to us in Palm Harbor, Florida for
        clinical trial activities, office space and storage under a lease that  
        expires on December 31, 2005. Currently the monthly lease cost is $2,745
        and the total rent paid to date to Cornish Properties is $30,195. The   
        total aggregate we expect to pay to Apheresis Technologies and Cornish  
        Properties is $173,685 until the completion of the MIRA-1 trial.        
        Mr. John Cornish, immediately following this offering, along with his   
        family will beneficially own approximately 2.4% of our outstanding      
        common stock.                                                           
     
      • Don Sanders, who provides consulting support through the Center for     
        Clinical Research, for which he receives a monthly fee of $5,000.       
        Dr. Sanders, immediately following this offering will beneficially own  
        approximately 2.0% of our outstanding common stock.                     


   2.  individual clinical trial sites of which some of the members/ owners of   
       the sites are our stockholders (none in excess of 5% immediately following
       this offering); and                                                       
  
   3.  corporate overhead costs which include costs for employees, some of whom  
       hold shares of our common stock and options. None of these employees will 
       beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock immediately 
       following this offering.                                                  


    The proceeds of this offering which will be used to build our infrastructure
will be used for additional employee related costs, travel and administrative
costs, consulting and capital costs for leaseholds and costs associated with the
maintenance of information systems. Included in these costs is an estimated
monthly charge of $3,000 to $5,000 payable to TLC Vision to provide information
systems support.

    We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds of this offering received
by us for general corporate purposes.

    The amount and timing of what we actually spend for these purposes may vary
significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future sales
and cash generated by operations and the other factors we describe in “Risk
Factors”. Therefore, we will have broad discretion in the way we use the net
proceeds from this offering received by us."

common stock being offered hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts and
estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $485.0 million. We intend to
use approximately $44.4 million of the net proceeds to repay certain of our
indebtedness and $2.0 million for other general corporate purposes. We intend to
use the remaining net proceeds of approximately $438.5 million ($433.4 million
assuming our existing stockholders who are members of management receive their
dividend in shares of common stock instead of cash) to pay a dividend to our
stockholders existing immediately prior to the offering, consisting of
affiliates of First Reserve, Blackstone, AMCI and certain members of senior
management. In the event that our existing stockholders who are members of
management receive their share of the dividend in shares of common stock instead
of cash, we will use the $5.1 million of proceeds to repay indebtedness or for
general corporate purposes. We also intend to use the proceeds we receive from
any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional
shares to pay an additional dividend to our existing stockholders. In the event
the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares, the amount
available to repay debt would be reduced to $40.4 million as a result of payment
by us of the underwriting discount. However, in the event management receives
their dividend in stock as described above, such amount would then increase to
$45.5 million.

    The determination whether to pay management's share of the dividend in
additional shares or in cash will be made by the board of directors in its
discretion at the time of declaration of the dividend, which we expect to be
prior to consummation of this offering. We currently expect that the board will
declare management's share of the dividend in additional shares of common stock.

    We currently expect that the indebtedness to be repaid with a portion of
such net proceeds will be a portion of our term loan under the Senior Credit
Facilities. The term loan currently accrues interest at LIBOR plus 2% per annum
and is due to mature in seven years, with quarterly amortization prior thereto.
The proceeds from the term loan were used, together with other related
financings, to finance the Acquisition and to pay related transaction fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition and the related financings."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $27.0 million, or
approximately $31.2 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full. This estimate is based upon an initial public offering price of
$5.50 per share less estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
offering expenses payable by us.

    We intend to use these net proceeds approximately as follows:

   •  20% to fund our clinical trials;                                            
  
   •  15% to fund our investigation of drug combination and coating technologies; 
  
   •  35% to develop our sales and marketing capabilities, promote pre- and       
      post-commercialization physician education and awareness, and create product
      marketing programs, an international distribution network and a domestic    
      sales team; and                                                             
  
   •  30% for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs,        
      facilities expansion and potential acquisitions.                            


    While we do not currently contemplate the need to expand our facility, our
anticipated future rapid expansion will likely require additional manufacturing
and office space.

    Our potential use of proceeds for acquisitions may include the acquisition
or licensing of rights to potential new drug combinations or coating
technologies. Although we expect to periodically evaluate acquisition and
licensing opportunities, we currently have no commitments or agreements with
respect to any specific acquisition or license.

    Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of
this offering in short- to medium-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
securities."

from the sale of ADSs in this offering. Net proceeds are what we will receive
after payment of our share of all underwriting discounts, commissions and
expenses of this offering. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale
of ADSs by the selling shareholders.

We expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

•    approximately US$6.0 million for research and development of new software   
     products and services;

     of and additions to our technologies and the expansion of our existing      
     facilities, as well as the purchase of new facilities and real estate to be 
     used primarily for two new research and development centers; and            


we intend to use our remaining proceeds for (i) working capital, (ii) other
general corporate purposes, and (iii) acquisitions of, or investments in,
complementary businesses, products or technologies in China and elsewhere.
Although we periodically engage in preliminary discussions with respect to
potential acquisitions, we are not currently a party to any binding agreement or
commitment with respect to any acquisition.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on several
factors, including (i) the progress of our research and development efforts,
(ii) the amount of cash generated or used by our ongoing operations, and
(iii) the availability and cost of acquisitions of or investments in
complementary businesses, products and technologies.

We have not made any other specific expenditure plans with respect to the net
proceeds we will receive from this offering. Accordingly, our management will
have significant flexibility in applying our net proceeds. Pending their use, we
intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt
instruments."
