in this offering will be approximately $6.1 million, (or approximately $7.1
million if the representative exercises its over-allotment option in full),
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us and assuming no proceeds from the exercise of
the warrants. We will only receive additional proceeds from the exercise of the
warrants issuable in connection with this offering if such warrants are
exercised at their exercise price of $6.25 (125% of the public offering price of
the units) and the holders of such warrants pay the exercise price in cash upon
such exercise and do not utilize the cashless exercise provision of the
warrants.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $2,500,000 to fund our initial Phase 3 clinical trial for the
  use of AD04 to treat AUD, including, without limitation, the setup and 
  validation of the AD04 companion diagnostic test;

. approximately $1,400,000 for personnel costs, including enhancing our
  executive team to manage and grow our business, including hiring a Chief
  Financial Officer with public company experience and a Chief Development
  Officer to oversee the clinical trials of AD04;                         

. approximately $530,000 to repay loans that are due August 1, 2018 but subject 
  to redemption at the option of the note holders upon consummation of any debt 
  or equity financing, including this offering, or a change of control;

. approximately $100,000 for a settlement payment due related to a previous debt
  obligation;                                                                   

. approximately $150,000 for payments under the license agreement for the 
  patents covering AD04, including the prosecution and maintenance of the AD04 
  patent estate;

. approximately $170,000 for research and development, including without
  limitation, potentially developing a once a day formulation of AD04,
  exploratory development work testing AD04 for other indications, and seeking
  promising product pipeline assets; and

. the balance for working capital and general corporate purposes.

In addition, if the holder of the June 2018 Senior Note does not elect to
convert the note prior to the maturity date of March 5, 2019, we would be
required to use the proceeds of this offering to repay the $325,000 principal
amount which would reduce the net proceeds of this offering to approximately
$5.8 million.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received from this offering. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors including the
progress in, and costs of, our clinical trials and other preclinical development
programs and the amount of funding, if any, received from grants, collaborators
or partners. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of management regarding the application of the net proceeds from the offering.
We may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate the net proceeds of this
offering; however, any such reallocation would be substantially limited to the
categories set forth above or additional research and development, including
additional clinical trials, as we do not intend to use the net proceeds for
other purposes.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

$51.7 million (£36.9 million), based on the initial public offering price of
$20.00 per ADS, or approximately $52.3 million (£37.3 million) if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the
selling shareholders, although we will bear the costs, other than underwriting
discounts and commissions, associated with those sales.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility and create a public market for our ADSs. We intend to use
the net proceeds we receive from this offering to repay in full amounts
outstanding under our revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank PLC, which has a
maturity date of December 19, 2020 and bears interest, at our option, at a rate
equal to either the LIBOR rate or the EURIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin
ranging from 0.8% to 1.4% per annum, based upon the net leverage ratio. As of
March 31, 2018, there was £2.9 million and $29.0 million outstanding under the
£50.0 million primary revolving credit facility, $6.0 million was drawn of the
$12.1 million line of credit facility and €9.3 million was drawn of the €9.5
million guarantee facility, respectively. We used the proceeds borrowed under
our revolving credit facility principally to fund our acquisition of Velocity
Partners, LLC. We also intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for
general corporate purposes, including working capital, selling, general and
administrative expenses and capital expenditures. We also may use a portion of
the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, services or
technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any specific
acquisitions at this time.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from
this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on
many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of
our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities and government

Private Placements of US$164.1 million, or US$180.2 million if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full. This includes
US$104.1 million in net proceeds from this offering, or US$120.2 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us, as well as US$60 million in proceeds from the Concurrent Private
Placements.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
ordinary shares in the form of ADSs for the benefit of all shareholders, retain
talented employees by providing them with equity incentives and obtain
additional capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the
Concurrent Private Placements as follows:

• approximately 40% for research and development to continue to strengthen our
  AI-driven content discovery and recommendation platform and overall product
  portfolio;
 
• approximately 25% for distribution and marketing to further improve brand
  awareness across all markets and attract new users to our products;
 
• approximately 25% to pursue strategic partnership, investment and acquisition
  opportunities, though currently we have not identified any potential targets;
  and
 
• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
 
The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our
business, and our plans and business conditions. The foregoing represents our
current intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions to use
and allocate the net proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placements. Our management will have significant flexibility in applying
discretion to apply the net proceeds of the offering and the Concurrent Private
Placements. If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may
use the proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placements
differently than as described in this prospectus.

deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities."
"SUMMIT WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/summit-wireless-technologies-inc-1001707-86566,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/summit-wireless-technologies-inc-1001707-86566,424B4,7/27/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12877049,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 2,400,000 shares
of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $10,355,000, based
upon an assumed initial public offering price of $5.00 per share after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$5.00 per share would increase or decrease the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $2,196,000, assuming that the amount of shares of
common stock offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
remains the same, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
payable by us. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares of common
stock we are offering. An increase or decrease of 100,000 shares of common stock
offered by us in this offering would increase or decrease the net proceeds to us
by approximately $457,500, assuming that the assumed initial price to the public
remains the same, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
payable by us. We do not expect that a change by these amounts in the initial
offering price to the public or the common stock offered by us would have a
material effect on our uses of the proceeds from this offering, although it may
accelerate the time at which we will need to seek additional capital.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
future access to the capital markets. Although we have not yet determined with
certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for product
development, sales and marketing, repayment of debt, working capital and other
general corporate purposes, including investments in sales and marketing in the
United States and internationally. We intend to use approximately $3.6 million
of this offering for research and development and productizing our intellectual
property. We may also use a portion of the proceeds from this offering for
acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or
technologies, although we do not currently have any plans for any such
acquisitions or investments. We have not allocated specific amounts of net
proceeds for any of these purposes.

The Company plans to use the proceeds of this offering, net of expenses,
approximately as follows:

                                          30%             50%             75%             100%

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. Given the best efforts
nature of this offering, in the event that only 75%, 50%, or substantially less
than half of the shares of common stock offered pursuant to this offering are
sold, we expect to use the resulting proceeds first, to pay the expenses
associated with the offering and to repay certain debt including (a) $100,000 of
the amounts due to Hallo Development Co, LLC pursuant to an unsecured
convertible promissory note, as amended, issued by the Company in 2010 and due
July 25, 2018 and (b) $100,000 of the amounts due to the holder of a convertible
promissory note, as amended, issued by the Company in January 2015 and due July
25, 2018, and thereafter, to apply the remaining proceeds to the categories in
the use of proceeds table above in the same order of priority and in
approximately the same proportions as they would have been applied had 100% of
the shares of common stock been sold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not
intend to close this offering unless we sell at least $10,000,000 of common
stock in order to satisfy the listing conditions to trade our common stock on
the NASDAQ.

We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of
this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth
above. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in applying
the net proceeds of this offering. The timing and amount of our actual
expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows from operations
and the anticipated growth of our business. Pending their use, we intend to
invest the net proceeds of this offering in a variety of capital-preservation
investments, including short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities. In addition, as this offering is a “best efforts”
offering, if we are unable to raise substantial funds from this offering, the
amount of net proceeds that will be available for our use may be less than
anticipated. Consequently, the value of your investments in us will fluctuate
with our ability to allocate such proceeds to their intended uses."

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash, as follows:

. approximately $30.0 to $32.0 million to complete our ongoing Phase 3 clinical
  trial and other development work for LIQ861;

. approximately $1.2 to $1.8 million to advance LIQ865 through our planned
  Phase 2-enabling toxicology studies initiated in 2018;

. approximately $12.0 to $13.0 million to fund operations supporting the
  development and commercial activities for LIQ861 and LIQ865; and

. the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development and
commercialization efforts, the status of and results from clinical trials and

our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets,
although we have no current agreements, commitments or understandings to do so.

As of March 31, 2018, we had cash of $17.6 million. Based on our planned use of
the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and current revenue
forecasts, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to
support research and development needs and to fund our operating expenses and
capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2019. We have based
this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not expect
that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash will be
sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development and
commercialization of any of our product candidates.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

over-allotment option in full, based upon the initial public offering price of
$23.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
future access to the capital markets. Although we have not yet determined with
certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for working
capital and other general corporate purposes, including continuing to invest in
sales and marketing and in our solutions and increasing international expansion.

We may also use a portion of the proceeds from this offering for acquisitions or
strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies, although we
do not currently have any plans for any such acquisitions or investments. We
have not allocated specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on
many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of
our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities and government
securities."

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately US$630.0 million to enhance and expand our business operations;

• approximately US$630.0 million for research and development, to continue to 
  invest in and develop our technology infrastructure; and

• the balance for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital
  needs and potential strategic investments and acquisitions, although we have 
  not identified any specific investments or acquisition opportunities at this
  time.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply 
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business 
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

$490.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering

exchanging owners that elect to sell their Focus LLC units and pay $24.4 million
to other exchanging owners that elect to sell their Focus LLC units.

offering to Focus LLC (or $529.3 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full) in exchange for 15,151,515 common
units. Focus LLC will use $392.5 million of such contribution amount to reduce

The remaining $62.2 million of such contribution amount (or $136.8 million if
the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full)
will be used by Focus LLC for acquisitions and general corporate business
purposes and to pay the expenses of this offering.

Borrowings under our credit facilities were primarily made for acquisitions, 
cash liquidity for unitholders and other general business purposes. As of
March 31, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $998.0 million at stated value
under our credit facilities. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the
weighted-average interest rate under our credit facilities was approximately 6%.
As of March 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of
$2.5 million, bearing interest at an annual rate of approximately 3%. After
payoff of our second lien term loan, the remaining credit facilities will
consist of our first lien term loan and first lien revolving credit facility,
which currently have July 2024 and July 2022 maturity dates, respectively. In
June 2018, we entered into an amendment to our credit facilities that will
become effective in connection with the closing of this offering."

offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale
of shares by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use approximately $24 million of the net proceeds to purchase
shares of our common stock (at a price equal to the price paid by the
underwriters for shares of our common stock in this offering) from funds
affiliated with Benefit Street Partners and Oaktree Capital Management. Of the
remaining approximately $112 million of net proceeds received by us, we intend
to use approximately $52 million to repay borrowings under our RBL Facility and
approximately $60 million to fund the cash payable to holders of our Series A
Preferred Stock in connection with the Preferred Stock Conversion.

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,
we expect to receive an additional approximately $20 million of net proceeds
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares
by the selling stockholders. We intend to use approximately $3 million of the
net proceeds we receive to purchase additional shares from funds affiliated with
Benefit Street Partners. Of the remaining approximately $17 million of the net
proceeds received by us, we intend to use approximately $14 million of the
proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under our RBL Facility and the
remaining amounts for general corporate purposes. To the extent that the
underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,
the amount of shares sold by us and the selling shareholders will be reduced pro
rata, and the amount of shares repurchased from Benefit Street Partners by us
will similarly be reduced pro rata.

consummation of the Preferred Stock Conversion. We expect to purchase with our
proceeds from this offering 1,391,967 shares and 410,229 shares of our common
stock from funds affiliated with Benefit Street Partners and Oaktree Capital
Management, respectively, for aggregate amounts of approximately $18 million and
$6 million, respectively. Immediately following this offering and the purchase
of our common stock from funds affiliated with Benefit Street Partners and

Oaktree Capital Management will hold 18,588,691 shares (or 22.9%) and 7,678,671

As of June 30, 2018, we had approximately $66 million in borrowings outstanding
under the RBL Facility, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately
4.5%. Borrowings under the RBL Facility were primarily incurred to finance costs
associated with the early termination of certain commodity derivative contracts.
Amounts repaid under the RBL Facility may be re-borrowed from time to time,
subject to the terms of the facility, and we intend to do so from time to time
for short-term liquidity and to fund periodic working capital shortfalls. The
RBL Facility will mature on July 29, 2022."

approximately $68.0 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares is exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered
by us in this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use the
net proceeds of this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents and cash generated from existing partnerships, as follows:

• approximately $28.0 million to fund commercialization investments for our
  late-stage epilepsy products, Libervant and Sympazan, as well as our ALS  
  product candidate, AQST-117;                                              

• approximately $13.0 million to fund the commencement of our clinical trials
  for our complex molecules AQST-108 and AQST-305;                   

• approximately $2.0 million to identify our new pipeline candidates in CNS 
  diseases and other therapeutic categories and indications; and            

• the remainder for general corporate purposes, including working capital and
  capital expenditures.                                                 

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, combined with the revenue
from partnered product activities and our existing cash and cash equivalents,
will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next 24 months,
including the investments identified above. Our expected use of net proceeds
from this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present
plans and business condition, which could change in the future as our plans and
business conditions evolve. For example, we may change our priorities due to the
success or failure of certain of our clinical trials or what we perceive the
market for our product candidates to be and as such may reallocate resources to
other product candidates in our pipeline ahead of those we currently intend to
prioritize with the use of proceeds from this offering. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds to be received upon the consummation of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the progress,
cost and results of our proprietary commercialized product candidate programs,
including our planned clinical trials, and whether we are able to enter into
future collaborative arrangements. As a result, our management will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying
on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Our strategic plan includes the intent to expand our portfolio of product
candidates through business development with a focus on CNS and other diseases
where patients are significantly underserved by current medicines. Consequently,
we might also devote more resources to other potential drug candidates in our
pipeline or we might identify and develop other drug candidates not yet in our
pipeline. We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our
current business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies,
medicines or technologies. While we have no existing agreements, commitments or
understandings for any specific future acquisitions or in-licenses at this time,
we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
United States government."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds loaned to
    us by our sponsor. These funds are currently due on demand and will be
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 4.0%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $1,600,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $1,840,000 if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account. 50% of such amount (equal to 2.0%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering) is payable based on the number of
    shares that are not redeemed by our shareholders in connection with our
    initial business combination. The remaining funds will be released to us and
    can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for
    general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions. No discounts or commissions will be
    paid with respect to the purchase of the private units.

(4) Upon closing of the initial business combination, the funds held in the
    trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our expenses relating to
    acquiring a target business.

(5) Does not include any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
    that may be available to us.

A total of $40,000,000 (or $46,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private units described in this prospectus will be placed in a trust
account in the United States at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, subject to
increase in the event that our sponsor elects to extend the period of time to
consummate a business combination, and will be invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act and which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for all interest
income that may be released to us to pay taxes, and up to $50,000 to pay
dissolution expenses, as discussed below, none of the funds held in the trust
account will be released from the trust account until the earlier of: (1) the
completion of our initial business combination within the required time period;
(2) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not
completed an initial business combination in the required time period; and (3)
the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
shareholder vote to amend our memorandum and articles of association (A) to
modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the
required time period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our sponsor or an affiliate of
our sponsor or our officers and directors, but such members of our management
team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq, we have
agreed to pay an affiliate of a member of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per
month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services.
Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will
cease paying these monthly fees.

As of March 28, 2018, our sponsor has loaned us a total of $75,588 to be used
for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest
bearing and unsecured. The loan is due on the earlier of September 30, 2018 or
the date on which we consummate the offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such notes may be convertible into additional private units at a price of $10.00
per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000
ordinary shares if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted (including 15,000
shares upon the closing of our initial business combination in respect of
150,000 rights included in such units), as well as 150,000 warrants to purchase
75,000 shares).

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be
further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination.
If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate
our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of this
offering (or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the
period of time to consummate a business combination), or (iii) the redemption of
our public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our memorandum
and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering
(or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of
time to consummate a business combination), or (B) with respect to any other
provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity,
subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares, private shares and shares underlying private
rights and private warrants in connection with the consummation of our initial
business combination. Our initial shareholders have also agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to any public shares purchased during or after
the offering in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their
rights to liquidating distributions with respect to its founder shares and
private shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within
12 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months from the closing
of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business
combination). However, if our initial shareholders acquire public shares in or
after this offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions
with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business
combination within the required time period. Our initial shareholders have also
agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares,
private shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to
approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(a) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12
months (or up to 21 months) from the closing of this offering or (b) with
respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity."

the net proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock in this offering, after
deducting estimated underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses,
will be approximately $46.5 million if we sell the minimum of $50,000,000 of
common stock or $60.9million if we sell all $65,500,000 of common stock in this
offering. However, this is a best efforts offering and, in the event that the
minimum amount of common stock is not sold and all funds are returned to
purchasers, we will not sell any shares or receive any proceeds.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily as follows
(listed in the order of priority):

. approximately $11 million ($11 million if the maximum amount is sold) for 
  ongoing development activities for PRV-6527 which will allow us to generate   
  top-line data from our Phase 2a clinical trial;                               
                                                                              
. approximately $4 million ($4 million if the maximum amount is sold) for       
  ongoing development activities for PRV-300 which will allow us to generate    
  top-line data from our Phase 1b clinical trial;                             
                                                                       
. approximately $7 million (approximately $11 million if the maximum amount is  
  sold) for development activities for PRV-031 which will allow us to commence a
  Phase 3 clinical trial;                                                     
                                                             
. approximately $8 million (approximately $13 million if the maximum amount is 
  sold) for ongoing development activities for PRV-101 which will allow us to 
  file an IND and commence a Phase 1 clinical trial;                          
                                                                             
. approximately $4 million (approximately $7 million if the maximum amount is   
  sold) for development activities for PRV-3279 which will allow us to plan and
  design a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial;                                       
                                                                            
. approximately $12 million (approximately $15 million if the maximum amount is 
  sold) for general corporate purposes, which may include the acquisition or    
  in-licensing of other product candidates.                                     

Even if we only raise the minimum amount in the offering, we expect that the net
proceeds will be sufficient to complete our ongoing IBD clinical trials. If we
only raise the minimum amount, we may need to delay certain aspects of the
development of PRV-031, PRV-3279 and PRV-101 until such time we have sufficient
funds.

Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the
acquisition or licensing of additional technologies, other assets or businesses,
or for other strategic investments or opportunities, we have no current
understandings, agreements or commitments to do so.
 
Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities.

We believe the net proceeds from this offering (assuming that the minimum amount
of common stock offered is sold), combined with our existing cash resources,
will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for
approximately 24 months from the date of this offering. We believe the net
proceeds from this offering (assuming that the maximum amount of common stock
offered is sold), combined with our existing cash resources, will be sufficient
to fund our projected operating requirements for approximately 30 months from
the date of this offering. However, the expected net proceeds from this offering
are not expected to be sufficient for us to complete the development and
commercialization of any of our drug candidates or platform technologies. Until
we are able to generate sustainable revenues that generate a profit, we expect
to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings,
debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. However,
there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing
on acceptable terms and in the amounts necessary to fully fund our future
operating requirements."

the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, at
the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as follows:

• approximately $20.0 million to fund the development of RP1 through the
  completion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial in four solid tumor types;

• approximately $15.0 million to fund our share of the costs to fully recruit
  our planned Phase 2 clinical trial with RP1 in CSCC;

  Massachusetts; and

• the remainder for general corporate purposes, including working capital
  requirements and operating expenses.

of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds from this offering or the amounts that we will actually
spend on the uses set forth above. The amount and timing of our actual
expenditures depend on several factors, including the progress and results of
our research and development efforts, the amount of cash used by our operations,

allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. However, based on our current
plans, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, will enable us to
fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second
half of 2021. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be
wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we
expect. Pending application of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net
proceeds from this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing

retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of CPI-1205 for
the treatment of mCRPC, our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of CPI-1205 for the
treatment of solid tumors and our Phase 2 clinical trial of CPI-0610 for the
treatment of myelofibrosis, and to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2020. We do not anticipate
that the net proceeds from this offering together with our existing cash and
cash equivalents will be sufficient to allow us to complete Phase 3 clinical
trials for any of our product candidates. We will require additional capital to
advance CPI-1205, CPI-0610 and CPI-0209 through necessary clinical trials and
complete the clinical development of CPI-1205, CPI-0610 and CPI-0209 or
commercialize any of the product candidates, if we receive regulatory approval.
We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong,
including assumptions regarding the clinical trials necessary for FDA approval
of our product candidates, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we
currently expect. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with
product development, including the risks and uncertainties with respect to
successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials, at this time, we cannot
reasonably estimate the amount of additional funding that will be necessary to
complete the clinical development of CPI-1205, CPI-0610, CPI-0209 or any future
product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for CPI-1205, CPI-0610,
CPI-0209 or other product candidates, we expect to incur significant
commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing
and distribution.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $138.3 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option to purchase additional shares
of Class 2 common stock from us, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $159.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We are undertaking this offering in order to increase our liquidity and raise
capital to further develop our cultivation and processing capacity. We intend to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: (i) approximately
$52.9 million to fund the build out of cultivation and processing capacity at
our facilities; (ii) approximately $37.0 million to repay outstanding principal
and interest under the Privateer Holdings debt facilities which we have used for
working capital and general corporate purposes; and (iii) the remainder for
working capital, future acquisitions and general corporate purposes. As of
June 30, 2018 there was approximately $37.0 million outstanding under the
Privateer Holdings debt facilities and the interest rate was 2.54% for 2017
(which represented 2.4 times the mid-term Applicable Federal Rate). The
Privateer Holdings debt facilities are payable on demand of Privateer Holdings.

Of the approximately $52.9 million of proceeds from this offering that are
proposed to be used to build-out cultivation and processing capacity, we expect
that approximately $28.7 million will be used to build-out and expand capacity
at our Canadian facilities and that approximately $24.2 million will be used to
build-out and expand capacity at our international facilities.

In 2018, we began an expansion plan that is expected to expand our production
footprint from approximately 60,000 square feet to approximately 912,000 square
feet. The High Park domestic expansion projects are expected to be ready to
commence production in the third quarter of 2018, and the Tilray North America
Campus expansion is expected to be ready to commence production in the first
half of 2019, in each case subject to Health Canada approvals. International
projects include a greenhouse and a processing facility in Portugal. The
business objective of our international projects is to increase our penetration
into the EU market, diversify our supply chain and lower production costs.
Construction and improvement of facilities are necessary for us to achieve these
objectives. Most of the capital expenditures are expected to be allocated to
land, buildings, mechanical, electrical and the purchase of equipment for
cultivation and processing.

The initial phase of our Canadian expansion is expected to be completed over the
next three to nine months. Proceeds of approximately $5.5 million are expected
to be allocated to the completion of High Park Farms in Enniskillen, Ontario and
approximately $13.2 million are expected to be allocated to the High Park
Processing Facility in London, Ontario. Approximately $10.0 million of the
proceeds are expected to be allocated to the expansion of processing, research
and development and office space at our Tilray North America Campus. Our
domestic expansion plans have commenced in the High Park facilities and the
expansion at the Tilray North America Campus is expected to begin once this
offering has been completed.

Current projects related to international expansion are expected to be completed
over the next 12-month period. Proceeds of approximately $24.2 million are
expected to be allocated to the construction of a greenhouse and processing
facility for our Tilray European Union Campus in Portugal in accordance with
applicable regulatory requirements.

The expected use of proceeds from this offering represent our intentions based
upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering."

to purchase additional shares from us.

offering to redeem all of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock, which
consists of 8,559 shares of Series A preferred stock, 428 shares of Series B

due 2020 as promptly as practicable following the completion of this offering,
the redemption of such securities is subject to regulatory approval, and

support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We currently
anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $94.5 million for the development of our lead compound, AK002; 
  and

• the remainder for other research and development activities, working capital
  and general corporate purposes.                                   

We expect that the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to complete our
Phase 2 trial for eosinophilic gastritis, Phase 2 trial for chronic urticaria,
Phase 1 trial for indolent systemic mastocytosis and Phase 1 trial for severe
allergic conjunctivitis. We also anticipate that the net proceeds will allow us
to complete a nine-month safety exposure trial for eosinophilic gastritis.
Progressing the development of AK002 through FDA approval for any of these
indications will require additional financing, which may not be available on
acceptable terms, if at all.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through license or acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary

the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:

• approximately $45.0 million to fund the clinical development of CRN00808;

• approximately $15.0 million to fund preclinical and clinical development of

offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund
our operations for at least the next 24 months, although there can be no
assurance in that regard. In particular, we expect that the net proceeds from
this offering will allow us to complete our planned Phase 2 clinical trials for
CRN00808 and our planned Phase 1 clinical trials for CRN02481 and CRN01941.

condition. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty
all of the particular uses for the proceeds to be received upon the completion
of this offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth
above. The net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and cash
equivalents, will not be sufficient for us to fund all of our product candidates
through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to
complete the development and commercialization of all of our product candidates.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the time and cost necessary to conduct our planned
preclinical and clinical trials, the results of our preclinical and clinical
trials and other factors described under “Risk factors” in this prospectus, as
well as the amount of cash used in our operations and any unforeseen cash needs.
Therefore, our actual expenditures may differ materially from the estimates
described above. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds
for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds.

facility for which we have entered into a letter of intent to purchase, and debt
service payments into the fourth quarter of 2020.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds
to be received upon the closing of this offering. Due to uncertainties inherent
in the product development process, it is difficult to estimate the exact
amounts of the net proceeds that will be used for any particular purpose. We may
use our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our
operations, any of which may alter the amount of net proceeds used for a
particular purpose. In addition, the amount, allocation and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our
research and development efforts, the timing and success of clinical trials and
the timing of regulatory submissions. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion
in using these proceeds. Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds
from this offering in short- and immediate-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government.

The expected net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities, will not be sufficient for us to
fund any of our product candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need
to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of
our product candidates. We expect to finance our cash needs through a
combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential collaborations,
license and development agreements. We could expend our available capital
resources at a rate greater than we currently expect."

(1) A portion of these expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans made
    to us by our officers and directors. These loans will be repaid upon the 
    earlier of the completion of this offering, October 18, 2018 or the date we
    abandon this offering. If offering expenses actually paid are less than the
    estimates set forth in this table, the balance will be used for post-closing
    working capital.

(2) Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed to defer until consummation of our initial
    business combination $4.55 million of underwriting commissions (or 
    approximately $5.623 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is
    exercised in full), which equals 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the units 
    sold to the public, excluding any units purchased pursuant to the 
    underwriters’ overallotment option, and 5.5% of the gross proceeds from the
    units sold to the public pursuant to the underwriters’ overallotment option.
    Upon consummation of our initial business combination, the deferred 
    commissions will be paid to Cantor Fitzgerald from the funds held in the 
    trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be 
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, 
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital.

(3) $130.0 million from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement
    ($149.5 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in
    full), including deferred underwriting commissions of $4.55 million 
    (approximately $5.623 million if the underwriters exercise their 
    overallotment option in full), will be placed in a trust account located in
    the United States, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting
    as trustee.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    If we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to 
    industry specific regulation, we may incur additional expenses associated 
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary, and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes the up to $125,000 on an annual basis, of interest earned on the
    trust account for working capital purposes to pay our Nasdaq continued 
    listing fees, auditor fees and trust/custodian administration fees.

A total of $130.0 million (or $149.5 million if the underwriters’ overallotment
option is exercised in full) of the aggregate net proceeds from this offering
and the private placement, including $4.55 million (or approximately $5.623
million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full) of the
deferred underwriting discount, will be placed in a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 180
days or less or in money market funds investing solely in United States
Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act. Except for any interest income released to us to pay our franchise
and income taxes and up to $125,000 on an annual basis for working capital
purposesdescribed above, none of the funds held in the trust account will be
released, subject to the requirements of law, until the earlier of (i) the
consummation of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of our
public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 18
months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ overallotment option), subject to applicable law; (iii) the
redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months
from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our liquidation or
if our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases to
pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of the
18 month period (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust
account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment,
that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify an attractive
business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal
requirements to consummate a business combination).

The net proceeds held in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting
commissions) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. If we pay for
our initial business combination using stock or debt securities, or if we do not
use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase
price in connection with our business combination, we may use the remaining cash
released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for
maintenance or expansion of the operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement
held out of trust and interest income on the amount in the trust account that
may be released to fund working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay
our costs and expenses prior to our initial business combination. This belief is
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target
business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake
in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant
prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of 
intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business 
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due 
diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

The payment to Crescendo Advisors II, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. 
Rosenfeld, of a monthly fee of $12,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and administrative support. This
arrangement is being agreed to by Crescendo Advisors II, LLC for our benefit and
is not intended to provide Mr. Rosenfeld or our other executive officers with
compensation in lieu of salaries. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in New York City, that the fee charged by Crescendo Advisors
II, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated
person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders.
Other than the $12,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates prior to, or for
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering
in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However,
in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
business combination, our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their
affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. In
the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a
portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such
repayment. Such loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would
either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without
interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,000,000 of the notes may be
converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional
placement units at a price of $10.00 per unit.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our initial holders, directors, officers or their
respective affiliates may purchase shares in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our
initial business combination, although as of the date of this prospectus (apart
from the purchase of the placement units) they have no commitments, plans or
intentions to engage in such transactions. If they do effect such purchases, we
anticipate that they would approach a limited number of large holders of our
securities that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption
of their shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in
direct negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions. All holders
approached in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There
is no limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our initial holders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not
disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under
the Exchange Act or in transactions that would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule
10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act. Although they do not currently anticipate paying
any premium purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the
price they may pay. They may also enter into transactions to provide such
holders with incentives to acquire shares, vote their shares in favor of an
initial business combination or not redeem their share. We will notify
stockholders of such material purchases or arrangements that would affect the
vote on an initial business combination, if any, by press release, filing a Form
8-K or by means of a supplement to our proxy statement. No funds in the trust
account may be used to effect purchases of shares in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination. Moreover, the redemption threshold may be further limited
by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If the amount
of redemptions plus any cash required by our initial business combination would
cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,000, we would not proceed 
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and 
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 18 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option),
subject to applicable law; (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 18 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any
exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our
liquidation or in the event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the
trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination
prior to the expiration of the 18 month period (our board of directors may
determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it
determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining
time that we will be able to identify an attractive acquisition target or
satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a
business combination). In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

The initial holders, Cantor Fitzgerald and Chardan have agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares (i)
in connection with the consummation of a business combination, (ii) in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 18 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of
the underwriters’ overallotment option) and (iii) if we fail to consummate a
business combination within the 18 month period or if we liquidate prior to the
expiration of the 18 month period. The initial holders have also agreed to waive
their redemption rights with respect to public shares in connection with the
consummation of a business combination or a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within the 18 month period. However,
if the initial holders, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates,
acquires public shares, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect
to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination
or liquidate within the required time period. In addition, Cantor Fitzgerald and
Chardan will have the same redemption rights as a public stockholder with
respect to any public shares they acquire."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds loaned to
    us by our sponsor. These funds are currently due on demand and will be
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.
 
(2) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 2.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $1,000,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s
    deferred commissions (or up to $1,150,000 if the underwriter’s
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter
    from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining funds will be
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase
    price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. No
    discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) Upon closing of the initial business combination, the funds held in the
    trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our expenses relating to
    acquiring a target business.

(4) Does not include any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
    that may be available to us as described in this prospectus.

A total of  $40,000,000 (or $46,000,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private units described in this prospectus will be placed in a trust
account in the United States at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, subject to
increase in the event that our sponsor elects to extend the period of time to
consummate a business combination, and will be invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act and which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for all interest
income that may be released to us to pay taxes, and up to $50,000 to pay
dissolution expenses, as discussed below, none of the funds held in the trust 
account will be released from the trust account until the earlier of: (1) the
completion of our initial business combination within the required time period;
(2) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not
completed an initial business combination in the required time period; and
(3) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
shareholder vote to amend our memorandum and articles of association (A) to
modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the
required time period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our sponsor or an affiliate of
our sponsor or our officers and directors, but such members of our management
team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq, we have
agreed to pay an affiliate of a member of our sponsor a total of  $10,000 per
month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services.
Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will
cease paying these monthly fees.

As of June 11, 2018, our sponsor has loaned us a total of  $126,350 to be used
for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest
bearing and unsecured. The loan is due on the earlier of December 31, 2018 or
the date on which we consummate the offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such notes may be convertible into additional private units at a price of $10.00
per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000
ordinary shares if  $1,500,000 of notes were so converted (including 15,000
shares upon the closing of our initial business combination in respect of 
150,000 rights included in such units), as well as 150,000 warrants to purchase
75,000 shares).

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be
further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination.
If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate
our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of this
offering (or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the
period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail
in this prospectus), or (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection
with a shareholder vote to amend our memorandum and articles of association (A)
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months
from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months from the closing of this
offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination,
as described in more detail in this prospectus) or (B) with respect to any other
provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity,
subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares, private shares and shares underlying private
rights and private warrants in connection with the consummation of our initial
business combination. Our initial shareholders have also agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to any public shares purchased during or after
the offering in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their
rights to liquidating distributions with respect to its founder shares and
private shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within
12 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months from the closing
of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business
combination, as described in more detail in this prospectus). However, if our
initial shareholders acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will
be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public
shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the
required time period. Our initial shareholders have also agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and
public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) to modify the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 21
months) from the closing of this offering or (b) with respect to any other
provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination
activity."

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $150,000,000 (or $172,500,000
    if the overallotment option is exercised in full) as well as amounts payable
    to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with 
    our successful completion of our initial business combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    June 30, 2018, we had drawn $106,225 (of up to $300,000 available to us)
    under the amended and restated promissory note with our sponsor and owed
    another $32,726 that had been advanced by our Executive Chairman. Any
    amounts subsequently incurred will be repaid upon completion of this
    offering out of the offering proceeds that have been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions). In the
    event that offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, they
    will be repaid using a portion of the $1,460,000 of offering proceeds not
    held in the trust account and set aside for post-closing working capital
    expenses. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital
    expenses.

(3) Includes 2% in the aggregate payable as commissions to the underwriters upon
    consummation of this offering and 1% in the aggregate payable to the
    underwriters solely on units sold as part of the overallotment option upon
    its exercise. The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions
    equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our
    initial business combination, $6,000,000, which constitutes Chardan’s 
    deferred commissions (or $6,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to Chardan from the funds held in
    the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to the
    trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. Chardan 
    will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting
    discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.

(5) Represents the first year of payments to an entity affiliated with our
    President as well as a bonus payment of $78,000 upon successful consummation
    of this offering.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $151,500,000 (or $174,225,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $6,000,000 (or $6,900,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $1,950,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 1.3% per year; however, we can provide no assurance
regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 21
months from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other
provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination
activity, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of
this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an entity
affiliated with our sponsor a total of $2,000 per month for office space,
utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our
initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of June
30, 2018, we had drawn $106,225 (of up to $300,000 available to us) under the
amended and restated promissory note with our sponsor and owed another $32,726
that had been advanced by our Executive Chairman. These loans are non-interest
bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2018 or the
closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the offering proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination. See “Proposed Business — Permitted purchases
of our securities” for a description of how our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which
stockholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 21 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

approximately $17.3 million (or approximately $20.2 million if the underwriters’
option to purchase additional units from us is exercised in full) based on the
initial public offering price of $6.125 per unit, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows: (1) $10.0
million towards expanding our commercial operations to grow and support the
installed base of our products among life sciences basic research, translational
research and clinical-related customers in the U.S. and internationally; (2)
$4.0 million towards improving and updating our technology and instruments and
towards developing additional labeling reagents; (3) $0.5 million towards
potentially establishing a direct commercialization presence in China; (4) $0.5
million towards assisting existing and future partners in pursuing regulatory
approvals or clearances to develop instruments and consumables in areas outside
of life science research, including potentially LDTs; and (5) the remainder to
fund working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We also may use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund
acquisitions or other business development opportunities. However, we have no
current commitments or obligations with respect to any such acquisitions or
business development opportunities at this time.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly, we
will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering.
The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business.
Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in a
variety of capital-preservation investments, including short-and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities and government
securities."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds advanced
    to us by Mr. Nayar, our Chief Executive Officer. These funds are currently 
    due on demand and will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering 
    available to us.

(2) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $1,925,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $2,213,750 if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. Up to $0.10 per unit (or up to $550,000) of the deferred
    underwriting commissions (or up to $632,500, depending upon the extent to
    which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised) may be paid,
    solely at the discretion of our management team, to third parties not 
    participating in this offering, that assist us in consummating our initial
    business combination. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. No discounts
    or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the private
    units.

(3) Upon closing of the initial business combination, the funds held in the 
    trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our expenses relating to 
    acquiring a target business.

(4) Does not include any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
    that may be available to us as described in this prospectus. Based upon
    current interest rates, we expect the trust account to generate
    approximately $550,000 of interest income annually that would be available
    to us for taxes.

A total of  $56,100,000 (or $64,515,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private units described in this prospectus will be placed in a trust
account in the United States at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S.
Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may be released to us to pay
taxes, and up to $50,000 to pay dissolution expenses, as discussed below, none
of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust account
until the earlier of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination
within the required time period; (2) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding
public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination in the
required time period; and (3) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within the required time period or (B) with respect
to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business
combination activity.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our sponsor or an affiliate of
our sponsor or our officers and directors, but such members of our management
team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

As of the date of this prospectus, Mr. Nayar, our Chief Executive Officer, has
advanced to us a total of $112,765 to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing and unsecured and due on
demand.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such notes may be convertible into additional private units at a price of 
$10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued
150,000 ordinary shares if  $1,500,000 of notes were so converted as well as
150,000 warrants to purchase 150,000 shares).

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be
further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination.
If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate
our initial business combination within 18 months following the closing of this
offering or (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection with a
shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 18 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any
other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination
activity, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares and private shares in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination. Our initial shareholders have
also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any public shares
purchased during or after the offering in connection with the consummation of
our initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have
agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions with respect to its
founder shares and private shares if we fail to consummate our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our
initial shareholders acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will
be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public
shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the
required time period."

of 510,438 ADSs, 510,438 Series A warrants to purchase up to 765,657 ADSs and
510,438 Series B warrants which may entitle the holders thereof to purchase up
to an additional 1,191,021 ADSs, offered by us in this offering (approximately
$6.922 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full), based upon the public offering price of $14.35 per ADS and $0.01 per
warrant.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following
purposes:

. Approximately $1.7 million for scaling up marketing and sales of our products
  in the United States including brand creation and enhancing our dedicated
  marketing and sales activities in the United states;

. Approximately $1.7 million for scaling up marketing and sales of our products
  in the rest of the world;

. Approximately $1.7 million for research and development of new technologies to
  expand our business; and

. The remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

If the Series A warrants and Series B warrants issued to investors in this
offering are exercised in full (including Series A warrants and Series B
warrants issued pursuant to the underwriter’s over-allotment option), we will
receive an additional $12,635,247 in gross proceeds. Changing circumstances may
cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the progress of our global marketing and sales efforts, the
development efforts and the overall economic environment. Therefore, our
management will retain broad discretion over the use of the proceeds from this
offering. We may ultimately use the proceeds for different purposes than what we
currently intend. Pending any ultimate use of any portion of the proceeds from
this offering, if the anticipated proceeds will not be sufficient to fund all
the proposed purposes, our management will determine the order of priority for
using the proceeds, as well as the amount and sources of other funds needed.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we may invest the net
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government securities."

    in the trust account or additional funds otherwise available to us outside
    of the trust account, including cash held by the target business. Any
    remaining funds will be disbursed to the combined company and be used as
    working capital to finance the operations of the target business.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $850,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Symphony has agreed to, through an affiliate, purchase an aggregate of
11,800,000 private warrants at a price of $0.50 per private warrant ($5,900,000
in the aggregate) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the
closing of this offering. It has further agreed that if the over-allotment
option is exercised by the underwriters, it will, through an affiliate, purchase
from us at a price of $0.50 per private warrant an additional number of private
warrants (up to a maximum of 1,320,000 private warrants) pro rata with the
amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least $10.00 per share
sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless of whether the
over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These additional private
warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously
with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment
option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in
the trust account described below.

$220,000,000, or $253,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants will
be placed in an account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. Pursuant to the investment management trust agreement that will govern
the investment of such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will
direct JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to invest the funds as set forth in such
written instructions and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise
instructed in accordance with the investment management trust agreement. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or
other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

We will be obligated, commencing on the date of this prospectus, to pay TKK
Capital Holding, an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer, a monthly fee of
an aggregate of $15,000 for general and administrative services including office
space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public shareholders. Other than the $15,000 per month fee and the
repayment of loans from our sponsor (none of which payments will be made from
the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion
of our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$850,000. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto. If the
payment of our liabilities, including the fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal
to 3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any
applicable finders’ fees which might become payable), were to reduce the amount
available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or
sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we
would not be able to consummate such transaction. To the extent that our share
capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to
consummate a business combination, to pay holders who wish to convert their
shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses
relating thereto (which could include the up to $8,855,000 payable to
EarlyBirdCapital described above if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full) will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other
net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations
of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of
ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for
strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing
or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, TKK Capital Holding has
agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $20,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of June 30, 2018, our sponsor had loaned to us an aggregate of $227,241 to be
used to pay formation and a portion of the expenses of this offering. The loan
is payable without interest on the earlier of December 31, 2018 or the date on
which we consummate our initial public offering. In addition, as of June 30,
2018, TKK Capital Holding advanced us an aggregate of $12,755 to be used to pay
formation and a portion of the expenses of this offering. The advance is payable
without interest on demand. If we determine not to proceed with the offering,
such amounts would not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,000,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into warrants at a price of $0.50
per warrant (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued
warrants to acquire 1,000,000 ordinary shares if $1,000,000 of notes were so
converted). The warrants would be identical to the private warrants. In the
event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion
of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned
amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such
repayment.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such public shares or
sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection with a business
combination which we consummate or in connection with an amendment to our
memorandum and articles of association prior to the consummation of an initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $23.4 million,
based on an initial public offering price of $13.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$27.0 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds to fund our planned clinical trials,
manufacturing and process development, analytical testing, regulatory expenses
and for general corporate purposes, including working capital. We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $14.0 million for the planned Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating
  AR-301 for the treatment of HAP and VAP associated with S. aureus infection;

. approximately $6.0 million for the ongoing Phase 2 trial evaluating AR-105 for
  the treatment of HAP and VAP associated with P. aeruginosa infection;

. approximately $0.5 million for the manufacturing of clinical supplies of
  AR-101 for use in the planned Phase 2/3 pivotal trial evaluating AR-101 for
  the treatment of HAP and VAP associated with P. aeruginosa infection;

. approximately $2.0 million for non-reimbursed AR-501 Phase 1/2a clinical trial
  expenses; and

. the remainder for general corporate purposes, including working capital and
  regulatory expenses;

We expect that the application of the proceeds to each of the activities as
described above will be sufficient to complete such activities, but there can be
no guarantee that we will not require additional funds to complete the
activities or that, even if we do receive additional funds, that we will be able
to complete the trials at all.

In the ordinary course of our business, we expect to from time to time evaluate
the acquisition of, investment in or in-license of complementary products,
technologies or businesses, and we could use a portion of the net proceeds from
this offering for such activities. We currently do not have any agreements,
arrangements or commitments with respect to any potential acquisition,
investment or license.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the status of and results from clinical trials of our product
candidates. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or
advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and we
will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this
offering. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will need to secure additional
funding for the further development of our product candidates or commercially
launch our product candidates in the United States.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

$104.9 million, or approximately $113.6 million if the overallotment option is
exercised in full, based on the initial public offering price of $12.00 per
share, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable.

Pursuant to an overallotment option, we and the selling shareholders have
offered an aggregate of up to 1,444,500 shares of our common stock for sale in
this offering. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the
selling shareholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to: (i) repay all
outstanding indebtedness under our CIT Revolving Credit Facility in the amount
of $25.7 million; (ii) repay from $20.0 to $40.0 million of existing
indebtedness under our Spare Engine Facility and the Subordinated GECAS Notes;
and (iii) in connection with the repayment, refinance the remaining portion of
indebtedness under our Spare Engine Facility and the Subordinated GECAS Notes.
Our CIT Revolving Credit Facility permits revolving borrowings of up to $35.0
million and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.25%. Following our
repayment of funds drawn under our CIT Revolving Credit Facility, the
$35.0 million commitment amount will remain available for future borrowing
through the maturity date of August 12, 2019. As of March 31, 2018, $92.3
million of borrowings were outstanding under our Spare Engine Facility. Funds
drawn under this facility bear interest at the rate of 7.25% per annum plus the
greater of (a) 0.5% or (b) the Eurodollar rate. There are four tranches of debt
under our Spare Engine Facility, which mature between January 2022 and February
2023. As of June 28, 2018, the date of issuance, we had an aggregate of $29.4
million of borrowings outstanding under our Subordinated GECAS Notes, each of
which bear interest at LIBOR plus 7.50% and mature on February 1, 2022. We can
give no assurance that we will be able to refinance the Spare Engine Facility or
the Subordinated GECAS Notes at acceptable rates, on acceptable terms, or at
all. Imperial Capital, LLC or its affiliates may receive a restructuring fee in
connection with our repayment of debt.

We intend to use any remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which
may include the repayment of other indebtedness, working capital and capital
expenditures, including flight equipment acquisitions and lease buyouts.
Currently, we do not know the amounts that we intend to use for each of these
general corporate activities. Accordingly, our management will have broad
discretion over the uses of the net proceeds in this offering.

We have presented pro forma data in this prospectus that give effect to our
application of the net proceeds from this offering. These pro forma adjustments
have been made based on available information and assumptions that we believe
are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma basis, the impact of these
transactions on our historical financial information. The assumptions underlying
the pro forma data related to our anticipated use of proceeds are set forth
below:

• We will repay all outstanding indebtedness under our CIT Revolving Credit 
  Facility in the amount of $25.7 million;                                  

• We will repay $30 million of existing indebtedness under our Spare Engine 
  Facility and the Subordinated GECAS Notes (which is the mid-point of the $20.0
  to $40.0 million estimated repayment range set forth above) as part of a 
  refinancing transaction; and                                         

• We will refinance the remaining portion of indebtedness under our Spare   
  Engine Facility and the Subordinated GECAS Notes, reducing the applicable 
  interest rate from LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 7.25% to 7.50% to LIBOR 
  plus 4.0%.                                                          

The pro forma data, adjustments and underlying assumptions are presented for
illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily indicate our future results of
operations. We urge you to read the pro forma data in conjunction with our

information included elsewhere in this prospectus."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. These 
    loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $1,000,000
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses (other than underwriting discounts and commissions). In the event 
    that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such 
    amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event
    that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may
    fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting discounts and commissions
    equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our
    initial business combination, $16,800,000, which constitutes the 
    underwriters’ deferred underwriting discounts and commissions (or 
    $19,320,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
    will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, 
    and the remaining funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay 
    redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or
    a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, 
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in 
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of 
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be 
    entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
    treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account 
    will be approximately $4.8 million per year, assuming an interest rate of 
    1% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
$480,000,000 (or $552,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including $16,800,000 (or $19,320,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions, will be deposited into a U.S. based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, and $12,600,000, (or $14,040,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), will be used to pay expenses in connection with
the closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering.
The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government
treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$4.8 million per year, assuming an interest rate of 1% per year; however, we can
provide no assurances regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay
our franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and
the sale of the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust
account until the earliest to occur of (a) the completion of our initial
business combination (including the release of funds to pay any amounts due to
any public stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights in
connection therewith), (b) the redemption of any public shares properly
submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
do not complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering or (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we
expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes, will
be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans
in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to 
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek 
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or 
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any 
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance 
funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse our sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial support
and administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an
amount equal to $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the closing of this offering.
The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering as part of the
estimated $1,000,000 of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise
price, exercisability and exercise period. Except as set forth above, the terms
of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist
with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business
combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor
or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account.

We have entered into a Forward Purchase Agreement pursuant to which ANRP II,
which is a private investment fund managed by Apollo, agreed to purchase an
aggregate of up to 30,000,000 Forward Purchase Units, consisting of the Forward
Purchase Shares and the Forward Purchase Warrants, for $10.00 per unit, or an
aggregate maximum amount of $300,000,000, in a private placement that will close
simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination. ANRP II
will purchase a number of Forward Purchase Units that will result in gross
proceeds to us necessary to enable us to consummate our initial business
combination and pay related fees and expenses, after first applying amounts
available to us from the trust account (after paying the deferred underwriting
discount and giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other
financing source obtained by us for such purpose at or prior to the consummation
of our initial business combination, plus any additional amounts mutually agreed
by us and ANRP II to be retained by the post-business combination company for
working capital or other purposes.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and the rules of the NYSE. However, they have no
current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have
not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage
in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
Subsequent to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt an insider
trading policy which will require insiders to: (1) refrain from purchasing
securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of
any material non-public information; and (2) to clear all trades with our legal
counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders
will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent
upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such
purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such 
purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not 
necessary.

We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a
tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the redemption of any public shares
properly submitted in connection with our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing
of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated
an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering or (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

this offering will be approximately $34.8 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $12.00 per share, and after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be $40.4 million based on the initial public offering price of
$12.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We currently expect
to use net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes:

• approximately $5 million to fund development of VX15 as a combination     
  therapy with avelumab in patients with NSCLC who have not previously been 
  treated with immunotherapy, which includes funding through the primary    
  completion date of the CLASSICAL–Lung clinical trial that we initiated in 
  October 2017;                                                             

• approximately $25 million to fund development of VX15 as a therapy in     
  Huntington’s disease through the end of 2019;                             

• approximately $3 million to fund continued preclinical research using our 
  platform technologies;                                                    

• approximately $1.8 million to repay the June 2016 Note in full, including $0.3
  million in accrued interest, assuming the note was repaid on July 20, 2018; 
  and                                                                 

• the remainder, if any, for working capital and general corporate purposes,
  including but not limited to support of Biocon’s trial of BVX20 in MS and 
  exploratory studies or ISTs of the application of VX15 in other           
  indications.                                                              

We intend to use part of the net proceeds from this offering to repay the June
2016 Note and accrued interest in full. The June 2016 Note accrues interest at a
compounded annual rate of 8% and has a maturity date three years from issuance,
if not converted before then. The June 2016 Note is held by a related party,
Vaccinex LLC, which is majority owned and controlled by Dr. Maurice Zauderer,
our President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors.
Upon the occurrence of a default event, such as payment or performance defaults,
bankruptcy, change in control (if elected to be treated as such by the lenders),
or other violation, the interest rate would increase to a compounded annual rate
of 12% until such time the default is cured.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
progress of our preclinical and clinical development efforts and any unforeseen
cash needs. As a result, our management will have broad discretion over the use
of the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors. Pending the uses described
above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and
cash equivalents, will fund our operations until the end of 2019."

underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$43.2 million (or approximately $49.8 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares from us in full).

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering for general
corporate purposes, which could include a contribution of capital to the Bank to
support balance sheet growth and to provide additional capital as a cushion
against minimum regulatory capital requirements, in addition to future organic
growth and other strategic initiatives. We do not have any current specific plan
for such net proceeds, and do not have any current plans, arrangements or
understandings to make any material acquisitions or to establish any de novo
bank branches. Our management will retain broad discretion to allocate the net
proceeds of this offering. The precise amounts and timing of our use of the
proceeds will depend upon market conditions, among other factors."

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $200,000,000 (or $230,000,000
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full).

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    May 22, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts (of up to $300,000 available
    to us) under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion
    of the expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon
    completion of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that
    has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than
    underwriting commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than
    as set forth in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the
    $1,800,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside
    for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $7,000,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s
    deferred commissions (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
units, $200,000,000 (or $230,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full), including $7,000,000 (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting
commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $2,000,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 1.0% per year; however, we can provide no assurance regarding
this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement units will not be released from the trust account until the earliest
to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the
redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18
months from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other
provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination
activity, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of
this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of May
22, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts under the promissory note with our
sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is
non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of December 31, 2018 or
the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the offering proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,200,000 of
such working capital loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent
units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. Such units
would be identical to the private placement units, including as to exercise
price, exercisability and exercise period of the underlying warrants. The terms
of such working capital loans by our sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers
and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist
with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and private placement shares and any public shares
held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business
combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their
rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any
founder shares or private placement shares held by them if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if
our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

that we are offering will be approximately $75.2 million, based on the initial
public offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters’ over-allotmentoption is exercised in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $87.1 million. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling
stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, create
a public market for our common stock, facilitate our future access to the public
equity markets, increase awareness of our company among potential customers and
improve our competitive position. We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may
include sales and marketing activities, research, product development, general
and administrative matters and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion
of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary
businesses, products, services, technologies or assets. However, we have no
current understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any such
acquisitions or make any such investments.

We have not yet determined our anticipated expenditures and therefore cannot
estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above. The
amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash
generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the
rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have
significant discretion and flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this
offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of these net proceeds.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    borrowed from our sponsor, Norwich Investment Limited described below. These
    funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.
    If we determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would not be
    repaid.                                             

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.                                                       

(3) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to Chardan Capital
    Markets, LLC in an amount of up to 4.0% of the total gross proceeds raised
    in the offering described below.                   

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $500,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.                                 

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital. 

Our sponsor has agreed to purchase an aggregate of 200,000 private units at a
price of $10.00 per private unit ($2,000,000 in the aggregate) in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our
sponsor has further agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the
underwriters, it will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per private unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 15,000 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least
$10.00 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless
of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These
additional private units will be purchased in a private placement that will
occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of
the over-allotment option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account described below.

$40,000,000, or $46,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at Morgan Stanley in the United States, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Pursuant to the investment management trust agreement that will govern the
investment of such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will
direct Morgan Stanley to invest the funds as set forth in such written
instructions and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise
instructed in accordance with the investment management trust agreement. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or
other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination to the extent not used to pay converting shareholders. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Norwich Investment Limited, a company owned by our insiders, of a
monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. However, pursuant to the terms
of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination
by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to
pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business
combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and
payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business
combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by Norwich Investment Limited
for our benefit. We believe that the fee charged by Norwich Investment Limited
is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.
This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public shareholders.
Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto. If the
payment of our liabilities, including the deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC in an amount up to 4.0% of
the total gross proceeds raised in the offering, were to reduce the amount
available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or
sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we
would not be able to consummate such transaction. To the extent that our share
capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to
consummate a business combination, to pay holders who wish to convert their
shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses
relating thereto will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with
any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Norwich Investment Limited,
our sponsor, has agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such
liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than $18,500) and has agreed
not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of March 31, 2018, our sponsor had loaned to us an aggregate of $161,341 to
be used to pay formation and a portion of the expenses of this offering. The
loan is payable without interest on the date on which we consummate our initial
public offering. If we determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts
would not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into private units at a price of
$10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued
units to acquire 55,000 ordinary shares (which includes 5,000 shares issuable
upon conversion of rights) and warrants to purchase 25,000 ordinary shares if
$500,000 of notes were so converted). If we do not complete our initial business
combination, the loans would be repaid out of funds not held in the trust
account, and only to the extent available.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination
within the required time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such
public shares or sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection
with a business combination which we consummate or in connection with an
amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
prior to the consummation of an initial business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

offered by us will be approximately $715.4 million, or approximately $823.9 
million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares 
in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses 
payable by us of approximately $49.6 million.

We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of 10,212,677 ordinary shares
offered by us in the Concurrent Private Placement will be approximately $164.9
million, or approximately $170.6 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full, after deducting fees payable in

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement as follows:

. approximately $470.0 million to reduce outstanding indebtedness, in particular
  to repay our Second Lien Loan, which matures on November 4, 2022 and had a 
  weighted average effective interest rate of 8.87% as of December 31, 2017;

approximately US$45.1 million, or approximately US$52.4 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• Approximately US$15.0 million for research and development, to continue to
  invest in our technological capabilities, particularly big data analytics and
  AI technology, and to develop new products and services;

• Approximately US$15.0 million for sales and marketing efforts, including
  promotional activities for our products to acquire users; and

• the balance for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital
  needs, and potential strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to our VIEs only

approval requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $90.0 million at the initial
public offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting

estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $104.0 million at the
initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as follows:

• approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million to fund our planned Phase 1/2
  clinical trial of GRANITE-001;

• approximately $15.0 million to $18.0 million to fund the continued buildout of
  our manufacturing facility, including the purchase of capital equipment, the
  design and construction of additional cGMP manufacturing and testing
  capabilities, and infrastructure upgrades and buildout to facilitate increased
  manufacturing capacity and internalize production of additional steps in the
  manufacturing of both our GRANITE and SLATE programs that are currently
  outsourced;

• approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million to fund internal research and
  development activities, including preclinical and IND-enabling activities for
  SLATE-001; and

• the balance for working capital and general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds and our existing cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities to in-license, acquire, or invest in
complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets. However, we have no
current commitments or obligations to do so.

Due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory
approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts
of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes.
As such, our management will retain broad discretion over the use of the net
proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors, including: (i) the time and cost necessary to
advance GRANITE-001 through our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial and future
clinical trials; (ii) the timing of scaling our manufacturing capabilities and
internalizing certain of our manufacturing processes; (iii) the time and cost
associated with our research and development activities; and (iv) our ability to
obtain regulatory approval for and subsequently commercialize GRANITE-001,
SLATE-001 and any other future product candidates.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,
together with the net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund
our planned operations for at least 12 months following the date of this
offering and through preliminary efficacy data for our planned Phase 1/2
clinical trial for GRANITE-001. After this offering, we will require substantial
capital in order to advance GRANITE-001, SLATE-001 and any other future product
candidates through pivotal clinical trials, regulatory approval and
commercialization.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities."

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries through loans or additional capital contributions and to our VIEs
only through loans, subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements. Currently, there is no statutory limit
to the amount of funding that we can provide to our PRC subsidiaries through
capital contributions. However, the maximum amount we can loan to our PRC
subsidiaries and VIEs is subject to statutory limits. According to current PRC
laws and regulations, we can provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries through
loans of up to either (i) the amount of the difference between the respective
registered total investment amount and registered capital of each of our PRC
subsidiaries, or the Total Investment and Registered Capital Balance, or (ii)
two times, or the then applicable statutory multiple, the amount of their
respective net assets, calculated in accordance with PRC GAAP, or the Net Assets
Limit, at our election. We may also fund our VIEs through cross-border loans and
the maximum amount would be their respective Net Assets Limit. Increasing the
Total Investment and Registered Capital Balance of our PRC subsidiaries is
subject to governmental procedures and may require a PRC subsidiary to increase
its registered capital at the same time. If we choose to make a loan to a PRC
entity based on its Net Assets Limit, the maximum amount we would be able to
loan to the relevant PRC entity would depend on the relevant entity’s net assets
and the applicable statutory multiple at the time of calculation. As of the date
of this prospectus, the maximum amount we may loan to our PRC subsidiaries and
VIEs in aggregate is US$60 million, as only Yuguan has a positive Total
Investment and Registered Capital Balance of US$60 million, and all of our PRC
subsidiaries and VIEs have negative or very limited net assets, which prevents
us from providing loans to them using the Net Assets Limit. PRC laws and
regulations may also impose more stringent limitations to cross-border loans,
which will also have negative impact on our ability to fund our PRC entities. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations
or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

private placement represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. The amounts we actually expend in these areas, and the
timing thereof, may vary significantly from our current intentions and will
depend on a number of factors, including the success of research and product
development efforts, cash generated from future operations and actual expenses
to operate our business. We may use a portion of the net proceeds for the
acquisition of, or investment in, businesses that complement our business,
although we have no present commitments or agreements.

The amounts and timing of our clinical expenditures and the extent of clinical
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
status, results and timing of our current preclinical studies and clinical
trials and those which we may commence in the future, the product approval
process with the FDA and other regulatory agencies, our current collaborations
and any new collaborations we may enter into with third parties and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, we cannot predict with any certainty all of
the particular uses for the net proceeds or the amounts that we will actually
spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly, our management will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying
on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds
of this offering and the concurrent private placement.

The expected net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement
will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our product candidates through
regulatory approval, and we will need to raise substantial additional capital to
complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement in short term, investment-grade
interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of
deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $108.5 million, based
on the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
shares, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be
approximately $125.2 million.

As of June 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of
approximately $99.7 million. We currently estimate that we will use the net
proceeds from this offering, together with our cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities, as follows:

• approximately $29.0 million to $34.0 million for the advancement of our AR
  program, including completion of our IND submissions, completion of our Phase
  1 dose-escalation clinical trial of ARV-110 in men with progressive mCRPC,
  conducting an expansion cohort from this trial, and conducting IND-enabling
  studies of a next generation AR degrader for men with mCRPC;

• approximately $20.0 million to $23.0 million for the advancement of our ER
  program, including completion of our IND submissions, completion of our Phase
  1 dose-escalation clinical trial of ARV-471 in women with locally advanced or
  metastatic ER+ breast cancer, enrolling an expansion cohort from this trial,
  and initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial of ARV-471 in combination with a
  CDK4/6 inhibitor; and                              

• the remainder for the continued expansion of our platform technology,
  preclinical studies for research stage programs, working capital and other
  general corporate purposes.                                             

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities represents our intentions based upon
our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development and commercialization efforts, the status of and
results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter
into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current
agreements, commitments or understandings for any material acquisitions or
licenses of any products, businesses or technologies.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, we estimate that such funds
will be sufficient to enable us to complete our Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical
trials of both ARV-110 and ARV-471, enroll patients in the expansion cohorts for
the ARV-110 and ARV-471 Phase 1 trials, initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial for
ARV-471 in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and complete IND-enabling studies
of a next generation AR degrader. We have based this estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources
sooner than we currently expect. The net proceeds from this offering and our
existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may not be sufficient
to allow us to complete the treatment of patients in the expansion cohorts from
our Phase 1 trials for ARV-110 and ARV-471 or complete a Phase 1b clinical trial
for ARV-471 in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

$147.4 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
common shares in full, based on the initial public offering price of $14.00 per
common share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes:

• approximately $38.0 million to $42.0 million to complete our international 
  Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial for vibegron in patients with OAB; 

• approximately $22.0 million to $26.0 million to advance through completion of 
  site activation and initiation of patient enrollment both our planned Phase 3 
  clinical trial for vibegron for the treatment of OAB in men with BPH and our
  planned Phase 2a clinical trial for vibegron in patients with IBS-associated
  pain; 

• approximately $4.0 million to $7.0 million to advance through completion of 
  site activation and initiation of patient enrollment our planned Phase 2a
  clinical trial for hMaxi-K for the treatment of OAB in patients who have not
  responded to oral pharmacological therapies; and 

• the remainder to fund working capital, commercial readiness and general 
  corporate purposes, which may include research and development of vibegron for
  other indications.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2020, as well as to complete
our international Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial for vibegron in patients with OAB. We
have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we
could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Even
with the net proceeds from this offering, we will require additional capital to
complete the development and potential commercialization of vibegron and hMaxi-K
in each of the indications set forth above, the amounts of which will depend on
the ultimate commercialization plans and clinical development paths we pursue.
Until such time, if ever, that we can generate substantial product revenue, we
expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt
financings, strategic alliances and license and development agreements or other
collaborations.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on
numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the status of and
results from preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties, and any unforeseen
cash needs.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through the acquisition or in-license of complementary product
candidates. While we have no current agreements or commitments for any specific
acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion of the net
proceeds for these purposes.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. The
timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business.
We may choose to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States. The goal with respect to the
investment of these net proceeds is capital preservation and liquidity so that
such funds are readily available to fund our operations."

As of June 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $33.6 million. We 
currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, 
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $50.0 million to fund the advancement of ETX2514SUL through a
  Phase 3 clinical trial;

• approximately $3.0 million to fund the advancement of ETX0282CPDP through a
  multi-part Phase 1 clinical trial;

• approximately $14.0 million to fund our NBP development program, including the
  selection of an initial clinical candidate and advancing it through a Phase 1
  clinical trial; and

• the remainder to fund other research and development activities, working
  capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds from this offering to 
in-license, acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, 
products or assets. However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do
so.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based on our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. For example, we currently 
expect that our advancement of ETX0282CPDP through a multi-part Phase 1 clinical
trial and the selection of an initial clinical candidate from our NBP
development program and its advancement through a Phase 1 clinical trial will be
funded, in part, by our two awards from CARB-X, under which we have received 
aggregate financial commitments of up to $16.4 million. However, the CARB-X 
awards are based on estimates of development costs that we have made that may
prove to be wrong, and the funding we receive under these awards may not be 
sufficient to cover our actual costs. In addition, some of the potential funding
under our CARB-X awards is subject to the achievement of pre-specified
milestones, which we may not achieve. These pre-specified milestones include the
completion of important steps for a development-stage project such as
preclinical studies or clinical trials, manufacture and formulation work,
submission of regulatory applications and regulatory meetings with the FDA or
comparable foreign regulator. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures
may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of
our development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product

payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital to fund our
growth strategy. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately US$30.7 million for research and development of products,

• approximately US$30.7 million for selling and marketing initiatives;

• approximately US$25.5 million for potential strategic investments and

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to our VIEs only
through loans, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and
approval requirements. Currently, there is no statutory limit to the amount of
funding that we can provide to our PRC subsidiary through capital contribution,
and we can provide loans to our PRC subsidiary, VIEs and their subsidiaries as
long as the loan amount does not exceed the statutory limit, which is currently
twice the amount of the relevant entities' respective net assets, calculated in
accordance with accounting standards in China. As of June 30, 2018, the maximum
amount of loan of our PRC subsidiary, Foshan Viomi and Beijing Viomi was
approximately RMB170,000 (US$25,691), RMB328.1 million (US$49.6 million) and
RMB34,000 (US$5,138), respectively. It would generally take us approximately
thirty days to obtain approvals or complete registration necessary to provide
funds to our PRC subsidiary, VIEs and their subsidiaries through capital
contributions or loans, subject to the specific timeline implemented by local
authorities. Furthermore, we expect the IPO proceeds to be used in China in the
form of RMB and, therefore, our PRC subsidiary, VIEs and their subsidiaries will
need to convert any capital contributions or loans from U.S. dollars to RMB. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations

development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from 
clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties

estimates of the costs to fund our clinical trials are based on the current
designs of the trials. If we were to modify the design of any of these clinical
trials, for instance, to increase the number of patients in the clinical trials,
our costs to fund the clinical trials could increase. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering.

Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash 
equivalents, together with the net proceeds from this offering, will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements through the fourth quarter of 2020. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect. We expect that the net proceeds from
this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to
enable us to complete each of our ongoing pivotal stage clinical trials for our
lead product candidates, naxitamab and omburtamab. However, we do not expect
that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash
equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to conduct through completion any
additional clinical trials of our lead product candidates for other indications
or to otherwise conduct and complete the development of our other product
candidates. Accordingly, we will need to raise substantial additional funds for
these purposes. We do not currently have any committed external sources of

repay our outstanding indebtedness under our term loan facilities (which
includes $30.0 million of indebtedness we incurred in September 2017 to finance
our acquisition of Ticketfly, LLC), which, had we completed this offering and
repaid the term loans on June 30, 2018, the amount of such repayment would equal
$83.1 million including prepayment penalties and (ii) for working capital and
other general corporate purposes. We may use some of the net proceeds to satisfy
tax withholding obligations related to the vesting and settlement of RSUs. We
may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary
businesses, products, services, technologies or other assets. We have not
entered into any agreements or commitments with respect to any material
acquisitions or investments at this time.

We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we
will receive from this offering or the amounts we actually spend on the uses set
forth above. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above,
we plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in
short-term and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
investments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of
the net proceeds from this offering and investors will be relying on the
judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds.

We entered into a loan and security agreement with Western Technology
Investments in June 2017, which provided for a secured credit facility of up to
$60.0 million of term debt. To finance our acquisition of Ticketfly, LLC, in
September 2017, we borrowed $30.0 million as a term loan under the facility."

The principal purposes of this offering are to (i) increase our capitalization
and financial flexibility and (ii) create a public market for our common stock.
We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering, to fund our
ongoing clinical activities and development of PRN1008, PRN2246 and PRN1371,
including investing in our planned and ongoing clinical trials as follows:

• PRN1008: approximately $50.0 million to complete the Phase 2 clinical trial
  and its extension in the treatment of pemphigus a portion of the cost of our
  Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of pemphigus and to continue clinical
  trials for the treatment of ITP;

technologies, products or assets. However, we have no current commitments or
obligations to do so.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the net
proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations
for at least 12 months following the date of this offering. After this offering,
we will require substantial capital in order to advance our current and any
other future drug candidates through pivotal clinical trials, regulatory
approval and commercialization. In addition, we will have broad discretion over
how to use the net proceeds to us from this offering. We intend to invest the

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. On each
    of November 3, 2017 and August 31, 2018, we borrowed $150,000 under the 
    promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses 
    of this offering. The $300,000 will be repaid upon completion of this 
    offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting 
    commissions) and amounts not to be held in the trust account. In the 
    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any 
    such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In 
    the event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this 
    table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $13,125,000, which constitutes the underwriter's
    deferred commissions (or $15,093,750 if the underwriter's over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs
    or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a ""no shop"" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $375,000,000 (or $431,250,000 if the underwriter's
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $13,125,000 (or
$15,093,750 if the underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $1,875,000 per year,
assuming an interest rate of 0.5% per year. Except with respect to interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to fund
our Regulatory Withdrawals and/or to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on assumed interest
rates, we expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income 
taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our 
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, utilities and 
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. On each of 
November 3, 2017 and August 31, 2018, we borrowed $150,000 under the promissory 
note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this 
offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the 
earlier of November 30, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be 
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering 
proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net 
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's ""penny stock"" rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in 
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of 
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to 
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of 
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with 
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with 
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

    prospectus. As of July 6, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding under such
    promissory note. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering
    out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held
    in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as
    set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing
    working capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more
    than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held
    in the trust account.
 
(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $21,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $24,150,000 if the underwriters’ option to
    purchase additional units is exercised in full) will be paid to the
    underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed
    estimates.
 
(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect the trust account
    to generate approximately $9,000,000 of interest annually; however, we can
    provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an
    interest rate of 1.5% per annum based upon current yields of securities in
    which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance
    transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
    combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and
    directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required.
    If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned
    amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the
    event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a
    portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
    loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay
    such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into
    warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The
    warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our
    sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no
    written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to
    seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
    or our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties
    will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all
    rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.
 
(7) Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding.
 
The rules of NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $600,000,000 (or $690,000,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $16,500,000 (or
$18,300,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering,
be placed in a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee. The funds in the trust account will be invested only
in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds that meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest only in direct U.S. government
obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $9,000,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 1.5% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of
the principal or interest held in the trust account, except with respect to
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to
us to pay our taxes, if any. The funds held in the trust account will not be
released from the trust account until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our
initial business combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance and timing of our
obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with
an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do
not complete our initial business combination within the completion window; and
(3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
initial business combination within the completion window, subject to applicable
law. Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the
trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply
the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of
post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their respective affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation or
other duty to loan funds to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $31,250 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 under an unsecured promissory note to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. As of August 15, 2018, $275,000 was outstanding under
such promissory note. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are
due at the earlier of March 31, 2019 and the closing of this offering. These
loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of
offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses
(other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as
may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In
the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a
portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay
such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into
warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our
sponsor. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from
parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and
directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan
such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to
funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their respective affiliates may also purchase shares in privately
negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the
completion of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any
such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions,
they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny
stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require
as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of
cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that
we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business
combination and then, only in connection with those public shares that such
stockholder has properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
in this prospectus; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide
for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business
combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within the completion window; and (3) the
redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within the completion window, subject to applicable law. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter
agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to (1) waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held
by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination
and (2) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and
public shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an
amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the
substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our
public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem
100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our initial business
combination within the completion window. In addition, our initial stockholders,
officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
completion window. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers or directors
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
completion window."

(or approximately $126.0 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common
stock offered by us in this offering, based on the initial public offering price
of $15.00 per share, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to fund the commercial launch of our
r-SNM System in the United States, if approved by the FDA. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $30.0 million to hire sales and clinical support personnel,
  including a specialty sales force of approximately 60 sales representatives,
  which we will initially endeavor to hire in anticipation of our potentially
  receiving FDA approval, to support the commercial launch of our r-SNM System
  in the United States, and to fund marketing initiatives in United States,
  Europe and Canada;

• approximately $25.0 million to conduct SNM-related research and development
  activities, consisting of expanding the suite of product solutions available
  for SNM therapy over time and to fund the technological enhancement of our
  r-SNM System, including, but not limited to, 1.5T/3.0T MRI full body
  conditional labelling for our r-SNM System, a reduction by half in the number
  of IPG battery recharging sessions required for the IPG to remain charged for
  one full month, and features that would enable us to connect our IPG to an
  already implanted InterStim II lead; and

• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot estimate with certainty the amount
of net proceeds to be used for the purposes described above. We may find it
necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will
have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses
described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-
and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments or other securities."

ADSs in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be
$209.8 million, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash, as follows: 

• approximately $65.8 million to fund the ongoing development of our product    
  candidates, including completing registrational trials and submitting for     
  regulatory approvals in the United States and Europe for OTL-101 for ADA-SCID,
  OTL-200 for MLD and OTL-103 for WAS, establishing clinical proof of concept

  our preclinical programs;                                                    

• approximately $17.8 million to fund the ongoing commercialization of          
  Strimvelis in the European Union and to expand our marketing and sales        
  infrastructure in key markets, including the United States and Europe, in     
  preparation for the potential commercial approval of OTL-101, OTL-200 and

  our own manufacturing facility, including the necessary laboratory and        
  manufacturing equipment, to support our long-term capacity needs for our      
  product pipeline; and                                                          

• the remainder to fund ongoing business development activities, general and    
  administrative expenses, working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. We may also use a portion of
the net proceeds to in-license, acquire, or invest in additional businesses,
technologies, products or assets. We cannot predict with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this
offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above.
Predicting the cost necessary to commercialize approved products and develop
product candidates can be difficult and the amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development, our plans to develop our in-house drug product and
vector manufacturing capabilities, the status of and results from clinical
trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our
product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to fund our operations and
capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2020. We have based
this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending our use of proceeds from this offering, we plan to invest these net
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation instruments, including short-term,
interest bearing obligations and investment-grade instruments."

As of June 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of
$92.5 million. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments as follows:

• Approximately $15 million to $20 million to improve and update our platform
  and core technologies by investing in equipment, expanding our research and
  development capabilities and establishing new (and scalable) operation
  facilities;

• Approximately $15 million to $18 million to expand our sales and marketing 
  capabilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia, including approximately $2 million
  to $3 million to establish our sales and marketing capabilities in China;

• Approximately $12 million to $14 million to continue to expand in the
  pharmaceutical biologics drug discovery and DNA data storage markets;

• Approximately $5 million to $10 million to establish our operations in China;
  and

• Any proceeds not applied to the foregoing will be used for working capital and
  general corporate purposes.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through strategic acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary
companies or technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any specific strategic acquisitions or in-licenses at this
time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

offering will be approximately $44.2 million, after deducting the estimated

underwriters exercise their option to purchase up to an 937,500 additional
ordinary shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us from this
offering will be approximately $51.2 million, after deducting the estimated
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, available for sale and short-term deposits, as
follows:

• approximately $20 million to $30 million to fund further clinical development
  of our product candidates, including the completion of our pivotal Phase 3
  clinical trial of our lead product candidate, NiCord, for the treatment of
  hematologic malignancies;

• approximately $5 million to $10 million to fund further development of our
  NAM-NK program; and

• the balance for other general corporate purposes, including general and
  administrative expenses and working capital.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to acquire or
invest in complementary products, technologies or businesses, although we have
no present agreements or commitments to do so.

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering as described above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of
funds is necessary. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical
development and regulatory approval process, it is difficult to estimate with
certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be
used for any of the above purposes on a stand-alone basis. Amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures will depend upon a number of factors, including our
sales, marketing and commercialization efforts, regulatory approval and demand
for our product candidates, operating costs and other factors. Accordingly, our 
management will have flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this 
offering. An investor will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, 
financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use the 
proceeds.

Based on our current plans, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale
financial assets and short-term deposits will be sufficient to enable us to
complete our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of NAM-NK, to complete our ongoing
Phase 1/2 clinical trial and our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of our lead
product candidate, NiCord, to seek FDA approval for NiCord for the treatment of
hematologic malignancies, and to establish our manufacturing capabilities. We
have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we
could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

invest such proceeds in in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing

use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for general corporate purposes,
which may include investment in product development, sales and marketing
activities, technology infrastructure, capital expenditures, and other general
and administrative matters. We plan to use up to approximately US$10 million to
repay shareholder loans from Xijin (Shanghai) Venture Capital Management Co.,
Ltd. We also plan to use up to approximately US$10 million to acquire a
micro-lending license, although we have no current agreement to acquire such a
license. We may also use a portion of these proceeds for the acquisition of, or
investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our
business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into
any acquisitions or investments. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will
vary depending on the amount of cash generated by our operations, and the rate
of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an
unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds
of this offering differently than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiary or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to
fund its capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely
basis, if at all.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities."

common stock that we are selling in this offering of approximately
$36.8 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us, based upon the initial public
offering price of $18.00 per share. We currently intend to use the net proceeds
from this offering to repay $36.8 million of outstanding borrowings under the
Credit Facility. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our
common stock by the selling stockholders.

On May 19, 2016, we entered into the Credit Facility, which bears interest
at a variable rate based on prime, federal funds, or LIBOR plus an applicable
margin based on our total leverage ratio. As of June 30, 2018, our interest
rates on term loan A and term loan B were 6.10% and 7.60%, respectively. As of
June 30, 2018, $0, $356.0 million and $77.9 million were outstanding under the
revolving credit facility, term loan A and term loan B, respectively. Following
the application of the net proceeds of this offering, we expect there to be
$344.9 million and $10.9 million outstanding under term loan A and term loan B,
respectively, excluding debt issuance costs, based on preliminary September 29,
2018 estimates, which reflects additional debt payments of $11.1 million and
$30.3 million on term loan A and term loan B, respectively, during the three
months ended September 29, 2018. The term loan A and the revolving credit
facility under the Credit Facility mature on May 19, 2021. The term loan B under
the Credit Facility matures on May 19, 2022."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
    from the funds we received from our initial shareholders described below.

(2) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting discounts and commissions
    equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our
    initial business combination, up to $3,500,000, which constitutes the 
    underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $4,025,000 if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination 
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. No discounts or 
    commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the private units.

(3) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not 
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Hong Ye has committed that it or its designees will purchase from us an
aggregate of 300,000 private units at a price of $10.00 per private unit (for an
aggregate purchase price of $3,000,000) in a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. It has also agreed that
if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in
part, it or its designees will purchase from us an additional number of private
units (up to a maximum of 30,000 private units, for a total of 330,000 private
units, or a total purchase price of $3,300,000, if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full) at a price of $10.00 per private unit necessary to maintain
in the trust account $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering. These
additional private units will be purchased in a private placement that will
occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of
the over-allotment option. The private units as described in more detail
elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the proceeds we receive from these
purchases will be placed in the trust account described below.

$100,000,000, or $115,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our
income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed
a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.

The payment to Hong Ye, of a monthly fee of $1,000 is for general and
administrative services, including office space and utilities. Hong Ye is solely
owned by Guan Wang. This arrangement is being agreed to by Hong Ye for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Ms. Wang with compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services, that the fee
charged by Hong Ye is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our
initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public shareholders. Other than the $1,000 per month fee, the $250,000 payment
to White and Williams LLP (an affiliate of our director) for its legal services
to the Company in connection with this offering and possible payments to such
firm for legal services (including with respect to periodic filings) prior to
the initial business combination and the repayment of $300,000 of non-interest
bearing loans from Guan Wang (none of which payments will be made from the
proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of
our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid to
our initial shareholders, officers, directors or any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to, or in order to effectuate the
consummation of, our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is).

White and Williams LLP will receive the sum of $250,000 for services provided
for this offering and other possible payments for services to be provided prior
to the initial business combination, structured in several installment payments
to reduce the cash flow burden of the Company. With the approval of White and
Williams, Howard Jiang, a partner of White and Williams, is serving as a member
of our board of directors. Mr. Jiang is solely serving in his personal capacity
and was selected due to his personal qualifications. Mr. Jiang will not provide
legal advice to the Company and will recuse himself from any matter or decision
relating to or concerning White and Williams, including but not limited to its
legal advice, and its engagement by the Company. This arrangement is solely for
our benefit and is not intended to provide our executive officers or directors
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on legal fees for similar
services, that the fee charged by White and Williams LLP is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.

Officers, directors and initial shareholders will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review
and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our initial shareholders,
officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested
director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit on the
amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the
extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an
initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the proceeds for legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations, due diligence of
prospective target businesses, legal and accounting fees related to SEC
reporting obligations, the monthly administrative fee described above, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described above.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to pay holders
who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held
in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto, upon consummation
of our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, Hong Ye has
agreed to pay the costs of liquidation to the extent the funds available to us
outside of the trust account are insufficient and have agreed not to seek
repayment of such amounts.

As of the date of this prospectus, Guan Wang has loaned us an aggregate of
$300,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee,
NASDAQ listing fees and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The
loan will be payable without interest on the consummation of our initial
business combination.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan
us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem
reasonable in their sole discretion. Each working capital loan would be
evidenced by a promissory note. The working capital notes would either be paid
upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at
holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into units
at a price of $10.00 per private unit. These units would be identical to the
private units. In the event that the initial business combination does not
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account
would be used for such repayment.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares in connection with our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period, (ii) if that public shareholder converts such shares, or sells such
shares to us in a tender offer, in connection with a business combination which
we consummate or (iii) we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and
restated Memorandum and Articles of Association that would affect our public
shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a
business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a
business combination within 12 months (or 15 or 18 months, as applicable) from
the closing of this offering. This redemption right shall apply in the event of
the approval of any such amendment to our amended and restated Memorandum and
Articles of Association, whether proposed by our initial shareholders, any
executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. In no
other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account."

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, or
approximately $72.4 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, based on the initial public offering price
of $10.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with 
our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $27.0 million for ongoing development of LB-001 in MMA, 
  including conducting our Phase 1/2 clinical trial through the initial data 
  read-out, clinical development outsourcing, drug manufacturing and internal
  personnel costs;

. approximately $29.0 million for discovery and preclinical development of 
  additional product candidates, including LB-101, LB-201 and LB-301, using our
  GeneRide platform; and

. the remainder for general corporate purposes.

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering as described, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of funds
is necessary. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including the progress of our preclinical development efforts,
our operating costs and other factors. As a result, our management will retain
broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash, together with the
net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned
operations for at least the next 18 months, enabling us to fund our operations
through the initial data read-out from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of LB-001 in
MMA. Following this offering, we will require substantial capital to complete
clinical development, seek regulatory approval of, and, if approved,
commercialize, LB-001. We may seek additional funds through public or private
equity, debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

approximately US$53.8 million, or approximately US$62.6 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately US$18.0 million for upgrade and expansion of manufacturing
  facilities;

• approximately US$18.0 million for research and development;

• approximately US$9.0 million for distribution network expansion; and

• the balance for general corporate purposes, including funding potential
  investments and acquisitions of complementary business, assets and
  technologies, although we currently do not have any specific plans and are
  not negotiating any such investments or acquisitions.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our VIE only
through loans, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and
approval requirements. The amount of capital contributions that we may make to
the WFOE is RMB120.0 million, without obtaining approvals from SAFE or other
government authorities. Additionally, the WFOE may increase its registered
capital to receive additional capital contributions from us and currently there
is no statutory limit to increasing its registered capital, subject to
satisfaction of applicable government registration and filing requirements.
Pursuant to relevant PRC regulations, we may provide loans to the WFOE up to the
larger amount of (i) the balance between the registered total investment amount
and registered capital of the WFOE, or (ii) twice the amount of the net assets
of the WFOE calculated in accordance with PRC GAAP, and we may provide loans to
the VIE up to twice the amount of the net assets of the VIE calculated in
accordance with PRC GAAP, each subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration or approval requirements. For any amount of loans that we may
extend to the WFOE or our VIE, such loans must be registered with the local
counterpart of SAFE. Medium- or long-term loans extended by our offshore 
entities to our VIE must also be approved by the NDRC. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a 
timely basis, or at all."

$353.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full, the net proceeds to us will be
approximately $406.6 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and enable access to
the public equity markets for us and our stockholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay the borrowings
outstanding under our second lien term loan. If there were to be excess
proceeds, we would use such proceeds for general corporate purposes, including
working capital, capital expenditures and continued investments in our growth
strategies. We may also use any such excess proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. However, we do not
have agreements or commitments for any acquisitions or investments at this time.

As of June 30, 2018, we had $315.0 million of debt outstanding under our second
lien term loan. The second lien term loan matures on February 5, 2025, and bears
interest at a variable rate, initially 9.03%. All of the outstanding borrowings
under our second lien term loan that were incurred within one year of the date
of this prospectus were incurred to refinance outstanding debt.

Our expected uses of our net proceeds from this offering are based upon our
present plans, objectives and business condition. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty the particular uses for our net
proceeds from this offering, and management has not estimated the amount of
proceeds, or the range of proceeds, to be used for any particular purpose. As
such, our management will have broad discretion in the application of our net
proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of
our management regarding the application of our net proceeds. Pending the use of
our proceeds from this offering as described above, we intend to invest our net
proceeds in short-term and long-term interest-bearing obligations, including
government and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds."

option to purchase additional ADSs in full and approximately US$2.5 million from
the concurrent private placement pursuant to the Assured Entitlement
Distribution, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and a
structuring fee and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for SC Class
A Shares in the form of ADSs for the benefit of all shareholders and obtain
additional capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the
Assured Entitlement Distribution to acquire newly-issued MSC Cotai Shares. In
turn, MSC Cotai intends to apply the net proceeds it receives from us for
repayment of certain of our existing indebtedness.

We currently do not have a definitive plan for the repayment of our existing
indebtedness. The weighted average interest rate of our existing indebtedness is
7.52% and its maturity ranges between November 30, 2019 and November 30, 2021.
The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our
business, and our plans and business conditions. The foregoing represents our
current intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions to use

significant flexibility in applying and discretion to apply the net proceeds of
the offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $40.2 million (or
$46.6 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares to cover over-allotments), after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of June 30, 2018, we had $8.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. In August
2018, we received $17.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of our Series D
redeemable convertible preferred stock and we received $2.0 million in
additional borrowings under our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley
Bank. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash, as follows:

• approximately $37.0 million to $39.0 million to advance PB2452;

• approximately $11.0 million to $13.0 million to advance PB1046;

• approximately $12.0 million to $14.0 million to fund development of our ELP 
  technology and preclinical programs; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering, together with our existing
cash, will enable us to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2020.
Based on our current operational plans and assumptions, we expect our cash and
cash equivalents, together with the net proceeds from this offering, will be
sufficient to complete our Phase 2a and Phase 2 clinical trials for PB2452,
initiate our Phase 3 clinical trial for PB2452, manufacture drug supply for
Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials and related commercial manufacturing
activities for PB2452, including scale-up, process characterization and
validation, complete our Phase 2b clinical trial for PB1046 and complete
IND-enabling studies for one additional preclinical product candidate. We have
based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use
our available capital resources sooner than we expect.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. Predicting the costs necessary to develop product candidates
can be difficult. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of those net proceeds. The timing and
amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash
flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business. Pending these
uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States."

• approximately $65.0 million for sales and marketing activities to support 
  ongoing commercialization of the iFuse Implant System, including, but not

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of  $225,000,000 (or $258,750,000 if
    the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full).

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsor of up to $150,000 as described in this prospectus. As of 
    June 30, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts (of up to $150,000 available
    to us) under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion 
    of the expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon 
    completion of this offering out of the $700,000 of offering proceeds that 
    has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than 
    underwriting commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than
    as set forth in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the 
    $1,500,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside
    for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering 
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be 
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.
 
(3) Excludes a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. equal
    to 3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (excluding any 
    applicable finders’ fees which might become payable) ($7,875,000 or up to 
    $9,056,250 if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full) upon 
    consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in 
    connection with our initial business combination. The fees will be paid to 
    EarlyBirdCapital and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. (or, at our discretion, other 
    FINRA members) from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining 
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, 
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or 
    for working capital. EarlyBirdCapital and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. (or such 
    other FINRA members) will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the 
    fee.
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement 
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and 
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current 
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.
 
The rules of NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $225,000,000 (or $258,750,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $7,875,000 (or up to
$9,056,250 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
payable to EarlyBirdCapital and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. (or, at our discretion,
other FINRA members) pursuant to the business combination marketing agreement,
will be placed in a trust account in the United States at J.P. Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee,
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $3,375,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 1.5% per year; however, we can provide no assurance regarding this
amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months
from the closing of this offering or to provide for redemption in connection 
with a business combination and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we 
are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from 
the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation
of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to reimburse an
affiliate of our sponsor up to $5,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
reimbursements.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$150,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
June 30, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts under the promissory note with
our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan
is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of December 31, 2018
or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the offering proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such working capital loans may be convertible into additional warrants at a
price of $0.50 (or $0.75 if we have not consummated our initial business
combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering) per warrant at
the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercisability and exercise price. The terms
of such working capital loans by our sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers
and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist
with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and the NYSE rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination. 

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require as a
closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the initial business combination, and instead may search for an alternate
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 18 months from the closing of this offering or to provide for redemption
in connection with a business combination and (iii) the redemption of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18
months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as
further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

placement will be approximately $260.3 million, or $297.0 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, based
upon the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

The principal purposes of this offering and the concurrent private placement are
to increase our financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the
marketplace, and create a public market for our common stock. We expect to use
the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement for
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including funding our
operating needs. However, we do not currently have specific planned uses for the
proceeds.

We may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary products, technologies, or businesses. However, we currently have
no agreements or commitments to complete any such transactions.

Since we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement for working capital and other general corporate purposes, our
management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement. As of the date of this
prospectus, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit, or
government securities."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    received from our sponsor described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) We are obligated to pay to EarlyBirdCapital a fee in an amount equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering for serving as an advisor in
    connection with our business combination. Accordingly, upon completion of
    our initial business combination, $1,750,000 (or up to $2,012,500 if the
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to
    EarlyBirdCapital from the funds held in the trust account.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at 
    approximately $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.
 
Our sponsor has committed to purchase the private units (for an aggregate
purchase price of $2,250,000) from us on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. It has also agreed that
if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in
part, it will purchase from us an additional number of private units (up to a
maximum of 18,750 additional private units) at a price of $10.00 per private
unit necessary to maintain in the trust account $10.00 per unit sold to the
public in this offering. These additional private units will be purchased in a
private placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units
resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private units are
identical to the units sold in this offering subject to certain limited
exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the proceeds we
receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.

$50,000,000, or $57,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our
income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed
a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.

The payment to our sponsor of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our benefit and
is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated officers and directors with
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the Mexico City metropolitan area, that the fee charged by
our sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our
initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public shareholders. Other than the $7,500 per month fee and the repayment of
the loan of up to $150,000 from our sponsor (none of which payments will be made
from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the
completion of our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind
will be paid to our sponsor, officers, directors or any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, such entity and individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Our
audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to
our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any
interested director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit
on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to
the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate
an initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our sponsor, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to
3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable
finders’ fees which might become payable) upon consummation of our initial
business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business
combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account
and interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we are permitted
to withdraw to pay such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us an aggregate of 
$133,575, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee,
the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated
to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they
deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a
promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial
business combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to
$1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into units at a price of  $10.00 per
unit. The units would be identical to the private units. In the event that the
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only (i) if we redeem 100% of the
outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the
required time period, (ii) if that public shareholder redeems such public

approximately $67.8 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares is exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered
by us in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

. approximately $50.0 million to fund research and development of EQ001; and

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,    
  including the additional costs associated with being a public company.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to in-license,
acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or 
assets. However, we have no current plans, commitments or obligations to do so.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our
currently planned operations for at least the next 24 months, although there can
be no assurance in that regard. In particular, we expect that the net proceeds
from this offering will allow us to fund a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of EQ001
for aGVHD, a Phase 2 clinical trial of EQ001 for cGVHD and a proof-of-concept
clinical trial of EQ001 for severe asthma.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including the progress, cost and results of our preclinical and
clinical development programs, our ability to obtain additional financing, and
other factors in this prospectus, as well as the amount of cash used in our
operations and any unforeseen cash needs. We may find it necessary or advisable
to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and our management will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying
on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately $25.0 million to fund our portion of the costs for the ongoing
  UCART19 CALM and PALL clinical trials;

• approximately $40.0 million to fund our portion of the costs for the planned
  UCART19 CALM II and PALL II clinical trials;

• approximately $40.0 million to fund our portion of the costs for the planned
  clinical trial of ALLO-501;

• approximately $60.0 million to fund the planned clinical trial of ALLO-715;

• approximately $45.0 million to fund the transition services from Pfizer and
  the expansion of our facilities, including the build-out of our headquarters

• approximately $35.0 million to fund our internal research and development
  capabilities to advance new product candidates; and

acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our
operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the
next 36 months from the date of this offering and through the completion of the
CALM and PALL clinical trials, the Phase 1 clinical trial of ALLO-501 and the
Phase 1 clinical trial of ALLO-715. We may require additional funding to be able
to complete the CALM II and PALL II clinical trials, and any Phase 2 portion of
the ALLO-501 and ALLO-715 clinical trials. It is difficult to predict the cost
and timing required to complete our clinical trials due to, among other factors,
our lack of experience with initiating and conducting clinical trials, the rate
of subject enrollment in our clinical trials, filing requirements with various
regulatory agencies, clinical trial results, and the actual costs of
manufacturing and supplying our product candidates.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the progress,
cost and results of our preclinical and clinical development programs, and
whether we are able to enter into future licensing or collaboration
arrangements. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for
other purposes, and our management will have broad discretion in the application
of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds from this offering.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the 
    payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the 
    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such
    amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.25% of 
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the 
    completion of our initial business combination, $4,062,500, which 
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $4,671,875 if the 
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to 
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or 
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest 
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only 
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government 
    treasury obligations. Assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year, we 
    estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately 
    $1,875,000 per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this 
    amount.

(5) Assumes no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.

The rules of Nasdaq provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the
$130,437,500 in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the
private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $149,703,125 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $125,000,000 ($10.00
per unit), or $143,750,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $5,437,500, or
up to $5,953,125 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in
full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this
offering and for working capital following this offering. We will not be
permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust
account, except for the withdrawal of interest income (if any) to pay our income
taxes, if any, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public
shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an
amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of
our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering. Based on current interest
rates, we expect that interest income earned on the trust account (if any) will
be sufficient to pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, together with funds available to us
from loans from our sponsor, will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to
which such proceeds are allocated. However, if our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or any of their affiliates, but such
persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and
administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount
not to exceed $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and
are due at the earlier of December 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The
loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of
offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set forth above,
the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our
initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.
 
(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the
    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such
    amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. If offering
    expenses are greater than set forth in this table, such excess will reduce
    amounts available post-closing for working capital expenses.
 
(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the
    completion of our initial business combination, up to $14,000,000, which
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $16,100,000 if
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid
    to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.
 
NYSE rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering
and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust account.
Of the $410.0 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $471.2 million
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $400 million
($10.00 per unit), or $460.0 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and
$10.0 million, or up to $11.2 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the
closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The
proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government
treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$4,000,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.0% per year; however, we can
provide no assurances regarding this amount. We will not be permitted to
withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account, except for
the withdrawal of interest to pay our income taxes, if any, until the earliest
of  (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption
of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted
in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in
connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within
24 months from the closing of this offering. Based on current interest rates, we
expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay
income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us. However, our amended and restated memorandum and
articles of association provides that, following this offering and prior to the
consummation of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from
issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to
(i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public
shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to
our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the
time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months from the
closing of this offering.

We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and
administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount
not to exceed $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31,
2018 or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set forth above,
the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our
initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

Our sponsor and our independent director nominees have agreed to make an
aggregate investment of $35,000,000 in us at the time of our initial business
combination. We have entered into forward purchase agreements with our sponsor
and our independent director nominees which provide for the purchase of an
aggregate of 3,500,000 Class A ordinary shares, plus an aggregate of 1,166,666
redeemable warrants to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share,
for an aggregate purchase price of  $35,000,000, or $10.00 per Class A ordinary
share, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of our
initial business combination. The forward purchase warrants will have the same
terms as our public warrants. These purchases will be made regardless of whether
any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders. The forward
purchase securities will be issued only in connection with the closing of the
initial business combination. The proceeds from the sale of forward purchase
securities may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in our
initial business combination, expenses in connection with our initial business
combination or for working capital in the post-transaction company."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    September 4, 2018, we had borrowed approximately $198,100 (of up to $300,000
    available to us) under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a
    portion of the expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon
    completion of this offering out of the $650,000 of offering proceeds that
    has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than
    underwriting commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than
    as set forth in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the
    $1,350,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside
    for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $7,000,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s
    deferred commissions (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the placement units,
$200,000,000 (or $230,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including $7,000,000 (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting
commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $2,000,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 1.0% per year; however, we can provide no assurance regarding
this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the placement units
will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a)
the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any
public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the
closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
September 4, 2018, we had borrowed approximately $198,100 under the promissory
note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of
December 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon
the closing of this offering out of the $1,350,000 of offering proceeds not held
in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the
option of the lender. The units would be identical to the placement units. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds
and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our
trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and NASDAQ rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination. 

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and (along with Cantor and/or its designees) their
placement shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial
stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to
complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

this offering at the assumed initial public offering price of $36.00 per share,
and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $229.5 million, or
approximately $264.6 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, to create a public market for our shares and thereby
enable access to the public equity markets for our employees and shareholders
and to increase our visibility in the marketplace. We currently intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes,
including working capital, research and development, sales and marketing
activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures,
although we do not currently have any specific plans with respect to the use of
proceeds for such purposes. In addition, we may also use a portion of the net
proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions,
products, or businesses that complement our business, although we have no
present commitments or agreements to enter into any material acquisitions or
investments. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds of
this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing instruments."

    released to the underwriters only upon consummation of an initial business
    combination, as described in this prospectus. If the business combination is
    not consummated, such deferred discount will be forfeited by the
    underwriters. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued
    on the deferred underwriting discount.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at
    approximately $650,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our sponsors, the Azimut Investors and the underwriters in this offering have
committed that they or their designees will purchase the private warrants (for
an aggregate purchase price of $3,450,000) from us on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. They have also agreed
that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in
part, they or their designees will purchase from us an additional number of
private warrants (up to a maximum of 330,000 private warrants, for a total of
3,780,000 private warrants, or a total purchase price of $3,780,000, if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full) necessary to maintain in the trust
account $10.15 per unit sold to the public in this offering. These additional
private warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur
simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the
over-allotment option. The private warrants are identical to the warrants sold
in this offering subject to certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in
this prospectus. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be
placed in the trust account described below.

$55,825,000, or $64,198,750 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our
income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed
a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.

The payment to IBIS Capital Limited, an affiliate of certain of our officers and
directors, of a monthly fee in an aggregate amount of $10,000 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by IBIS Capital Limited for our
benefit and is not intended to provide our officers or directors with
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services, that the fee charged by IBIS Capital Limited is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination
or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than
the $10,000 per month fee and the repayment of $125,000 of non-interest bearing
loans from our initial stockholders (none of which payments will be made from
the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion
of our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid
to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, they will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review
and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our initial stockholders,
officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested
director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit on the
amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the
extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an
initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$650,000. We intend to use the proceeds for legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations, due diligence of
prospective target businesses, legal and accounting fees related to SEC
reporting obligations, the monthly administrative fee described above, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
stockholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described above.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including the deferred underwriting fee payable to
the underwriters of up to 3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering
upon consummation of our initial business combination. To the extent that our
capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to
consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and
will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital
to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target
business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from the up to $100,000 of interest (which shall be net
of taxes payable) that may be earned on the funds held in the trust account that
will be available to us for such purposes.

As of the date of this prospectus, our initial stockholders have agreed to loan
us an aggregate of $125,000 to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee
and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable
without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering
expenses. As of July 2, 2018, we have borrowed $297 from the initial
stockholders.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 21 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan
us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem
reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a
promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial
business combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to
$1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per
warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private warrants. In the event
that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of
the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts,
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares in connection with our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period, (ii) if that public stockholder converts such shares, or sells such
shares to us in a tender offer, in connection with a business combination which
we consummate or (iii) we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’
ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business
combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business
combination within the time period described in this prospectus. This redemption
right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment to our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, whether proposed by our
initial stockholders, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or
any other person. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our potential future access to the public equity markets. As of the
date of this prospectus, we have no specific plan for the net proceeds from this
offering, or any significant portion thereof. However, we intend to use the net

in products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our business.
However, we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such
transaction.

million, or approximately $92.7 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering together with our
existing cash and cash equivalents as follows:

• approximately $40 million to advance KSI-301 through completion of enrollment
  of the global Phase 2 clinical trial in the U.S., EU and rest of the world in
  patients with wet AMD as well as through completion of a Phase 1b clinical
  trial;

• approximately $25 million to advance KSI-301 into Phase 2 clinical trials in
  China for wet AMD and DME/DR and through an administrative interim analysis in
  each of the studies (anticipated to occur when approximately 200 patients have
  completed approximately six months of treatment duration, per study);

• approximately $15 million to advance KSI-301 into the global Phase 2 clinical
  trial in the U.S., EU and rest of the world in patients with DME/DR; and

• the remainder for research and development of our pipeline including KSI-501,
  to initiate additional clinical studies in ophthalmology and for working
  capital and other general corporate purposes.

Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash
equivalents, and the anticipated net proceeds from this offering will provide
sufficient funds to sustain our operations through at least the next 12 months.
Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and
the anticipated net proceeds from this offering to be available to fund our
operations is based on assumptions that may prove inaccurate, and we could use
our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may elect to
delay the initiation of the global Phase 2 clinical trial in the U.S., EU and
rest of world in patients with DME/DR, as well as other development efforts, to
enable sufficient funding for completion of the global Phase 2 clinical trial in
the U.S., EU and rest of world in patients with wet AMD. If we continue our plan
to complete each of the clinical trials of KSI-301 set forth above, then we will
need to raise additional funds to complete the trials, including the global
Phase 2 clinical trial in the U.S., EU and rest of the world in patients with
wet AMD. We will also require additional funds to advance our pipeline research
and development efforts, including KSI-501, and to initiate additional clinical
studies in ophthalmology, the amounts of which will depend on the ultimate
clinical development paths we pursue. We may satisfy our future cash needs
through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other
third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other
collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination
of these approaches.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical studies or
clinical studies we may commence in the future, as well as any collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties, or any business development
opportunities we may engage in for our programs and any unforeseen cash needs.

We may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary products, technologies, or businesses; however, we currently have
no agreements or commitments to complete any such transactions.

Since we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital
and other general corporate purposes, our management will have broad discretion
over the use of the net proceeds from this offering. As of the date of this
prospectus, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term
interest-bearing investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit or

common stock that we are selling in this offering at the initial public offering
price of $15.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately
$89.1 million, or $103.4 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by
the selling stockholders, although we will bear the costs, other than
underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with the sale of these
shares.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, increase our visibility in the marketplace, obtain additional
capital, and increase our capitalization and financial flexibility. We currently
intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering primarily for
working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include product
development, general and administrative matters, and capital expenditures. We
also intend to use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this offering
to repay approximately $10.0 million of indebtedness under our Loan Agreement.
We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or
investment in, technologies, solutions, or businesses that complement our
business. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any acquisitions
or investments outside the ordinary course of business at this time.

The approximately $10.0 million of outstanding indebtedness that we intend to
repay under our Loan Agreement represents $10.0 million of outstanding
indebtedness under a revolving line of credit. The $10.0 million under the
revolving line of credit is scheduled to mature in September 2020, and interest
on such borrowings accrues at a fixed per annum rate equal to the prime rate.

to us from this offering will be approximately $20.0 million, after deducting

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility and create a public market in the United States for our securities.
Each product candidate within the BioSeizer platform and the NanoX platform
shares technology and equipment, as well as manufacturing expenses, with the
other product candidates in the same platform. As a result, we currently expect
to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $13 million to fund product candidates in our BioSeizer
  technology platform, including (1) advancing TLC590 through a Phase I/II
  clinical trial in patients with inguinal hernia and beginning a Phase II
  clinical trial in patients with bunionectomy for TLC590, (2) beginning two
  pivotal trials in patients with OA pain for TLC599 and (3) continuing a Phase
  II clinical trial for TLC399;

• approximately $2 million to fund product candidates in our NanoX technology
  platform, including continuing an adult Phase I/II clinical trial of TLC178;
  and

• the remaining proceeds, if any, to fund working capital and other general
  corporate purposes, which may include the hiring of additional personnel,
  capital expenditures and the costs of operating as a public company.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and prevailing business conditions,
which could change in the future as our plans and prevailing business conditions
evolve. Predicting the cost necessary to develop product candidates can be
difficult and the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, any collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next
12 months. In particular, we estimate that such funds, together with such cash
on hand, will be sufficient to enable us to begin late stage or pivotal trial
enrollment for each of our four lead product candidates, TLC599, TLC399, TLC590
and TLC178. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be
wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently
expect. Regardless, we will require additional capital beyond this offering in
order to complete pivotal clinical trials of, file for regulatory approval for,
or commercialize any of our product candidates. While we anticipate seeking
additional capital in the future through further equity offerings and/or debt
borrowings, or through collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing
arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we cannot guarantee
that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all.

Until we receive future funding, we intend to delay our plans to conduct a
Phase I/II clinical trial for TLC178 in pediatric RMS. We may not procure such
funding in the future or our business plans may change, in which case we may
decide to not conduct this trial.

Pending these uses, we plan to place the net proceeds in time deposit accounts."

million, or approximately $3.21 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, at an IPO price of $9.90 per ADS, which reflects
a discount of 3.04% to the last reported sale price of £0.795 per ordinary share
on AIM on November 19, 2018 equivalent to US$10.21 per ADS based on an exchange
rate of £1.00 to $1.2839, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund our planned clinical
trials, manufacturing and process development, analytical testing, regulatory
expenses and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, as
follows:

. approximately $1.09 million to partially fund advancing the clinical
  development of Milciclib, which we expect will be sufficient to complete our
  ongoing Phase 2a study with Milciclib as a single therapy, or monotherapy, in
  HCC patients, and to commence a Phase 2b clinical trial for the combination of
  Milciclib with Sorafenib in naïve HCC patients (the costs associated with
  protocol development in respect of this Phase 2b study have already been paid,
  accordingly the major direct costs  of initiating this trial are limited the
  purchasing sufficient quantities of Nexavar® from Bayer and the costs of
  activation of clinical sites);

. approximately $1.52 million to partially fund advancing the clinical
  development of Foralumab, which we expect will be sufficient to complete Phase
  1 trials evaluating both oral and nasal administration of Foralumab in healthy
  volunteers (which trials will be largely funded through the collaboration with
  the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston,
  Massachusetts, save for formulation costs), and to commence Phase 2 trials for
  treatment of NASH with Foralumab and nasal administration of Foralumab for
  treatment of progressive MS patients, respectively; and

. the remainder, if any, to fund working capital and other general corporate
  purposes.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire, or invest in additional
products or assets, businesses, or technologies, although currently we have no
specific agreements, commitments, or understandings in this regard. As of the
date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or
the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Predicting
the costs necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our

clinical trials we may commence in the future, as well as any collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties and any unforeseen cash needs. As a
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from this offering.

We anticipate that our existing cash resources, together with the net proceeds
from the offering, the proceeds of the warrant exercise ($1,399,631) and the
subscription proceeds ($1,500,000), will enable us to fully fund our operating
expenses for the planned trials outlined above and our planned capital
expenditure requirements to the end of 2019. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available
capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from the offering
in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations and certificates of
deposit. The goal with respect to the investment of these net proceeds is
capital preservation and liquidity so that such funds are readily available to
fund our operations."

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for the ADSs for the benefit of all

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $200,000,000 (or $230,000,000  
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full).             

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans   
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of    
    September 30, 2018, we had borrowed $142,600 (of up to $300,000 available to 
    us) under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of   
    the expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon completion  
    of this offering out of the offering proceeds that has been allocated for
    the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions). In 
    the event that offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table,
    they will be repaid using a portion of the $850,000 of offering proceeds not 
    held in the trust account and set aside for post-closing working capital
    expenses. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in 
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital 
    expenses.     

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial       
    business combination, $7,000,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s        
    deferred commissions (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment      
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds 
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to 
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be 
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or        
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general 
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on            
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The            
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred    
    underwriting discounts and commissions.                                      

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be   
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or  
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For       
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement 
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a 
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for 
    our expenses.      

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment    
    fees for financing. 

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $200,000,000 (or $230,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $7,000,000 (or $8,050,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $3,000,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 1.5% per year; however, we can provide no assurance
regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, the
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will
not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the
completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public
shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of
this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to
stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account, as well as the up to $50,000,000 contingent private placement
described elsewhere in this prospectus, for general corporate purposes,
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction
company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in
completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other
companies or for working capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise
funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business
combination, including pursuant to contingent forward purchase agreements we may
enter into following consummation of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
September 30, 2018, we had borrowed $142,600 under the promissory note with our
sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31,
2018 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of offering proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

The contingent forward purchaser has agreed to enter into a contingent forward
purchase contract with us, to purchase up to 5,000,000 units for $10.00 each, in
a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of our initial
business combination, for an aggregate purchase price of up to $50,000,000. The
contingent forward purchase units and their component securities would be
identical to the units being sold in this offering, except that the contingent
forward purchase units and their component securities would be subject to
transfer restrictions and certain registration rights, as described herein. The
funds from the sale of contingent forward purchase units may be used as part of
the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of 
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it 
difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our
securities on a national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with the completion of our initial business 
    combination.

(2) Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor may loan us up to 
    $750,000 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering. These
    loans, if any, will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the 
    $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of
    offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that 
    offering expenses are less than as set forth in this table, any such amounts
    will be available for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $7,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’ option to purchase
    additional units is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from
    the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released
    to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring an initial business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amounts
    in the table above do not include interest available to us from the trust
    account, which is limited to amounts to pay our taxes; however, we can
    provide no assurances regarding this amount. Based upon current interest
    rates, we would expect the trust account to generate approximately $3.9
    million of interest annually following the investment of such funds in
    specified U.S. Government Treasury bills or in specified money market funds
    This estimate assumes an interest rate of 1.96% per annum based upon current
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In
    addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
    intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our
    sponsor or certain of our officers or directors may, but are not obligated
    to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
    combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the
    trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only
    out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial
    business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
    capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
    proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts.
    Up to $250,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the
    post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the
    option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
    placement warrants issued to our sponsor, including as to exercise price,
    exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such loans by our sponsor,
    an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers or directors, if any,
    have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to
    such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our
    sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers or
    directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to
    loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek
    access to funds in our trust account.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing. This amount does not include any investment banking fees
    which may be payable upon consummation of an initial business combination.
    Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. has not yet been retained for a specific
    financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising or other transaction and
    so we are not able to quantify the fees for any such engagement. No funds
    will be paid out of the trust to fund any such fee payments and it is not
    expected that any fees would be paid prior to the consummation of a business
    combination. The actual amount of fees received will vary significantly
    based on the size of any transaction and the extent to which other
    investment banks are involved.

(6) In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
    business combination, our sponsor has committed an aggregate of $1,000,000,
    to be provided to us to fund our expenses relating to investigating and 
    selecting a target business and other working capital requirements after
    this offering and prior to our initial business combination.

The rules of Nasdaq provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement securities be deposited in a
trust account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement securities, $200,000,000 (or $230,000,000 if the underwriters’ option
to purchase additional shares is exercised in full), including $7,000,000 or
$8,050,000 of deferred underwriting commissions if the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional shares is exercised, will be deposited in a segregated trust
account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act
which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Based on
current interest rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust
account will be approximately $3.9 million per year, assuming an interest rate
of 1.96% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in
the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, we will
not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust
account and these funds will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing date of this offering,
subject to applicable law, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares
properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing date of this offering. Based on current interest rates, we expect that
interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay our taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our business combination, including pursuant to
forward purchase agreements we may enter into following the consummation of this
offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. However, if our estimate of
the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
our sponsor, members of our management team or any of their affiliates, but such
persons are not under any obligation to loan funds to, or invest in, us.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor may loan us up to an
aggregate of $750,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
These loans, if any, will be non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the
earlier of May 30, 2019 or the closing of this offering. These loans, if any,
will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of
offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, (i) our sponsor has committed an
aggregate of $1,000,000, to be provided to us in the event that funds held
outside of the trust are insufficient to fund our expenses relating to
investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital
requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business combination
and (ii) our sponsor, one or more affiliates of our sponsor, or certain of our
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be
required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such
loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust
account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we
may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay
such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to
repay such loaned amounts. Up to $250,000 of such loans may be convertible into
warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant
at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants issued to our sponsor, including as to exercise price,
exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, an
affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers or directors, if any, have
not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate
of our sponsor or certain of our officers or directors, if any, as we do not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

We have granted Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., an affiliate of our sponsor (and
an underwriter of this offering), a right of first refusal for a period of 36
months from the date of the commencement of sales of the public offering to act
as one of potentially several banks which provide to us certain financial
advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which it may
receive a portion of the overall fees.

MIHI Boxwood Sponsor, LLC, which owns 50% of our sponsor (and thus beneficially
owns more than 10% of our outstanding common stock), is an affiliate of
Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., which we expect will be an underwriter in this
offering. As a result, is deemed to have a “conflict of interest” within the
meaning of FINRA Rule 5121. Accordingly, this offering is being made in
compliance with the applicable requirements of Rule 5121. Rule 5121 requires
that a “qualified independent underwriter,” as defined in Rule 5121, participate
in the preparation of the registration statement and prospectus and exercise the
usual standards of due diligence with respect thereto. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
has agreed to act as a “qualified independent underwriter” for this offering. We
have agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC against certain liabilities
incurred in connection with acting as a “qualified independent underwriter,”
including liabilities under the Securities Act. In addition, no underwriter with
a conflict of interest will confirm sales to any account over which it exercises
discretionary authority without the specific prior written approval of the
account holder.

Our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or
their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately
negotiated transactions or on the open market either prior to or following the
completion of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any
such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial
business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or
intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or
conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust
account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section
13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject
to such reporting requirements.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business
combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth
or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their
redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement
or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption
of our public shares or the business combination, and instead would search for
an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing date
of this offering, subject to applicable law; and (iii) the redemption of our
public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to
approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of
our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing date of this offering. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares they may acquire
during or after this offering in connection with the completion of our initial
business combination. Our other directors and officers have entered into letter
agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial stockholders with
respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. In
addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder
shares and private placement shares if we fail to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing date of this offering. However, if
our initial stockholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month
time frame."

(1) As of the date of this prospectus, $229,625 of these expenses have been
    paid from the proceeds of loans made to us by FinTech Investor Holdings III,
    LLC. Loans by FinTech Investor Holdings III, LLC will be repaid upon the 
    earlier of the completion of this offering or December 31, 2018. If offering 
    expenses actually paid are less than the estimates set forth in this table, 
    the balance will be used for post-closing working capital.

(2) The representative has agreed to defer until consummation of our initial
    business combination $12.0 million of their underwriting commissions (or
    approximately $14.7 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is
    exercised in full), which equals 4.0% of the gross proceeds from the units 
    sold to the public, excluding any units purchased pursuant to the 
    underwriters’ overallotment option, and 6.0% of the gross proceeds from the
    units sold to the public pursuant to the underwriters’ overallotment option.
    Upon consummation of our initial business combination, the deferred 
    commissions will be paid to the representative from the funds held in the 
    trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be 
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, 
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital.

(3) $300.0 million from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement
    (approximately $345.0 million if the underwriters exercise their
    overallotment option in full), including deferred underwriting commissions 
    of $12.0 million (approximately $14.7 million if the underwriters exercise 
    their overallotment option in full), will be placed in a trust account held
    at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., located in the United States, with Continental
    Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    If we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to 
    industry specific regulation, we may incur additional expenses associated 
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary, and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.

A total of $300.0 million (or approximately $345.0 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the aggregate net proceeds from
this offering and the private placement, including $12.0 million (or
approximately $14.7 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option in full) of the deferred underwriting discount, will be placed in a trust
account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and
will be invested only in United States government treasury bills with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in United States
Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act. Except for interest income released to us for the payment of taxes
or dissolution expenses, none of the funds held in the trust account will be
released, subject to the requirements of law, until the earlier of (i) the
consummation of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of our
public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 24
months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ overallotment option), subject to applicable law; (iii) the
redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our liquidation or
if our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases to
pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of the
24 month period (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust
account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment,
that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify an attractive
business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal
requirements to consummate a business combination). Based on current interest
rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $4,500,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year.

The net proceeds held in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting
commissions) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. If we pay for
our initial business combination using stock or debt securities, or if we do not
use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase
price in connection with our business combination, we may use the remaining cash
released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for
maintenance or expansion of the operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement
held out of trust will be sufficient to pay our costs and expenses prior to our
initial business combination. This belief is based on the fact that while we may
begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an
indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending
on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that
addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management 
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to 
advance funds to, or invest in, us. In addition, if we increase or decrease the
size of this offering, it would result in a proportionate increase or decrease 
in the amount of interest earned in the trust account and available to us. While
we currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and 
while they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, we
believe that any additional interest income earned would facilitate our ability
to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater number of potential
acquisition targets.

FinTech Investor Holdings III, LLC has committed to loan us up to an aggregate
of $500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering ($229,625
of which has been loaned as of the date of this prospectus). These loans are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of December 31, 2018 or
the completion of this offering. In addition, in order to fund transaction costs
in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor,
members of our management team or any of their respective affiliates or other
third parties may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required.
If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned
amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such
loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the
event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion
of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned
amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such
loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants
at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor as part of
the private placement units. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, members of our
management team or any of their respective affiliates as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

We will reimburse our sponsor or its affiliate for office space, utilities,
secretarial support and administrative services provided to members of our
management team, in an amount equal to $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our
initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their respective
affiliates may purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial
business combination, although as of the date of this prospectus (apart from the
purchase of the placement units) they have no commitments, plans or intentions
to engage in such transactions. If they do effect such purchases, we anticipate
that they would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities
that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption of their
shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in direct
negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions. All holders approached
in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There is no
limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our sponsor, directors,
officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when
they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to
the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange
Act or in transactions that would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under
the Exchange Act. Although they do not currently anticipate paying any premium
purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the price they may
pay. They may also enter into transactions to provide such holders with
incentives to acquire shares or vote their shares in favor of an initial
business combination. No funds in the trust account may be used to effect
purchases of shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination. Moreover, the redemption threshold may be further limited
by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If the amount
of redemptions plus any cash required by our initial business combination would
cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,000, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 24 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option), 
subject to applicable law; (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly 
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any
exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our
liquidation or in the event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the 
trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination 
prior to the expiration of the 24 month period (our board of directors may 
determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it 
determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining
time that we will be able to identify an attractive acquisition target or 
satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a 
business combination). In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

The initial holders, our officers and directors and Cantor Fitzgerald have
agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and
placement shares, as applicable, (i) in connection with the consummation of a
business combination, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the completion
of this offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment
option) and (iii) if we fail to consummate a business combination within 24
months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ overallotment option) or if we liquidate prior to the expiration
of the 24 month period. The initial holders and our directors and officers have
also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to public shares in
connection with the consummation of a business combination and in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100%
of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within the 24 month period. However, the initial holders and our directors and
officers will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any public shares
held by them if we fail to consummate a business combination or liquidate within
the 24 month period. Cantor Fitzgerald will have the same redemption rights as a
public stockholder with respect to any public shares it acquires."

approximately US$35.1 million, or approximately US$41.4 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees and obtain
additional capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily
for general corporate purposes, which may include investment in product
development, sales and marketing activities, technology infrastructure, capital
expenditures, improvement of corporate facilities and other general and
administrative matters. We may also use a portion of these proceeds for the
investment in, or acquisition of, technologies, solutions or businesses that
complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements
to enter into any investments or acquisitions.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary in China only through loans or capital contributions
and to our variable interest entity only through loans, subject to the approval
of government authorities and limit on the amount of capital contributions and
loans. Subject to satisfaction of the applicable government registration and
approval requirements, we intend to extend loans of up to the Renminbi
equivalent of US$25 million to Fuzhou Online Microcredit, a wholly owned
subsidiary of our variable interest entity, to increase its registered capital.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: 

• approximately $37.0 million to hire additional sales and marketing personnel
  and expand marketing programs both in the United States and internationally; 

• approximately $11.0 million to fund product development and research and 
  development activities; and                                              

• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to acquire,
in-license or invest in products, technologies or businesses that are
complementary to our business. However, we currently have no agreements or
commitments to complete any such transaction.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above.

We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other
purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $19.1 million (or
$22.1 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares), based on an initial public offering price of $6.00 per
share, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of June 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.9 million. We intend
to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and
cash equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $13.7 million to fund clinical trials, product licensing
  opportunities and product development;                               

. approximately $5.2 million to fund FDA filing fees;

. approximately $2.0 million to fund laboratory expansion; and

The following table sets forth our estimates, as of the date of this prospectus,
of the amount to be allocated to each of our current product candidates, other
than CT-100, from our cash on hand and the net proceeds of this offering. As of
the date of this prospectus, we believe the dollar amounts set forth below will
be adequate to fund product development through FDA approval, including
development activities, licensing payments, milestone payments, clinical trial
or bioequivalence costs, and NDA filing fees, for each of our product
candidates, other than CT-100:

We are currently working with a clinical research organization to analyze the 
cost and protocol for CT-100’s clinical program. The product may be cost 
prohibitive for us, in which case we may seek to partner or license the product
to a larger and more well-capitalized company. For this reason, as of the date 
of this prospectus, we are unable to estimate the amount required to fund CT-100
through regulatory approval and we do not intend to allocate a meaningful amount
of our cash on hand or net proceeds of this offering towards CT-100. To the 
extent we require additional funds to develop CT-100 or complete the development
of our other product candidates through regulatory approval, we will endeavor to
do so through cash flow from operations, of which there can be no assurance. In 
the event we are unable to fund further development internally, we will endeavor
to seek additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale 
of our equity and debt securities, licensing fees for our technology and joint
ventures with industry partners. However, there can be no guarantees that such
funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such
financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further
pursue our product candidates.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above.
We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through the acquisition or in- license of complementary product
candidates. While we have no current agreements for any specific acquisitions or
in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these
purposes.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and other development and
commercialization efforts for our initial product candidates, as well as the
amount of cash used in our operations. Based on our current operational plans
and assumptions, we expect our cash and cash equivalents, together with the net
proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations
over, at least, the 24 months following the close of this offering.

However, we cannot estimate with certainty the amount of net proceeds to be used
for the purposes described above. We may find it necessary or advisable to use
the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we plan to
invest the net proceeds from this offering in short- and intermediate-term,
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the government."

approximately $12,044,500, or approximately $13,886,800 if the underwriter
exercises in full its option to purchase additional shares, based on an public
offering price of $5.00 per Class A Unit, after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. This estimate excludes the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of common
warrants in this offering. If all of the Series A common warrants sold in this
offering were to be exercised in cash at an exercise price of $5.50 per share,
we would receive additional net proceeds of approximately $15 million. We cannot
predict when or if these Series A common warrants will be exercised. It is
possible that these Series A common warrants may expire and may never be
exercised.

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plan and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering. The
amounts and timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on
numerous factors. As a result, management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. We currently
estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: (i)

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds from this Offering. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our research,
development and commercialization efforts, the progress of our preclinical
trials, and our operating costs and capital expenditures. Drug discovery and
development in the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by significant risks
and uncertainties inherent in the research, clinical development and regulatory
approval process. These uncertainties make it difficult for us to estimate the
costs to conduct our research and development and complete our preclinical
trials. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the
net proceeds of this Offering, and we reserve the right to change the allocation
of use of these proceeds as a result of contingencies such as the progress and
results of our preclinical trials and our research and development activities,
the results of our commercialization efforts, competitive developments and our
manufacturing requirements. In addition, when and if the opportunity arises, we
may use a portion of the proceeds to license, acquire or invest in complementary
businesses, products, or technologies. In order to license, acquire or invest in
complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may need to curtail our
development of our Other Projects under Development described above, or enter
into agreements allowing others to obtain rights for further development of one
or more of our drug and device candidates earlier than anticipated. We currently
have no commitments or agreements to acquire any such businesses, products or
technologies, and we cannot determine with certainty which, if any, of the
programs above might be affected should we enter into any such commitments.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the Class A Ordinary
Shares being offered by the Selling Shareholders, although we may receive
additional proceeds of up to approximately $913,000 if all of the Series A Note
PA Warrants and the Bond PA Warrants are exercised for cash, of which there can
be no guarantee. We will not receive any additional proceeds to the extent that
the Series A Note PA Warrants and the Bond PA Warrants are exercised by cashless
exercise. We expect to use the proceeds received from the exercise of those
warrants, if any, for general working capital purposes. We cannot assure you,
however, that any of those warrants will ever be exercised.

The net proceeds from this Offering, together with our cash and marketable
securities, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our product candidates
through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to
complete the development of our product candidates. We may satisfy our future
cash needs through the sale of equity securities, debt financings, working
capital lines of credit, corporate collaborations or license agreements, grant
funding, through interest income earned on cash balances or a combination of one
or more of these sources. This expected use of net proceeds from this Offering
represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions,
which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the
status of and results from different preclinical and clinical trials, as well as
any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our programs,
and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds. We cannot specify with
certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon
the closing of this Offering."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the NYSE American stock
    exchange listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been
    paid from the funds we borrowed from our sponsor. These funds will be repaid
    out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) Our sponsor will pay the $500,000 in underwriting fees and qualified
    independent underwriter fees and receive a non-interest bearing promissory
    note in exchange for the payment of such amount. The promissory note will be
    payable at the closing of a business combination.

(3) The funds held in the trust account will be used to acquire a target
    business, to pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares for a
    portion of the funds held in the trust account and potentially to pay our
    expenses relating thereto. Our expenses relating to the acquisition of a
    target business would either come from the funds held in the trust account or
    additional funds otherwise available to us outside of the trust account,
    including cash held by the target business. Any remaining funds will be
    disbursed to the combined company and be used as working capital to finance
    the operations of the target business.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $875,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

A total of $10.00 per share (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private warrants described in this prospectus will be placed in a trust
account in the United States at Morgan Stanley, maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in U.S.
government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less
or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for
all interest income that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, as
discussed below, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released
from the trust account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (ii)
a redemption to public stockholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the
event we do not consummate our initial business combination within the
applicable period.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to use
from the trust account is minimal as a result of the current interest rate
environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor loaned us a total of $85,500 to
be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. The loans are
non-interest bearing and payable on the date on which we consummate the
offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private warrants to
purchase shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.40 per private
warrant (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued private
warrants to purchase 1,250,000 shares of common stock if $500,000 of notes were
so converted). Such private warrants will be identical to the private warrants
to be issued at the closing of this offering.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of common stock that
such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate our initial business combination within 24 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) if we seek to
amend our certificate of incorporation to affect the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem all public shares if we cannot complete an initial business
combination within 24 months of the closing of this offering and such amendment
is duly approved. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any shares they own in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination, including their founder shares and public shares
that they have purchased during or after the offering, if any. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions with respect to its founder shares if we fail to consummate our
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering.
However, if our initial stockholders acquire public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with
respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business
combination within the required time period."

approximately US$43.8 million, or approximately US$51.0 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for general corporate purposes.
According to our current plan, 40% of such net proceeds will be used in brand
promotions to facilitate our long-term brand building and marketing efforts, 30%
will be used in research and development as well as cultivating talents of our
team, and the remaining 30% will be used in other general corporate purposes
such as administrative expenses and potential acquisitions and strategic
investments, although we have not identified any near-term investment or
acquisition targets. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary
depending on the amount of cash generated by our operations, and the rate of
growth, if any, of our business.

Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus. 

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our WFOE only
through loans or capital contributions and to our VIE only through loans,
subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval
requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

offering will be approximately $43.7 million (or approximately $50.4 million if
the underwriters exercise their option in full to purchase additional shares of
our common stock), at the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

Consistent with our long-term strategy of conservatively deploying our capital
to achieve above average rates of return, we intend to use the net proceeds of
this offering to expand our retail presence in the geographic markets we now 
serve, particularly in the southern United States. Each retail center requires
between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 to acquire the location, situate an office, 
provide inventory, and allocate the initial working capital. We expect to open
10 to 15 additional retail centers by the end of 2020. We also expect, based on
our current financial position, that we will opportunistically increase our 
credit lines on terms that will allow us to rapidly expand the pace of our 
financing solutions for our retail consumers, giving our new retail centers the
support they need to generate sales.

We also expect to use a portion of the net proceeds to provide financing
solutions to a select group of our community-owner customers, in a manner that
includes developing new sites for products in or near urban locations where
there is a shortage of sites to place our products. These solutions will be
structured to give us an attractive return on investment, when coupled with the
gross margin we make on products specifically targeted for these new
manufactured housing communities.

Additionally, in the event a major acquisition opportunity develops, we will
evaluate and consider a geographical expansion or an expansion into affordable
housing niches in our current geographical markets that we believe will be
consistent with our long-term strategy of achieving above average rates of
return within the affordable housing industry.

We will use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for working
capital and general corporate purposes, including investing in our sales and
marketing, product enhancement efforts, and enhancing our corporate
infrastructure and systems to assist in creating a more robust means of tracking
data, automating back office functions, and improving our financial reporting
system. We may allocate funds from other sources to fund some or all of these
activities.

We do not intend to significantly leverage our balance sheet. Rather, we expect
that our debt-to-equity ratio will remain for the foreseeable future in our
historical range of 1-to-1, or less. We may allocate some of the proceeds for
paying down our current debt.

The intended use of net proceeds from this offering represents our expectations
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses described in this prospectus.
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in applying the
net proceeds of this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures
will be based on many factors, including cash flows from operations and the 
anticipated growth of our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the
net proceeds of this offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments,
including short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade 
securities."

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $250,000,000 (or $287,500,000  
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full) as well as   
    amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in   
    connection with our successful completion of our initial business            
    combination.                                                                 

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans   
    from Cantor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of         
    September 30, 2018, we had borrowed approximately $82,000 (of up to $300,000 
    available to us), which amount was unchanged as of November 30, 2018, under  
    the promissory note with Cantor to be used for a portion of the expenses of  
    this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon completion of this offering 
    out of the $650,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the     
    payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions). In the   
    event that offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, they  
    will be repaid using a portion of the $350,000 of offering proceeds not held 
    in the trust account and set aside for post-closing working capital expenses.
    In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table,   
    any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.     

(3) Upon completion of our initial business combination, the funds held in the   
    trust account, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming         
    stockholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion 
    of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial   
    business combination occurs, to pay the Marketing Fee of $8,750,000 (or      
    $10,062,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) 
    or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital.             

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be   
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or  
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For       
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. 
    In the event we identify an initial business combination target in a 
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due        
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,  
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,  
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any      
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.      

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment    
    fees for financing.                                                          

(6) Includes fees payable to our independent directors.                         

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
units, $252,500,000 (or $290,375,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full), including $2,500,000 (or $2,875,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of sponsor loans, will be placed in
a trust account in the United States at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $3.5 million per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.4% per year;
however, we can provide no assurance regarding this amount. Except with respect
to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released
to us to pay our tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering, the sale of
the private placement units and the sponsor loan will not be released from the
trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial
business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted
in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or (B)
with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or
pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18
months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account, as well as the
$30,000,000 private placement described elsewhere in this prospectus, for
general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations
of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements
we may enter into following consummation of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, together with the loan committed by
our sponsor for working capital, will be sufficient to pay the costs and
expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact
that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Prior to the closing of this offering, Cantor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
September 30, 2018, we had borrowed approximately $82,000, which amount was
unchanged as of November 30, 2018, under the promissory note with our sponsor to
be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2018
or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $350,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor has committed $750,000 to be
provided to us to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a
target business and other working capital requirements after this offering and
prior to our initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor or an
affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are
not obligated to, loan us additional funds as may be required. If we complete
our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the
proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be
repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up
to $1,500,000 of such loans (in the case of loans in excess of the initial
$750,000 loan commitment, only if such loans are made to us more than 90 days
after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus
forms a part) may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant
at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such additional loans by our officers and directors, if
any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to
such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor
or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account.

Our sponsor has committed, pursuant to a forward purchase contract with us, to
purchase, in a private placement for gross proceeds of $30,000,000 to occur
concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination,
3,000,000 of our units on substantially the same terms as the sale of units in
this offering at $10.00 per unit, and 750,000 shares of Class A common stock.
The funds from the sale of units will be used as part of the consideration to
the sellers in the initial business combination; any excess funds from this
private placement will be used for working capital in the post-transaction
company. This commitment is independent of the percentage of stockholders
electing to redeem their public shares and provides us with a minimum funding
level for the initial business combination.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors,
officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in
privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or
following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit
on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance
with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments,
plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any
terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such
transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession
of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such
purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares or
private placement shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor
or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or
after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the
trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our
initial business combination within the prescribed time frame."
TENCENT MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT GROUP,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tencent-music-entertainment-group-1065721-88039,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/tencent-music-entertainment-group-1065721-88039,424B4,12/12/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13104971,"Based on the initial public offering price of US$13.00 per ADS, we expect to
receive (i) net proceeds of approximately US$505 million in the aggregate (or
net proceeds of approximately US$658 million in the aggregate if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full in connection with
this offering) from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us; and (ii) additional
net proceeds of approximately US$32 million from the concurrent private
placement to Tencent to effect its Assured Entitlement Distribution (assuming
Tencent’s full subscription of the Class A ordinary shares to be issued by us in
such concurrent private placement). We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the sale of the ADSs being sold by the selling shareholders.

We plan to use such net proceeds primarily for the following purposes:

• approximately 40% for investment to enhance our music content offerings to
  improve the variety, quality and quantity of content on our platform;     

• approximately 30% for product and service development to expand and enhance
  our current product and service offerings, as well as to develop  new products
  and services to further enhance user engagement;             

• approximately 15% for selling and marketing, including marketing and
  promotions to strengthen our brand and grow our paying user base; and     

• approximately 15% for potential strategic investments and acquisitions and
  general corporate purposes.                                               

If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the
proceeds differently than as described in this prospectus. In utilizing the
proceeds, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to
our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, and to our
consolidated VIEs only through loans, and only if we satisfy the applicable
government registration and approval requirements. The relevant filing and
registration processes for capital contributions typically take approximately
eight weeks to complete. The filing and registration processes for loans
typically take approximately four weeks or longer to complete. While we
currently see no material obstacles to completing the filing and registration
procedures with respect to future capital contributions and loans to our PRC
subsidiaries or VIEs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete
these filings and registrations on a timely basis, or at all. Additionally,
while there is no statutory limit on the amount of capital contribution that we
can make to our PRC subsidiaries, loans provided to our PRC subsidiaries and
consolidated VIEs in the PRC are subject to certain statutory limits. With
respect to our PRC subsidiaries, the maximum amount of the loans that they can
acquire in aggregate from outside China as of September 30, 2018 is (i)
approximately US$10.3 million under the total investment minus registered
capital approach; or (ii) approximately US$846.9 million under the net asset
approach. With respect to our VIEs and their subsidiaries, the maximum amount of
the loans that they can obtain in aggregate from outside China as of September
30, 2018 is approximately US$1,116.4 million under the net asset approach. We
are able to use all of the net proceeds from this offering for investment in our
PRC operations by funding our PRC subsidiaries through capital contributions
which is not subject to any statutory limit on the amount under PRC laws and
regulations. We expect the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement to be used in the PRC will be in the form of RMB and,
therefore, our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs will need to convert any
capital contributions or loans from U.S. dollars into Renminbi in accordance
with applicable PRC laws and regulations. All of the net proceeds from this
offering and the concurrent private placement would be available for investment
in our operations in the PRC, subject to the foregoing statutory limits on the
amount of loans provided to our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs in the
PRC and the laws and regulations on the conversion from U.S. dollars into
Renminbi.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, financial instruments or demand deposits."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we        
    borrowed from our sponsor described below. These funds will be repaid out of 
    the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants 
    available to us.                                                             

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the 
    private placement warrants.                                                  

(3) We are obligated to pay to EarlyBirdCapital a fee in an amount equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering for serving as an advisor in          
    connection with our business combination (provided that we have the right to 
    allocate up to 35% of the fee to any of the underwriters in this offering or 
    other FINRA member firms we retain to assist us in connection with our       
    initial business combination). Accordingly, upon completion of our initial   
    business combination, $4,550,000 (or up to $5,232,500 if the underwriters’   
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to such parties from
    the funds held in the trust account.                                         

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at             
    approximately $900,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.              

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these   
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may    
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in    
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not   
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     

Our sponsor has committed to purchase the 4,150,000 private placement warrants
from us for a purchase price of $4,150,000 on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Our sponsor also agreed
that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in
part, it will purchase from us up to an additional 390,000 private placement
warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. These additional private placement
warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously
with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment
option. The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants being sold
as part of the units in this offering, subject to certain limited exceptions as
described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the proceeds we receive from
these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below.

$130,000,000, or $149,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants
will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in
trust will be invested only in United States “government securities” within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraph
(d) under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed
to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with
respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us to pay our franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds
will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion
of a business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public
shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time
period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to our sponsor of a monthly fee of an aggregate of up to $10,000 is
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our
benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated officers and
directors with compensation in lieu of a salary. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the
trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the up to $10,000 per month
fee and the repayment of loans from our sponsor (none of which payments will be
made from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial
business combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor,
officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered
to us after the date of this prospectus and prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, such entity and individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Our
audit committee will review all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor,
officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates on a quarterly basis,
with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. There is
no limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however,
that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in
the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate an initial business combination. Since the role of present management
after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$900,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business,
with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsor, officers and directors in
connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale
of the private placement warrants, including the funds held in the trust
account, to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto,
including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds
raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might
become payable, and subject to our right to allocate up to 35% of the fee to any
of the underwriters in this offering or other FINRA member firms we retain to
assist us in connection with our initial business combination) upon consummation
of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection with our
initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in 
whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds
held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business 
combination (including to pay converting stockholders as described herein) will
be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net 
proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of 
the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of 
ways including continuing or expanding the target business’s operations, for 
strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing 
or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account
and any available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account of
$150,000 that we are permitted to withdraw.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced us an aggregate of
$200,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA filing
fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the
legal and audit fees and expenses. The advances will be payable without interest
on the consummation of this offering. The advances will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants
available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of
the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. If we do not
complete a business combination, the loans will be forgiven.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer,
in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek
to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would affect the substance or timing of the ability of our public
stockholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a
business combination or of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if
we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of
this offering. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of
any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director
nominee, or any other person. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."
"SYNTHORX, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/synthorx-inc-936607-88360,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/synthorx-inc-936607-88360,424B4,12/7/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=13099528,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $118.8 million
(or approximately $137.0 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common
stock offered by us in this offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

. approximately $60.0 million to fund development of THOR-707 through dose   
  escalation and expansion trials as a single agent and in combination with an 
  immune checkpoint inhibitor;                                            

. approximately $10.0 million to fund development of our IL-2 AI Synthorin,  
  including completion of IND enabling studies and the initiation of a single
  ascending dose study;                                                      

. approximately $10.0 million to fund development of our IL-10 Synthorin into
  preclinical development and first-in-human clinical trials; and            

. the remaining proceeds to fund our development of our IL-15 Synthorin, as  
  well as advancing our earlier stage undisclosed cytokine programs and other
  general corporate purposes, which may include the hiring of additional     
  personnel, capital expenditures and the costs of operating as a public 
  company.                                                                   

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to in-license,
acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or
assets. However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash, including the net proceeds from the sale of our Series C preferred stock
sale in November 2018, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at
least the next 12 months from the date of this offering. In particular, we
expect that the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to report clinical
biomarker proof-of-concept data for THOR-707 as a single agent and in
combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, identify a product candidate in
the IL-2 AI Synthorin program, complete IND enabling studies for such program
and initiate a single ascending dose study for such program, and identify
development candidates for our IL-10 and IL-15 Synthorin programs. We may
require additional funds to report such biomarker proof-of concept data,
identify a product candidate in the IL-2 AI Synthorin program and complete IND
enabling studies for such program, and/or identify development candidates for
our IL-10 and IL-15 Synthorin programs. It is difficult to predict the cost and
timing required to complete our development programs due to, among other
factors, our lack of experience with initiating and conducting preclinical
studies and clinical trials, the rate of subject enrollment in our clinical
trials, filing requirements with various regulatory agencies, preclinical and
clinical results, and the actual costs of manufacturing our product candidates.
The proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to fund development of
our product candidates through regulatory approval and commercialization. To
obtain the capital necessary to fund our product candidates through regulatory
approval and commercialization we may need to enter into additional public or
private equity offerings, debt financings or collaborations and licensing
arrangements or seek out other capital sources.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including the progress, cost and results of our preclinical and
clinical development programs, our ability to obtain additional financing,
whether we are able to enter into future licensing or collaboration arrangements
and other factors described, as well as the amount of cash used in our 
operations and any unforeseen cash needs. We may find it necessary or advisable
to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and our management will have broad 
discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying
on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from this 
offering.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

offering will be approximately $14.9 million based on the initial public
offering price of $4.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund clinical
development of DM199, to conduct research activities and for working capital and
general corporate purposes. We expect the net proceeds of this offering to be
sufficient to allow us to complete our current Phase II Remedy trial in patients
with acute ischemic stroke and a Phase 1b and Phase II study in patients with
chronic kidney disease. We do not expect the net proceeds of this offering to be
sufficient to fund, and we expect to require additional funding to complete, the
development of DM199 through regulatory approval and commercialization, which we
may seek through public or private equity or debt financings or through
collaborations with other biotechnology companies or other sources. The expected
use of the net proceeds from the offering represents our intentions based upon
our current plans and business conditions. As of the date of this prospectus, we
cannot predict with any certainty all of the particular uses for the net
proceeds or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of product
development and commercialization may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors, including the status, results and timing of our planned clinical
trials, as well as any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Pending their use as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. You
will not have an opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other
information on which we base our decisions regarding the use of these proceeds."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $564.1 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $23.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
shares, our estimated net proceeds will be approximately $649.8 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock and thereby facilitate future access to the public equity markets,
increase our visibility in the marketplace and obtain additional capital. We
currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following:

• approximately $380.0 million to $420.0 million to fund drug discovery and    
  clinical development, further expansion of our manufacturing platform and    
  capabilities, and infrastructure to support our pipeline;                    

• approximately $90.0 million to $100.0 million to fund further development of 
  our mRNA technology platform and the creation of new modalities; and         

• the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above and we expect
that we will require additional funds in order to fully accomplish the specified
uses of the proceeds of this offering. We may also use a portion of the net
proceeds to in-license, acquire, or invest in complementary businesses or
technologies to continue to build our pipeline, research and development
capabilities and our intellectual property position, although we currently have
no agreements, commitments, or understandings with respect to any such
transaction.

Due to the many inherent uncertainties in the development of our mRNA medicines,
the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our research and
development, the timing of patient enrollment and evolving regulatory
requirements, the timing and success of preclinical studies, our ongoing
clinical studies or clinical studies we may commence in the future, the timing
of regulatory submissions, any strategic alliances that we may enter into with
third parties for our investigational medicines or strategic opportunities that
become available to us, and any unforeseen cash needs.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation instruments, including
short-term and long-term interest-bearing instruments, investment-grade
securities, and direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. We
cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return. Our
management will retain broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
we receive from our initial public offering, and investors will be relying on

underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting

payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately 30% to develop and expand our content offering;

• approximately 30% to continue to invest in and develop our technology;

• approximately 20% to deepen collaboration with merchants and brand

  not identified any specific investments or acquisition opportunities at
  this time.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and

management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.
