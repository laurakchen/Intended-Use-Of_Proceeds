after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and a $1.0 million
structuring fee, but before estimated net expenses associated with the offering
and related formation transactions.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to:
 
    •  distribute approximately $224.5 million to Enterprise Products OLP as a    
       portion of the cash consideration and reimbursement for capital            
       expenditures relating to the assets contributed to us;                     
   
    •  provide approximately $28.2 million to fund our 66% share of estimated     
       capital expenditures to complete planned expansions to the South Texas NGL 
       pipeline system and brine production and above-ground storage projects at  
       Mont Belvieu subsequent to the closing of this offering; and               
   
    •  pay approximately $2.9 million of other estimated net expenses associated  
       with this offering and related formation transactions. 
 
The portion of net proceeds that we retain to fund planned expansions (and the
amount that we plan to distribute to Enterprise Products OLP) assumes that,
prior to the closing date of this offering, South Texas NGL and Mont Belvieu
Caverns will have recorded $59 million of a total estimated additional cost of
$101.7 million to complete our acquisition and construction of the South Texas
NGL pipeline system and our completion of brine production and above-ground
storage projects at Mont Belvieu. The amounts actually distributed or retained
at the closing of this offering will be increased or decreased by an amount
equal to 66% of the difference between:
 
    (1)  $101.7 million (the estimated total additional costs); and               
   
    (2)  the actual construction and acquisition costs paid with respect to       
         (i) the South Texas NGL pipeline (excluding the original pipeline        
         purchase costs of approximately $97.7 million) and (ii) the Mont Belvieu 
         brine production and above-ground storage projects, prior to the         
         contribution of interests in South Texas NGL and Mont Belvieu Caverns to 
         us at the closing of this offering.                                      

Of the $59 million in total estimated costs noted above, as of December 31,
2006, we had recorded $19.6 million of the estimated additional costs for
construction and acquisition of the South Texas NGL pipeline system and
$21.3 million of the estimated additional costs related to the Mont Belvieu
brine production and above-ground storage projects.
 
Concurrently with the closing of this offering, we will also borrow
approximately $200 million under our new $300 million credit agreement. We will
distribute $198.9 million of these borrowings to Enterprise Products OLP in
partial consideration for the assets contributed to us upon the closing of this
offering. 
 
If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units,
we will use all of the net proceeds from the sale of those common units to
redeem an equal number of common units from Enterprise Products OLP, which may
be deemed a selling unitholder in this offering"
"EMPLOYERS HOLDINGS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/employers-holdings-inc-724944-52539,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/employers-holdings-inc-724944-52539,424B1,1/31/2007,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4914042,"We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock in the
offering will be approximately $425.2 million, or $489.0 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us, and we estimate
that the proceeds available to eligible members as cash consideration in the
conversion, which equals those net procceds less estimated conversion and
offering expenses, will be $408.6 million, or $472.4 million if the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full.

The plan of conversion requires us to use all or a portion of the net proceeds
(after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions) (1) first, to pay all
fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with the conversion and this
offering and all cash consideration payable to all eligible members of EIG who
are not eligible to receive our common stock in the conversion (which we refer
to in this prospectus collectively as the ‘‘mandatory cash requirements’’), and
(2) next, to pay the cash consideration payable to eligible members of EIG who
elect to receive cash instead of our common stock (which we refer to in this
prospectus as the ‘‘elective cash requirements’’). Based on the number of cash
elections received from our members, and assuming that the underwriters do not
exercise their over-allotment option, no net proceeds will remain after all of
the foregoing amounts have been paid in full. The net proceeds of any exercise
of the underwriters’ over-allotment option will be used first to fund any
portion of the elective cash requirements that are not funded in full by the net
proceeds of the offering before such exercise, and EIG may retain and use any
remaining amounts from such exercise for working capital, payment of future
dividends on the common stock, repurchases of shares of common stock and other
general corporate purposes.

We will use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:
                 
                  •                 $10.5 million is estimated to be required for 
                                    the cost of the non-recurring fees and        
                                    expenses directly related to the conversion;  
                 
                  •                 $6.1 million is estimated to be required for  
                                    the cost of the non-recurring fees and        
                                    expenses directly related to this offering;   
                  
                  •                 $11.7 million is estimated to be necessary to 
                                    provide consideration to members eligible     
                                    solely for cash; and                          
                    
                  •                 $396.9 million is estimated to be used to make
                                    elective cash payments to those eligible      
                                    members that elect to receive this form of    
                                    consideration in the conversion.              

In the event that the net proceeds from this offering and the exercise of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option (after payment of all mandatory cash
requirements) are not sufficient to fund the distribution of cash consideration
to all eligible members electing to receive cash instead of common stock, the
remaining proceeds will be allocated pro rata among all eligible members
electing to receive cash, in proportion to the number of shares allocated to
such eligible members pursuant to the allocation provisions of the plan of
conversion (with adjustments to prevent the creation of any odd-lots or the
issuance of any fractional shares).

The maximum number of allocated shares for which cash will be available will
depend on a number of factors, including the amount of net proceeds from this
offering and the percentage of eligible members who have elected to receive
cash.

In addition to the shares of our common stock distributed in this offering, for
which we will receive cash proceeds, many eligible members entitled to receive
consideration in the conversion will receive shares of our common stock
distributed in connection with the conversion as consideration for
extinguishment of their membership interests in us. We will not receive any
proceeds from the issuance of our common stock to eligible members entitled to
receive consideration in the conversion for the extinguishment of their
membership interests in us."

estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $235.7 million, or
approximately $271.6 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option
to purchase additional shares. We will use these proceeds, as well as any
proceeds received from the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares, to purchase from HFF Holdings all of the shares of Holliday
GP and partnership units representing approximately 39% of each of the Operating
Partnerships, or partnership units representing 45% of each of the Operating
Partnerships if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares. HFF Holdings will use approximately $56.3 million of the sale
proceeds to repay all outstanding borrowings under HFF LP’s credit agreement.
Accordingly, we will not retain any of the proceeds from this offering.
 
At our request, the underwriters have reserved for sale to our employees,
directors and families of employees and directors at the initial public offering
price up to 5% of the shares being offered by this prospectus. See
“Underwriting” for more information. In connection with the sale of these
reserved shares, we have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain
liabilities, including those that may be caused by the failure of the
participants in the reserved share program to pay for and accept delivery of the
shares of Class A common stock which were subject to a properly confirmed
agreement to purchase. As a result, we may be required to make payments to the
underwriters if participants in the reserved share program fail to pay for and
accept delivery of the shares of Class A common stock which were subject to a
properly confirmed agreement to purchase and, as a result, we must indemnify the
underwriters for such failure.
 
HFF LP’s credit agreement consists of a senior secured term loan facility in an
aggregate amount of $60 million and a senior secured revolving credit facility
in an aggregate amount of $20 million. Borrowings under the credit agreement
bear interest at the applicable thirty-day London Interbank Offered Rate, or
LIBOR rate (5.32% at September 30, 2006), plus 250 basis points. We have the
option to convert revolving credit borrowings, subject to certain restrictions,
to Base Rate Notes which bear interest at the Base Rate (defined as the greater
of (a) the federal funds rate (5.34% at September 30, 2006) plus 50 basis
points, and the (b) prime rate, as determined pursuant to the credit agreement
(8.25% at September 30, 2006)), plus 150 basis points. As of September 30, 2006,
we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $57,500,000 under our term loan
facility bearing interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 7.7% and
no borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of January 1, 2007, we had
outstanding borrowings of approximately $56,273,000 under our term loan facility
bearing interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 7.7% and no
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The credit agreement
matures on March 29, 2010, subject to our option to extend the maturity date an
additional 12 months upon the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in
the credit agreement. Proceeds from these borrowings have been used for
distribution payments to the members of HFF Holdings.
 
An affiliate of Banc of America Securities LLC is the lender under our credit
agreement and, based on the initial public offering price per share of $18.00
and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares, will receive approximately 23.9% of the proceeds of this offering of
shares of Class A common stock used to repay those borrowings."

                  combination. The underwriters shall not be entitled to any     
                  interest earned on such deferred amounts.                      
                                  
(3)               The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust
                  will remain constant at $50,000 even if the over-allotment is  
                  exercised. In addition, $1,875,000 of interest income earned on
                  the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us  
                  to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of   
                  presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the  
                  total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately       
                  following the offering. The trust fund will be invested in     
                  United States ‘‘government securities’’ within the meaning of  
                  Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a  
                  maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting  
                  certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the       
                  Investment Company Act of 1940. Based on information we have   
                  received from Smith Barney, such securities currently yield    
                  between 4.75% and 5.30% per annum before taxes. Accordingly, we
                  believe we will have sufficient income to draw the entire      
                  $1,875,000 available for our working capital requirements.     

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, RAC Partners, an entity
controlled by Barry W. Florescue, our chairman and chief executive officer, and
certain of our directors committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an
aggregate purchase price of $2,100,000) from us. This purchase will take place
on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this
offering. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the
purchase of the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this
purchase will be placed in the trust fund described below.

$88,625,600, or $102,047,840 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $2,100,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Smith Barney,
a division of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes a
portion of the underwriting discounts and commissions, including the
non-accountable expense allowance, payable to the underwriters in this offering.
The underwriters have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until
we consummate a business combination and have waived their right to receive such
payment upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business
combination. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
‘‘government securities’’ within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to
interest income that may be released to us of (i) up to $1,875,000 to fund
expenses related to investigating and selecting a target business and our other
working capital requirements and (ii) any additional amounts we may need to pay
our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds held in trust will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

The payment to BMD Management Company, an affiliate of Barry W. Florescue, our
chairman and chief executive officer, of a monthly fee of $8,000 is for general
and administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by BMD Management Company for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Florescue compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the
Miami-Ft. Lauderdale, Florida metropolitan area, that the fee charged by BMD
Management Company is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a
business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
stockholders. Other than the $8,000 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination. However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine
their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the
funds not held in trust and currently allocated to ‘‘Due diligence of
prospective target businesses by officers, directors and existing
stockholders’’. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $50,000. In addition, interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account, up to $1,875,000, may be released to us
to fund our working capital requirements. These funds will be used by us for
director and officer liability insurance premiums, due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our
behalf as described above. We will also be entitled to have interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay certain tax
obligations that we may owe. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could also use a portion of
these funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
business or to use as a down payment or to fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision (a
provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from
‘‘shopping’’ around for transactions with other companies on terms more
favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If
we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down
payment or to fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision would be determined based on the
terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds
at the time. While we do not expect to make such payments if our ability to
continue our search for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, potential
target businesses would be adversely affected, our forfeiture of such funds
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, potential target businesses. Our initial stockholders are under no
obligation to advance additional funds if the interest earned on the trust
account is not adequate or the entire $1,875,000 is used prior to the end of the
period provided for consummation of a business combination.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States ‘‘government
securities’’ within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net
proceeds during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or
finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business
combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust fund were
insufficient to cover such expenses.

Barry W. Florescue has advanced to us a total of $150,000 which was or will be
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, a portion of the
non-accountable expense allowance and legal and audit fees and expenses. The
loan, which we expect will be purchased by RAC Partners prior to the
consummation of this offering, will be payable without interest on the earlier
of April 30, 2007 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering
expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

offering, based on the initial public offering price of $8.00 per share, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, our estimated net proceeds will be approximately $22.9 million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.
 
We currently intend to use the proceeds of this offering as follows:
 
    •  approximately $6.3 million to expand our sales and marketing capabilities, 
       including the expansion of our direct sales force in Europe and the United 
       States;                                                                    
   
    •  approximately $13.0 million to fund clinical trials and related research;  
       and                                                                        
   
    •  the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working   
       capital.                                                                   

Because we did not raise gross proceeds of $30.0 million or more in this
offering, we are not required to repay at the completion of this offering the
$4.0 million in principal and approximately $35,000 of accrued interest on our
$4.0 million Bridge Loan from one of our directors, Robert Burlingame. The
Bridge Loan becomes due on November 10, 2007 and accrues additional interest at
an annual rate of 7%. We expect to repay the principal and outstanding interest
with cash remaining from this offering, if any, cash generated from operations,
or from other sources, which we would determine at the time the Bridge Loan
becomes due . However, we have a history of losses from operations and may never
achieve profitability, and we may not be able to secure additional financing on
acceptable terms, if at all.
 
While we have estimated the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received
upon the completion of this offering, the actual amounts and timing of any
expenditures will depend upon the rate of growth, if any, of our business, the
amount of cash generated by our operations, status of our research and
development efforts, competitive and technological developments and the amount
of proceeds actually raised in this offering. A portion of the net proceeds may
also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies,
services or products, although we have no agreements with respect to any such
transactions as of the date of this prospectus. Accordingly, our management will
have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering.
Pending these uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, investment grade securities.
 
We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, the Series C Financing and
the Bridge Loan, together with our future revenues, cash and cash equivalent
balances and interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our
anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months."

     NASD filing fee, will be paid from the $210,000 non-interest bearing loan   
     from our officers and directors, as further described below. We intend to   
     repay these loans out of the net proceeds of this offering not being placed 
     in trust upon consummation of this offering, provided the amount held in    
     trust remains at least 95% of the offering gross proceeds.                  
                                                                                 
(2)  Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this    
     offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 2%,  
     or $720,000 to be held in trust ($828,000 if the underwriters over-allotment
     option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business transaction.  
                                                                                 
(3)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust will be $700,000 even if the       
     over-allotment is exercised.                                                
                                                                                 
(4)  No interest earned on the funds held in trust will be used to pay any of the
     expenses (except with respect to any taxes payable).                        

     The amount of $34,200,000, or $39,330,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the net proceeds of this offering
and the purchase of the founding warrants, will be placed in a trust account at
JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as
trustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The proceeds will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business
combination or the liquidation of the trust account. The proceeds held in the
trust account (exclusive of any taxes and any funds held for the benefit of the
underwriters) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as
determined by our board of directors at that time. Because we do not have any
specific business combination under consideration and have not (nor has anyone
on our behalf) had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to such a
transaction, it is impossible at this time to determine specifically how we
would, following a business combination, use any proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate such business combination.

     We have agreed to pay Global Vestor Capital Partners LLC, an affiliate of
Jin Shi, our chief executive officer and director, and Michael Zhang, our chief
financial officer, secretary and director, up to $7,500 per month for office
space, utilities, administrative, technology and secretarial services. This
arrangement is being agreed to by Global Vestor Capital Partners LLC for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Shi or Mr. Zhang compensation in lieu
of salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in Shanghai,
PRC, that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a
business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
shareholders.

     Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $700,000. We intend to use the excess
working capital (approximately $120,000) for director and officer liability
insurance premiums (approximately $50,000), with the balance of $70,000 being
held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as
well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any of our
existing shareholders in connection with activities on our behalf (including
possible payments to unaffiliated third-parties for their performance of due
diligence). We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to
cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

     We could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to engage
consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also
use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust as a down payment or to
fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep
target businesses from “shopping around” for transactions with other companies
on terms more favorable to such target business) with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. If we entered into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to
receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the
terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds
at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

     To the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account and other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

     Certain of our officers and directors have agreed to loan us a total of
$210,000, which will be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering,
such as transfer agent fees, SEC registration fees, NASD registration fees, blue
sky expenses, background investigation expenses, printing expenses, and legal
and accounting fees and expenses. We intend to repay these loans from the
proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust, provided the amount held in
trust remains at least 95% of the offering gross proceeds.

     The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities” or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act, as amended. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of this
offering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed to be an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. We
believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

     Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the
consummation of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Global
Vestor Capital Partners LLC the $7,500 monthly fee described above. However, our
existing shareholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations (including possible payments to unaffiliated third parties
for their performance of due diligence) and for out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with this offering. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid
by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated in the above
table “Working capital, director and officer liability insurance premiums and
reserves.” To the extent that such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account such out-of-pocket expenses would
not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination, in which
event this reimbursement obligation would in all likelihood be negotiated with
the owners of a target business. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

     A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, net of taxes payable, which taxes, if any, shall be paid from the trust
account) only in the event of our automatic dissolution and subsequent
liquidation of the trust account upon our failure to complete a business
combination or if that public shareholder were to redeem such shares into cash
in connection with a business combination which the public shareholder voted
against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account."

(1)  A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee and   
     NASD filing fee, will be paid from the $210,000 non-interest bearing loan    
     from our officers and directors, as further described below. We intend to    
     repay these loans out of the net proceeds of this offering not being placed  
     in trust upon consummation of this offering, provided the amount held in     
     trust remains at least 95% of the offering gross proceeds.                   
                                                                                  
(2)  Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this     
     offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 2%, or
     $720,000 to be held in trust ($828,000 if the underwriters over-allotment    
     option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business transaction.   
                                                                                  
(3)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust will be $700,000 even if the        
     over-allotment is exercised.                                                 
                                                                                  
(4)  No interest earned on the funds held in trust will be used to pay any of the 
     expenses (except with respect to any taxes payable).                         

     The amount of $34,200,000, or $39,330,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the net proceeds of this offering
and the purchase of the founding warrants, will be placed in a trust account at
JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as
trustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The proceeds will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business
combination or the liquidation of the trust account. The proceeds held in the
trust account (exclusive of any taxes and any funds held for the benefit of the
underwriters) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as
determined by our board of directors at that time. Because we do not have any
specific business combination under consideration and have not (nor has anyone
on our behalf) had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to such a
transaction, it is impossible at this time to determine specifically how we
would, following a business combination, use any proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate such business combination.

     We have agreed to pay Global Vestor Capital Partners LLC, an affiliate of
Jin Shi, our chief financial officer and director, and Michael Zhang, our chief
executive officer, secretary and director, up to $7,500 per month for office
space, utilities, administrative, technology and secretarial services. This
arrangement is being agreed to by Global Vestor Capital Partners LLC for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Shi or Mr. Zhang compensation in lieu
of salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in Shanghai,
PRC, that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a
business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
shareholders.

     Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $700,000. We intend to use the excess
working capital (approximately $120,000) for director and officer liability
insurance premiums (approximately $50,000), with the balance of $70,000 being
held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as
well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any of our
existing shareholders in connection with activities on our behalf (including
possible payments to unaffiliated third parties for their performance of due
diligence). We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to
cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

     We could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to engage
consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also
use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust as a down payment or to
fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep
target businesses from “shopping around” for transactions with other companies
on terms more favorable to such target business) with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. If we entered into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to
receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the
terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds
at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

     To the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account and other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

     Certain of our officers and directors have agreed to loan us a total of
$210,000, which will be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering,
such as transfer agent fees, SEC registration fees, NASD registration fees, blue
sky expenses, background investigation expenses, printing expenses, and legal
and accounting fees and expenses. We intend to repay these loans from the
proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust, provided the amount held in
trust remains at least 95% of the offering gross proceeds.

     The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities” or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act, as amended. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of this
offering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed to be an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. We
believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

     Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the
consummation of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Global
Vestor Capital Partners LLC the $7,500 monthly fee described above. However, our
existing shareholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations (including possible payments to unaffiliated third parties
for their performance of due diligence) and for out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with this offering. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid
by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated in the above
table “Working capital, director and officer liability insurance premiums and

proceeds not deposited in the trust account such out-of-pocket expenses would
not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination, in which
event this reimbursement obligation would in all likelihood be negotiated with
the owners of a target business. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

     A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, net of taxes payable, which taxes, if any, shall be paid from the trust
account) only in the event of our automatic dissolution and subsequent
liquidation of the trust account upon our failure to complete a business
combination or if that public shareholder were to redeem such shares into cash
in connection with a business combination which the public shareholder voted
against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account."

shares of our common stock in this offering, including the shares to be sold
directly to Mr. Meruelo or an entity controlled by Mr. Meruelo, will be
approximately $369.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discount of
approximately $25.9 million and estimated offering expenses of approximately
$5.0 million that we expect to pay in connection with this offering. We will
contribute the net proceeds of this offering to our operating partnership in
exchange for common units of limited partnership interest.

The underwriters have an option to purchase up to an additional 5,550,000 shares
of our common stock in this offering, less the underwriting discount, within 30
days after the date of this prospectus solely to cover over-allotments, if any.

We expect our operating partnership will use the net proceeds as follows:

    •   approximately $88.5 million to pay off approximately $86.5 million of net  
        principal mortgage debt instruments secured by certain of the projects we  
        will acquire in the formation transactions and approximately $2.0 million  
        in related accrued interest and penalties;                           

    •   approximately $176.8 million to pay off $150.0 million in principal amount 
        of debt of our predecessor business under the revolving credit facility    
        with CalPERS and approximately $26.8 million in related current and accrued
        deferred interest (the facility matures on February 12, 2010, bears current
        fixed interest at 6.5% annually with an accrued and deferred fixed interest
        rate of an additional 11.5% payable at maturity or asset disposition and   
        will be terminated if we are unable to agree on a satisfactory amendment to
        its terms in connection with this offering);                               

    •   approximately $4.6 million to pay off principal and accrued interest on a  
        note due February 15, 2007 and bears interest at Prime + 1.25% (9.5% at    
        September 30, 2006) annually held by Mr. Meruelo who advanced funds to our 
        predecessor business for development activities;                           

    •   approximately $2.8 million to fund the cash portion of the contribution    
        value of the entities owning our projects, which cash is approximately     
        equal to the taxes the contributors and their owners will owe as a result

        net proceeds as a result of the exercise of the over-allotment option by   
        the underwriters, if any, for working capital purposes, including (a)      
        funding the costs of redeveloping our portfolio, (b) funding a portion of  
        our acquisition of interests in five of our projects subject to purchase   
        rights having an aggregate purchase price of approximately $120.1 million  
        that we will indirectly assume, which projects we intend to purchase       
        following this offering, in part, using funds from borrowings secured by   
        our existing projects (however, we cannot assure you that we will obtain   
        such financings necessary to acquire those projects on favorable terms, if 
        at all), (c) funding the acquisition of other projects that we may identify
        in the future, (d) any additional expenses to upgrade our systems and      
        personnel as needed to meet the financial reporting and other requirements 
        for accounting, internal audit and other management systems and resources  
        that may be required and (e) for other general purposes.                   

Pending the use of any cash proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds
temporarily in interest-bearing, short-term investment-grade securities,
money-market accounts or checking accounts. Such investments may include, for
example, government and government agency certificates, certificates of deposit,
interest-bearing bank deposits and mortgage loan participations. These
investments are expected to provide a lower return than we expect to achieve
from our intended investment in our development and redevelopment projects."

have net proceeds of $104.0 million, we intend to distribute the net proceeds as
follows:

     •   $52.0 million (50.0% of the net proceeds) will be contributed to Oritani  
         Savings Bank;

We may use the net proceeds of the stock offering to invest in securities, to
deposit funds in Oritani Savings Bank, to finance the possible acquisition of
other financial institutions or financial service businesses, to pay dividends
or for other general corporate purposes, including repurchasing shares of our
common stock. Oritani Savings Bank may use the proceeds it receives to make
loans, to purchase securities, to expand its banking franchise internally,
through branching or through acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes.
Additionally, Oritani Savings Bank intends to contribute $1.0 million in cash to
the OritaniSavingsBank Charitable Foundation. Neither Oritani Savings Bank nor 
Oritani Financial Corp. is considering any specific material acquisition 
transaction at this time.

----
Although we will not be able to determine the amount of actual net proceeds we
will receive from the sale of shares of common stock until the stock offering is
completed, we anticipate that the net proceeds will be between $76.7 million and
$104.0 million, or $119.8 million if the stock offering is increased by 15%.

(1) As adjusted to give effect to a 15% increase in the number of shares of      
    common stock outstanding after the stock offering which could occur due to an
    increase in the maximum of the independent valuation as a result of          
    regulatory considerations, demand for the shares, or changes in market       
    conditions or general economic conditions following the commencement of the  
    stock offering.                                                              

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the stock offering
may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase
if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not
purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering. Payments for
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result
in the receipt of new funds for investment but will result in a reduction of
Oritani Savings Bank’s deposits. In all instances, Oritani Savings Bank will
receive at least 50% of the net proceeds of the stock offering.

We are undertaking the stock offering at this time in order to increase our
capital and have the capital resources available to expand and diversify our
business. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Business Strategy.” The stock
offering proceeds will increase our capital resources and the amount of funds
available to us for lending and investment purposes. The proceeds will
also give us greater flexibility to diversify operations, expand our branch
network and expand the products and services we offer to our customers.

Oritani Financial Corp. may use the proceeds it retains from the stock offering:

     •   to finance the purchase of shares of common stock in the stock offering by
         the employee stock ownership plan;                                        

     •   to continue to originate loans in which Oritani Financial Corp. or one of 
         its subsidiaries has an equity interest, although there are no specific   
         loans contemplated at this time;                                          

     •   to invest in additional real estate projects, as appropriate, although    
         there are no specific real estate investments contemplated at this time;  

     •   to invest in securities;

     •   to deposit funds in Oritani Savings Bank;

     •   to repurchase its shares of common stock;

     •   to pay dividends to our stockholders;

     •   to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches and other   
         financial services businesses, although no material transactions are being
         considered at this time; and                                              

     •   for general corporate purposes.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the stock offering,
except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory
approval. The loan that will be used to fund the purchases by the employee stock
ownership plan will accrue interest.

Oritani Savings Bank may use the proceeds it receives from the stock offering:

     •   to support the development of our multi-family and commercial real estate 
         loan portfolio;                                                           

     •   to expand our retail banking franchise by establishing de novo branches or
         by acquiring existing branches. Oritani Financial Corp. has acquired a    
         parcel of land in Emerson, New Jersey for potential development as a de   
         novo branch location and, as of October 2006, an application has been     
         submitted to the town of Emerson, New Jersey for development approval;    

     •   to expand our retail banking franchise by acquiring other financial       
         institutions or other financial services companies, although no material  
         acquisitions are specifically being considered at this time;              

     •   to support new products and services;

     •   to invest in securities; and
 
     •   for general corporate purposes.

Oritani Savings Bank intends to contribute $1.0 million in cash to the
OritaniSavingsBank Charitable Foundation.

The use of the proceeds outlined above may change, based on changes in interest
rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial services
industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall
market conditions. We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to our
performance in recent years until we are able to utilize effectively the
additional capital raised in the stock offering. Until we can increase our net
interest income and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity to be
below the industry average, which may negatively affect the value of our common
stock."

($80.8 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full)
from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, based on
the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common
stock by the selling stockholders.
 
The primary purpose of this offering is to fund working capital and other
general corporate purposes, including to finance research and development of
products, sales and marketing activities, opportunistic acquisitions and other
capital expenditures. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly from our expectations depending on numerous factors, including our
results of operations, financial condition and capital requirements. Management
has broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering among the
identified uses described above. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

contribute the net profits interest to the trust in exchange for all of the

expenses of approximately $12.6 million associated with this offering and will
receive all net proceeds from the offering. The net proceeds to MV Partners will
be approximately $137.4 million. MV Energy and VAP-I will each receive
$10.5 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
trust units in full. MV Partners intends to apply the net proceeds from this
offering to repay approximately $55.0 million of indebtedness of MV Partners
under its bank credit facility and to use the remaining $82.4 million to
repurchase certain equity interests in VAP-I, the owner of a 50% interest in MV
Partners, for distributions to the members of MV Partners or any combination of
the foregoing. As of September 30, 2006, MV Partners' bank credit facility bore
interest at 6.6% per annum and matures on December 19, 2008."

(1)  º Includes underwriters' deferred discount of 4% of gross proceeds

(2)  º $7.88 per unit

(3)  º Funds held in the trust account are not available to holders of private
     placement securities upon our liquidation and dissolution

    Of the net proceeds of this offering, $81,050,000 or $93,605,000 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, plus $4,000,000 from
the private placement, (accordingly, an aggregate of $85,050,000 or $97,605,000,
respectively) will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. Additionally, $3,600,000, or $4,140,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount will be deposited into such trust account. The funds held
in the trust account will be invested only in United States ""government
securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our dissolution
and liquidation. If we are required to dissolve, we anticipate we will pay the
costs of dissolution and liquidation, which we currently estimate to be
approximately $50,000 to $75,000, from our remaining assets outside of the trust
account. This amount includes all costs and expenses relating to filing our
certificate of dissolution in the State of Delaware, the winding up of our
company and the costs of a proxy statement and meeting relating to the approval
by our stockholders of our dissolution and plan for the distribution of our
assets. While we believe there should be sufficient funds available for the
proceeds not held in the trust account to fund the $50,000 to $75,000 of
expenses, David C. McCourt has agreed to pay the costs of dissolution and
liquidation in the event our remaining assets outside the trust are insufficient
to pay those costs, excluding any special, indirect or consequential costs or
expenses, such as litigation pertaining to our dissolution and liquidation.
While we will seek waivers from all target acquisitions, vendors and service
providers to claims to amounts in the trust account, we cannot guarantee that we
will be able to obtain any such waiver or that any such waiver will be held
valid and enforceable. Mr. McCourt has agreed that he will be personally liable
to cover claims made by such third parties, but only if, and to the extent, the
claims reduce the amounts in the trust account available for payment to our
stockholders in the event of a liquidation and the claims are made by a vendor
for services rendered, or products sold, to us or by a prospective target
business. However, Mr. McCourt will not have any personal liability as to any
claimed amounts owed to a third party who executed a waiver, or as to any claims
under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target acquisition with which we complete a business combination
(excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the
underwriters' discount). Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business will be used to finance our operations, which may include
the target business(es) we acquire in connection with the business combination,
to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board
of directors at that time.

    The payment to Capital of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for certain
administrative services, including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. David C. McCourt is the Chairman and CEO of Capital and, as a result,
will benefit from the transaction with Capital. However, this arrangement is
solely for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. McCourt compensation
in lieu of a salary.

    Mr. McCourt has advanced a total of $218,000 in exchange for a promissory
note from us. The promissory note is payable, without interest, upon the earlier
of (i) the consummation of the offering and (ii) July 17, 2007.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event,
the proceeds released to us from the trust account as well as any other net
proceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations, which may include
the operations of target business(es) that we acquire in the business
combination, to effect other acquisitions, for working capital, or for other
corporate purposes, as determined by our board of directors at that time.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, having a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of
these net proceeds during this period that is not otherwise returned to public
stockholders who vote against a business combination will be used to defray our
general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation
of a business combination, we will pay Capital the administrative services fee
described above. Other than this $10,000 per month fee, we will not pay any
compensation of any kind (including finders, consulting or other similar fees)
to any of our existing officers, directors or existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services that they render in order to
effectuate, or in connection with the consummation of the business combination.
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement, subject to board approval,
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target acquisitions, performing
business due diligence on suitable target acquisitions and business
combinations, as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target acquisitions to examine their operations. In
addition, Mr. McCourt may, in his sole discretion, transfer our securities held
by him to our existing officers and directors who participate in the due
diligence, structuring and negotiating of a business combination.

    We intend to use the funds not held in the trust account for due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business
combination, as well as a possible down payment, lock-up or ""no-shop"" provision,
or, if necessary, to bear the costs of dissolution and liquidation if in the
event we are unable to effect a business combination within 18 months after the
consummation of this offering (or within 24 months from the consummation of this
offering if a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement
has been executed within 18 months after the consummation of this offering and
the business combination has not yet been consummated within the 18-month
period). While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down
payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we
paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount
that would be used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision would be
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and
the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of these funds
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, potential target acquisitions. In addition to the use of funds
described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to
consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition. We believe
that the funds not held in the trust account will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses.

    We will have approximately $2,100,000 outside the trust account. Of this
amount, we estimate we will use $750,000 for legal, accounting and other
expenses attendant to the due diligence investigation, structuring and
negotiating of a business combination, $240,000 for the administrative fee
payable to Capital, $100,000 for legal and accounting fees relating to our SEC
reporting obligations and $1,010,000 for general working capital that can be
used for fairness opinions in connection with our acquisition plans, director
and officer liability insurance premiums, and other miscellaneous expenses and
reserves. We do not believe that we will need to raise additional funds
following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating
our business. However, we may need to raise additional funds through a private
offering of debt or equity securities if funds are required to consummate a
business combination that is presented to us, although we have not entered into
any such arrangements and have no current intention of doing so.

    A public stockholder (but not our existing stockholders with respect to any
shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering) will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned
on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the event of our
dissolution and liquidation or if that public stockholder (but not our existing
stockholders with respect to any shares of our common stock owned by them
immediately prior to this offering) converts such shares into cash in connection
with a business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which
we consummate. An existing stockholder who acquires shares in or after this
offering, however, would be a public stockholder with respect to these shares
and retains the right to receive funds from the trust account upon our
dissolution and liquidation and to exercise conversion rights attributable to
such shares. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust account
attributable to the underwriters' discount held in the trust account (subject to
a $0.32 per share reduction with respect to public stockholders who vote against
our initial business combination and exercise their conversion rights). In the
event that we are unable to consummate a business combination and the trustee is
forced to dissolve and liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed
that: (i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and any
accrued interest thereon; and (ii) the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public
stockholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

(1)  º Includes underwriters' deferred discount of 4% of gross proceeds

(2)  º $7.88 per unit

(3)  º Funds held in the trust account are not available to holders of private
     placement securities upon our liquidation and dissolution

    Of the net proceeds of this offering, $81,050,000 or $93,605,000 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, plus $4,000,000 from
the private placement, (accordingly, an aggregate of $85,050,000 or $97,605,000,
respectively) will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. Additionally, $3,600,000, or $4,140,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount will be deposited into such trust account. The funds held
in the trust account will be invested only in United States ""government
securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our dissolution
and liquidation. If we are required to dissolve, we anticipate we will pay the
costs of dissolution and liquidation, which we currently estimate to be
approximately $50,000 to $75,000, from our remaining assets outside of the trust
account. This amount includes all costs and expenses relating to filing our
certificate of dissolution in the State of Delaware, the winding up of our
company and the costs of a proxy statement and meeting relating to the approval
by our stockholders of our dissolution and plan for the distribution of our
assets. While we believe there should be sufficient funds available for the
proceeds not held in the trust account to fund the $50,000 to $75,000 of
expenses, David C. McCourt has agreed to pay the costs of dissolution and
liquidation in the event our remaining assets outside the trust are insufficient
to pay those costs, excluding any special, indirect or consequential costs or
expenses, such as litigation pertaining to our dissolution and liquidation.
While we will seek waivers from all target acquisitions, vendors and service
providers to claims to amounts in the trust account, we cannot guarantee that we
will be able to obtain any such waiver or that any such waiver will be held
valid and enforceable. Mr. McCourt has agreed that he will be personally liable
to cover claims made by such third parties, but only if, and to the extent, the
claims reduce the amounts in the trust account available for payment to our
stockholders in the event of a liquidation and the claims are made by a vendor
for services rendered, or products sold, to us or by a prospective target
business. However, Mr. McCourt will not have any personal liability as to any
claimed amounts owed to a third party who executed a waiver, or as to any claims
under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target acquisition with which we complete a business combination
(excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the
underwriters' discount). Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business will be used to finance our operations, which may include
the target business(es) we acquire in connection with the business combination,
to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board
of directors at that time.

    The payment to Capital of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for certain
administrative services, including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. David C. McCourt is the Chairman and CEO of Capital and, as a result,
will benefit from the transaction with Capital. However, this arrangement is
solely for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. McCourt compensation
in lieu of a salary.

    Mr. McCourt has advanced a total of $218,000 in exchange for a promissory
note from us. The promissory note is payable, without interest, upon the earlier
of (i) the consummation of the offering and (ii) July 17, 2007.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event,
the proceeds released to us from the trust account as well as any other net
proceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations, which may include
the operations of target business(es) that we acquire in the business
combination, to effect other acquisitions, for working capital, or for other
corporate purposes, as determined by our board of directors at that time.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, having a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of
these net proceeds during this period that is not otherwise returned to public
stockholders who vote against a business combination will be used to defray our
general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation
of a business combination, we will pay Capital the administrative services fee
described above. Other than this $10,000 per month fee, we will not pay any
compensation of any kind (including finders, consulting or other similar fees)
to any of our existing officers, directors or existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services that they render in order to
effectuate, or in connection with the consummation of the business combination.
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement, subject to board approval,
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target acquisitions, performing
business due diligence on suitable target acquisitions and business
combinations, as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target acquisitions to examine their operations. In
addition, Mr. McCourt may, in his sole discretion, transfer our securities held
by him to our existing officers and directors who participate in the due
diligence, structuring and negotiating of a business combination.

    We intend to use the funds not held in the trust account for due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business
combination, as well as a possible down payment, lock-up or ""no-shop"" provision,
or, if necessary, to bear the costs of dissolution and liquidation if in the
event we are unable to effect a business combination within 18 months after the
consummation of this offering (or within 24 months from the consummation of this
offering if a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement
has been executed within 18 months after the consummation of this offering and
the business combination has not yet been consummated within the 18-month
period). While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down
payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we
paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition, the amount
that would be used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision would be
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and
the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of these funds
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, potential target acquisitions. In addition to the use of funds
described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to
consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition. We believe
that the funds not held in the trust account will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses.

    We will have approximately $2,100,000 outside the trust account. Of this
amount, we estimate we will use $750,000 for legal, accounting and other
expenses attendant to the due diligence investigation, structuring and
negotiating of a business combination, $240,000 for the administrative fee
payable to Capital, $100,000 for legal and accounting fees relating to our SEC
reporting obligations and $1,010,000 for general working capital that can be
used for fairness opinions in connection with our acquisition plans, director
and officer liability insurance premiums, and other miscellaneous expenses and
reserves. We do not believe that we will need to raise additional funds
following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating
our business. However, we may need to raise additional funds through a private
offering of debt or equity securities if funds are required to consummate a
business combination that is presented to us, although we have not entered into
any such arrangements and have no current intention of doing so.

    A public stockholder (but not our existing stockholders with respect to any
shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering) will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned
on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the event of our
dissolution and liquidation or if that public stockholder (but not our existing
stockholders with respect to any shares of our common stock owned by them
immediately prior to this offering) converts such shares into cash in connection
with a business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which
we consummate. An existing stockholder who acquires shares in or after this
offering, however, would be a public stockholder with respect to these shares
and retains the right to receive funds from the trust account upon our
dissolution and liquidation and to exercise conversion rights attributable to
such shares. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust account
attributable to the underwriters' discount held in the trust account (subject to
a $0.32 per share reduction with respect to public stockholders who vote against
our initial business combination and exercise their conversion rights). In the
event that we are unable to consummate a business combination and the trustee is
forced to dissolve and liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed
that: (i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and any
accrued interest thereon; and (ii) the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public
stockholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

units offered by this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts. This amount assumes no exercise of the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional units.

    We anticipate using the proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, of this
offering to:

    •  repay approximately $104.25 million of indebtedness under our credit        
       facility; and

    We will use any net proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ option
to purchase additional units to repay any remaining indebtedness under our
credit facility and for general partnership purposes.

    As of December 15, 2006, we had $115.8 million outstanding under our credit
facility. We used the borrowings under the credit facility to:

    •  fund $65.3 million of the purchase price of producing properties from MBN   
       Properties LP in connection with the closing of our private equity offering;
   
    •  fund $13.4 million of the purchase price of producing properties and related
       operating rights in the South Justis Field;                                 
   
    •  fund the $5.6 million purchase price of operated leases in the Farmer Field;
   
    •  fund the $17.2 million purchase price of producing properties acquired from 
       Kinder Morgan;                                                              
   
    •  pay $4.0 million of derivative premiums to cancel and reset oil swaps; and  
   
    •  for general partnership purposes.                                           

    As of September 30, 2006, our credit facility bore interest at 7.21%. The
credit facility matures on March 15, 2010."

(1) At the closing of this offering, we will transfer an additional estimated    
    amount of $706,160 ($717,608 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is   
    exercised in full) into the trust account such that a total of $27,192,000   
    ($31,270,800 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in      
    full), or $8.24 per Class B share will be included in the trust account. This
    additional estimated transfer will be made from our available cash which     
    originated from the private placement of 90,450 Series A Units (at $8.00 per 
    unit) and 750,000 shares of common stock (at $0.03 per share) to our         
    management and principal stockholder in February 2006.                       

$27,192,000, or $31,270,800 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund at Wachovia
Securities, LLC and JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not
be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may
be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business or to effect other business combinations, as
determined by our board of directors at that time.

The payment to several of our officers and directors and/or their affiliated
companies of aggregate fees of $7,500 per month for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities, and secretarial support in Shanghai,
China and Atlanta, Georgia.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

We will have limited working capital upon the closing of this offering. However,
we will be entitled to 50% of the interest earned on the trust fund (prior to
the payment of any federal or state taxes due by the company) up to a maximum 
of $1,200,000, and we intend to use this working capital for director and 
officer liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve for 
due diligence, legal, accounting, and other expenses of structuring and 
negotiating business combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below.

We have also received a proposed commitment for a $250,000 line of credit from
Wachovia Bank, of which we anticipate using approximately $70,000 to pay
offering expenses not paid from the proceeds of this offering and the remainder
would be used to finance our general working capital needs, but which does not
include any expenses associated with a dissolution and liquidation or any
amounts that may be due to or reserved for payment to creditors. In accordance
with the terms of the proposed commitment, the line of credit will mature in 24
months, from the closing of this offering and will bear interest at LIBOR plus
2% with interest payable monthly and the outstanding principal and interest due
and payable at maturity. In accordance with the proposed commitment, the bank
will authorize all distributions to us to the extent that the aggregate sum of
interest distributed to us from the trust fund exceeds $900,000. Wachovia Bank
has not agreed to waive any claims it may have against the trust account in
connection with the line of credit. However, Wachovia Bank is substantially
protected as to repayment in that it controls our ability to utilize the final
$300,000 in interest that would be payable to us from the trust account.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be either held in cash or
invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180
days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. One half of the interest
income derived from investment of these net proceeds (prior to the payment of
any federal or state taxes due by the company) up to a maximum of $1,200,000
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds, including the funds to be received from our portion of the
interest on the trust fund, to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time. This belief is
based on management’s estimate of the expenses that we expect to incur, our
research of the interest earnings we project to receive, and the resulting
revenue and expense projections.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the completion of
the business combination with a target business, we will pay the administrative
fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid
to any of our existing common stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of the
business combination. However, our existing common stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
attending management or board meetings, and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations.

Because the role of present directors and management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

A Class B stockholder will be entitled to receive from the trust fund $8.24 per
Class B share, plus the pro-rata share of the interest earned on the trust fund
in excess of the lesser of $1,200,000 or 50% of such interest (prior to the
payment of any federal or state taxes due by the company) only in the event of
our liquidation or if that Class B stockholder were to seek to convert their
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the Class B
stockholder voted against and which we actually complete.

If we are unable to complete a business combination, we expect that the costs
associated with the implementation and completion of a plan of dissolution and
distribution will be approximately $125,000 and will be funded by any funds not 
held in the trust account although we cannot assure you that there will be 
sufficient funds for such purpose. If these assets are not sufficient, we will 
pay the costs from the interest earned on the trust account after taxes that is 
not distributed to us for operations, which will reduce the amounts available to
our Class B and common stockholders.

However, in connection with a liquidation, we cannot predict with certainty:
(a) the potential claims or lawsuits that may be brought against us; (b) what
waiver agreements, if any, we will obtain from vendors, service providers and
prospective target businesses; (c) the amount of additional expenses that we may
incur that exceeds the amount of funds held outside of the trust; and (d) our
ability to ensure that the proceeds held in trust are not reduced by claims of
target businesses or vendors. As such, it is possible that foregoing claims
could result in a reduction of the principal in the trust account, which would
reduce the amounts payable to our Class B stockholders in a liquidation below
$8.24 per share. In the event of a liquidation, our officers, directors, and
initial stockholder have agreed to indemnify us from any third party claims
against us that would reduce the amount of funds held in trust, on a several
basis, in proportion to their ownership interest in our Series A Units prior to
this offering."

Class B share, plus the pro-rata share of the interest earned on the trust fund
in excess of the lesser of $1,200,000 or 50% of such interest (prior to the
payment of any federal or state taxes due by the company) only in the event of
our liquidation or if that Class B stockholder were to seek to convert their
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the Class B
stockholder voted against and which we actually complete.

If we are unable to complete a business combination, we expect that the costs
associated with the implementation and completion of a plan of dissolution and
distribution will be approximately $125,000 and will be funded by any funds not 
held in the trust account although we cannot assure you that there will be 
sufficient funds for such purpose. If these assets are not sufficient, we will 
pay the costs from the interest earned on the trust account after taxes that is 
not distributed to us for operations, which will reduce the amounts available to
our Class B and common stockholders.

However, in connection with a liquidation, we cannot predict with certainty:
(a) the potential claims or lawsuits that may be brought against us; (b) what
waiver agreements, if any, we will obtain from vendors, service providers and
prospective target businesses; (c) the amount of additional expenses that we may
incur that exceeds the amount of funds held outside of the trust; and (d) our
ability to ensure that the proceeds held in trust are not reduced by claims of
target businesses or vendors. As such, it is possible that foregoing claims
could result in a reduction of the principal in the trust account, which would
reduce the amounts payable to our Class B stockholders in a liquidation below
$8.24 per share. In the event of a liquidation, our officers, directors, and
initial stockholder have agreed to indemnify us from any third party claims
against us that would reduce the amount of funds held in trust, on a several
basis, in proportion to their ownership interest in our Series A Units prior to
this offering."

support our  anticipated  future growth.  The actual net proceeds will depend on
the expenses incurred by us in connection with the offering and the total number
of shares of stock  issued in the  offering,  which  depends on the  independent
valuation and market  considerations.  Although the actual net proceeds from the
sale of the common stock cannot be  determined  until the offering is completed,
we  estimate  that net  proceeds  from the sale of common  stock will be between
$15.5 million and $21.2 million,  or $24.5 million at the adjusted maximum.  The
net proceeds may vary significantly because total expenses of the stock offering
may be significantly more or less than those estimated. Payments for shares made
through  withdrawals from existing  deposit accounts at Millington  Savings Bank
will not result in the receipt of new funds for  investment but will result in a
reduction of Millington  Savings Bank's  deposits and interest  expense as funds
are transferred from interest- bearing certificates or other deposit accounts.

         Millington  Savings Bank will receive 50% of the net proceeds  from the
offering  as a capital  contribution  and will use those  proceeds  for  general
business purposes. In particular, the Bank intends to reduce its borrowings. The
Bank has had strong loan  originations in recent years and has used Federal Home
Loan Bank borrowings to supplement  deposits as a funding source for its lending
activities.  Between June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2006,  total loans grew by $99.7
million  to  $224.4  million,  an 80%  increase,  while  deposits  grew by $40.8
million,  a 26.5%  increase and borrowings  grew from $0 to $54.2  million.  The
majority of borrowings at June 30, 2006 were short term borrowings, which may be
reduced without incurring prepayment penalties.

         The  offering  proceeds  may  also  be  used to  finance  the  possible
acquisition  of  other  financial   institutions  or  branches,  if  appropriate
opportunities  arise.  We do not,  however,  have  any  current understandings,  
agreements  or  arrangements  in connection  with  branching or acquisitions,   
other  than  the  already  in  progress  new  branch  office  in Bernardsville,  
New Jersey  which is expected to open in late 2007.  We estimate that the total 
land,  construction  and equipment  costs incurred in opening the Bernardsville 
office will reach approximately $5.4 million.

         We will lend a  portion  of the  offering  proceeds  to the  Millington
Savings Bank Employee  Stock  Ownership Plan to enable it to buy up to 8% of the
shares sold in the offering.  If it does not buy the full amount of its intended
common stock purchase in the offering, it may purchase shares of common stock in
the open market after the stock  offering.  If the purchase  price of the common
stock is higher  than $10 per share,  the amount of  proceeds  required  for the
purchase by the  Millington  Savings Bank  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan will
increase.

         The balance of the offering  proceeds will be retained by MSB Financial
Corp. and deposited with or loaned to Millington  Savings Bank,  providing funds
to support the Bank's  lending  activities.  This will enable the Bank to reduce
its outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.  MSB Financial Corp. may also
use the offering proceeds it retains for general corporate  purposes,  including
repurchasing  shares of its common  stock,  paying cash  dividends or supporting
acquisitions of other  financial  institutions,  branches or financial  services
companies."

this offering will be approximately $22.6 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $7.00 per share, and after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $26.3 million.

We estimate that we will use the proceeds of this offering (assuming no exercise
of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) as follows:

† approximately $17.0 million to fund product research and development activities,
including:

† approximately $1.5 million to fund the continued development of our prostate
cancer diagnostic product, which we expect will fund development through the
initiation of clinical validation of the product;

† approximately $1.5 million to fund the continued development of our lung cancer
diagnostic product, which we expect will fund development through the initiation
of clinical validation of the product;

† approximately $3.0 million to fund the continued development of our colorectal
cancer diagnostic product, which we expect will fund development through
clinical validation of the product;

† approximately $3.0 million to fund the continued development or our breast
cancer diagnostic product, which we expect will fund development through
clinical validation of the product;

† approximately $4.0 million to fund the continued development of our CUP
diagnostic product, which we expect will fund development through clinical
validation of the product; and

† approximately $4.0 million to fund the continued development of our liver cancer
therapeutic product, which we expect will fund development through the
initiation of preclinical studies;

† approximately $2.5 million to fund licensing and protection of intellectual
property rights, including payment of fees associated with the in-licensing of
intellectual property and fees associated with the continued prosecution of
existing patent applications and the filing and prosecution of new patent
applications; and

† approximately $3.1 million to fund business development, including personnel
costs and legal and other administrative fees related to seeking and entering
into strategic business collaborations, and for general corporate purposes,
including working capital.

The first step in the development of our cancer diagnostic product candidates is
to identify a subset of microRNAs that are found in different quantities, or are
differentially expressed, between two distinct groups of biological samples by
measuring the amount of known microRNAs in each of the sample groups. For
instance, by measuring the amount of known microRNAs, which is known as the
microRNA expression profile, in samples from patients suffering from a certain
type of cancer and comparing them to the expression profile of samples from
healthy people, we attempt to identify a subset of microRNAs that are
differentially expressed between these two groups. This subset of differentially
expressed microRNAs is known as a biomarker panel, which we believe can be used
to diagnose that type of cancer. We are also developing biomarker panels with
respect to specific disease parameters, such as tumor aggressiveness or rate of
recurrence, within a certain cancer, by measuring and comparing the microRNA
expression profiles of samples from patients who experienced the disease with a
particular parameter with samples from patients who did not.

The term “clinical validation” as used above with respect to our cancer
diagnostic product candidates refers to the process, after we have identified a
microRNA biomarker panel for a particular cancer or disease parameter, pursuant
to which we attempt to validate the identified biomarker panel by performing
blinded tests on samples we receive from third parties, such as medical
institutions. For example, we are developing a diagnostic product for cancer
which has spread, or metastasized, from an unknown primary site, or origin.
Diagnosis of the primary site in patients with metastatic cancer with an unknown
origin, which is also known as CUP, is important because the prognosis and
therapeutic regimens of such patients are dependent on the origin of the primary
tumor. After identifying potential biomarker panels that we believe will
identify the origin of metastatic cancers, we will attempt to clinically
validate these biomarker panels. In doing so, we will obtain samples of
metastatic cancers with known origins from medical institutions but the origins
of the primary tumor will not be identified to us. We will then determine what 
we believe to be the origins of the cancers using our identified microRNA 
biomarker panels and send our findings to the medical institutions for
verification.

After clinical validation, we intend to pursue two routes to commercialization
of the clinically validated diagnostic product. First, we intend to market the
validated test through reference clinical laboratories who would market
diagnostic testing services directly to customers. Such testing services are not
currently regulated by the FDA. In addition, we would also continue to seek
market approval by the FDA of the diagnostic product as a medical device. Based
on discussions that we would have with the FDA, this approval would take the
form of either a 510(k) pre-market notification or through the pre-market
approval, or PMA, process. All of our diagnostic product programs are
currently in the early stages of development. There can be no assurance that we
will ever be successful in clinically validating, receiving FDA approval for or
commercializing a diagnostic product based on microRNAs.

We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the potential acquisition of, or
investment in, technologies, products or companies that complement our business,
although we have no current understandings, commitments or agreements to do so.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the
particular uses for the proceeds from this offering, or the amounts that we will
actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the progress of our
research, development and commercialization efforts, the progress of our
clinical trials, our ability to enter into strategic collaborations and our
operating costs and expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering.

The costs and timing of the development of diagnostic and therapeutic products,
particularly conducting required clinical trials and obtaining regulatory
approval, are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial risks, and can often
change. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the funds that we have allocated
as set forth above will enable us to develop the respective products to the
stages that we expect. In addition, we may change the allocation of use of these
proceeds as a result of contingencies such as the progress and results of our
research and development activities, required clinical trials, the establishment
of collaborations, the results of our commercialization efforts, our
manufacturing requirements and regulatory or competitive developments.

We will require substantial additional funds to complete the research and
development and clinical and regulatory activities necessary to bring our
product candidates to market. We believe that the net proceeds from this
offering, our existing cash and cash equivalents, and funding we expect to
receive under our current collaboration and license agreements will be
sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 18 months. However, our
funding requirements may change and will depend upon numerous factors, many of
which are currently unknown to us, and we may need additional funds sooner than
planned. We cannot assure you that additional funds will be available when we
need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.

Pending their ultimate use, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering primarily in investment grade, interest-bearing instruments."

be used by each Fund, through its corresponding Master Fund, to engage in the
trading of exchange-traded futures on its corresponding Index with a view to
tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of
the corresponding Index over time, less the expenses of the operations of the
Fund and its corresponding Master Fund. Each Master Fund’s portfolio also will
hold United States Treasury securities and other high credit quality short-term
fixed income securities for deposit with such Master Fund’s Commodity Broker as
margin.

To the extent that a Master Fund trades in futures contracts on United States
exchanges, the assets deposited by such Master Fund with its Commodity Broker as
margin must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such
segregated funds may be invested only in a limited range of
instruments—principally U.S. government obligations.

To the extent, if any, that a Master Fund trades in futures on markets other
than regulated United States futures exchanges, funds deposited to margin
positions held on such exchanges are invested in bank deposits or in instruments
of a credit standing generally comparable to those authorized by the CFTC for
investment of “customer segregated funds,” although applicable CFTC rules
prohibit funds employed in trading on foreign exchanges from being deposited in
“customer segregated fund accounts.”

Although the percentages set forth below may vary substantially over time, as of
the date of this Prospectus, each Master Fund estimates:

(i) up to approximately 10% of the net asset value of the Master Fund will be
placed in segregated accounts in the name of such Master Fund with the Commodity
Broker (or another eligible financial institution, as applicable) in the form of
cash or United States Treasury bills to margin positions of all commodities
combined. Such funds will be segregated pursuant to CFTC rules;

(ii) approximately 90% of the net asset value of the Master Fund will be
maintained in segregated accounts in the name of such Master Fund in bank
deposits or United States Treasury and United States Government Agencies issues.

It is expected that a Master Fund will commit 10% or less of net assets to
margin its futures positions in the DX Contracts.

The Managing Owner, a registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading
advisor, will be responsible for the cash management activities of each Master
Fund, including investing in United States Treasury and United States Government
Agencies issues.

In addition, assets of each Master Fund not required to margin positions may be
maintained in United States bank accounts opened in the name of such Master Fund
and may be held in United States Treasury bills (or other securities approved by
the CFTC for investment of customer funds).

We plan to use $141.2 million of the net proceeds of this offering to fund a

sale of        shares of common stock at the initial public offering price of

million and estimated offering expenses of $4.3 million. If the underwriters
exercise their overallotment option in full, then the estimated net proceeds
will be approximately $47.0 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the
sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets.

We intend to repay all amounts owed under our term loan and working capital line
of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. As of December 31, 2006, we had
approximately $4.3 million outstanding under the term loan and working capital
line of credit. Our term loan matures September 2009 and bears interest at a
floating annual rate of 1% plus the prime rate and the revolving portion of our
credit facility matures August 9, 2008 and bears interest at a floating annual
rate of 0.25% plus the prime rate. We entered into the loan agreement with
Silicon Valley Bank in August 2006 in order to provide additional working
capital for our business and to discharge our existing indebtedness under our
revolving line of credit with Kent Plunkett, our Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer.

We intend to use the remainder of our net proceeds to finance our working
capital needs and for general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of
our net proceeds to acquire new data to supplement and expand our existing data
sets as well as to acquire complementary products, technologies or businesses.
Although we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any
acquisitions or other such transactions and have not allocated funds for any
such transactions in our business plan, we believe that the proceeds from this
offering will enable us to more effectively pursue strategic opportunities, such
as the acquisitions and other transactions discussed above, when and as we
identify them.

The amounts described above reflect our estimate of the use of our net proceeds
from this offering, based on our current plans. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including cash flows from
operations and the anticipated growth of our business. If our operating cash
flows are lower than we expect, we may need to fund operating expenses and
capital expenditures with the proceeds of this offering. Management will have
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering. Pending
any use, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-term, 
interest-bearing investment-grade securities."

offering to fund future capital expenditures and approximately $25 million for
the expansion of our efforts associated with the research and development of new
products and the enhancement of existing products including sales and marketing
efforts associated with these products. In addition, we intend to use a portion
of the net proceeds of this offering to repay short-term loans outstanding with
The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ bank which approximated $50.4 million as of
December 31, 2006. Interest on these loans is paid monthly at the TIBOR rate
plus a premium which ranged in total from 0.56% to 0.89% during the nine month
period ended December 31, 2006. We intend to use the remainder of the net
proceeds, if any, from this offering for working capital and general corporate
purposes. While we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to
enter into any potential acquisitions, we may also use a portion of the net
proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, businesses, technologies or
products that complement our existing business. The timing and amounts actually
spent for each and any of these purposes may vary significantly and will depend
on a number of factors, including our revenues and operating costs, working
capital and capital expenditures and other factors described under “Risk
Factors.” Accordingly, management will retain broad discretion as to the
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering.
 
Pending any use, as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in a
variety of investment-grade, short-term and interest-bearing securities.

(1)  Approximately $127,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC
     registration fee, the NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the
     American Stock Exchange filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit
     fees, have been or will be paid from funds we received from Danbury
     Management Company, LLC and members of our management team. These funds
     will be repaid without interest from the proceeds of this offering
     available to us.

(2)  For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are reflected as
     the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of the offering.
     An additional $1,800,000, or $2,070,000 if the over-allotment option is
     exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in trust following the
     consummation of the offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and
     when we consummate a business combination.

(3)  The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain
     constant at $50,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition,
     $1,600,000 of interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust
     account will be available to us to pay for our working capital
     requirements. For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us
     is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately
     following the offering.

    In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, certain of our
initial stockholders have agreed to purchase 2,923,077 of the private placement
warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $1,900,000 in cash, which amount
will be paid by our initial stockholders and deposited in the trust account. The
investment from each initial stockholder participating in the private placement
constitutes ""at risk"" capital from each stockholder for his or its own account.
These purchases will take place on a private placement basis occurring
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will not pay any
discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase or sale of the private
placement warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from the private placement
will be placed in the trust fund described below.

    $56,900,000, or $65,540,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full, of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,900,000 we will receive from
the sale of the private placement warrants, will be placed in a trust account at
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, as trustee. This amount includes $1,800,000 of underwriting discounts
and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering (or $2,070,000 if
the underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full). The underwriters
have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The funds
held in trust will be invested only in United States ""government securities""
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we
are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
Except with respect to interest income that may be released to us of (i) up to
$1,600,000 to fund expenses related to investigating and selecting a target
business and our other working capital requirements and (ii) any additional
amounts we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds
held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. In addition to
funding the acquisition of a target business, we may use a portion of the funds
released from the trust account to pay expenses related to the business
combination, including professional fees, finder's fees, and vendor and service
provider costs, as well as operating expenses. A portion of the funds released
from the trust account may also be used to provide working capital to, or to pay
indebtedness or other liabilities of, the target business.

    The payment to NEGF Advisory Company Inc. an affiliate of two of our initial
stockholders, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. This
arrangement is being agreed to by NEGF Advisory Company Inc. for our benefit and
is not intended to provide our initial stockholders compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the Boston,
Massachusetts metropolitan area, that the fee charged by NEGF Advisory
Company Inc. is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a
business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder's, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination. However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us
out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to ""Legal, accounting
and other expenses attendant to the due diligence investigation, structuring and
negotiation of a business combination,"" ""Identification of a prospective target
business"" and ""Working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance
and reserves."" Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

    Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the
net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for
a business combination will be approximately $50,000. In addition, interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $1,600,000, will be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements when and if such funds
are needed. These funds will be used by us for director and officer liability
insurance premiums, due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations, as well as for reimbursement
of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in
connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We will also be
entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released
to us to pay certain tax obligations that we may owe. We believe these funds
will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We
could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business or to use as a down payment or to fund a
""no-shop"" provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target
businesses from soliciting competing proposals from other companies on terms
more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If
we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down
payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision would be determined based on the terms
of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States ""government
securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business.

    To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will
pay the costs of dissolution from our remaining assets outside of the trust
account. If such funds are insufficient, our initial stockholders have agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such dissolution (currently
anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to
seek repayment of such expenses.

    Danbury Management Company, LLC and members of our management team have
advanced to us a total of $127,000 which was or will be used to pay a portion of
the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American
Stock Exchange listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and
expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the consummation of this
offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
available to us for payment of offering expenses.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder
converts such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

equals 10% of the bond amount, is not available for general operating needs.
Capitalized interest for 15 months has been reserved to service the debt during
the construction period through the start-up phase.

    The balance of this equity offering, approximately $3.5 million, will be
used for the development of additional facility sites, as well as general and
administrative costs, including salaries, accounting and legal fees, rent and
other facilities expenses, the payment of $202,000 in fees to International
Bio-Recovery Corporation (“IBRC”), the licensor of technology to be used in our
Woodbridge facility, and other working capital expenses.

    The foregoing information is an estimate based on our current business plan.
We may find it necessary or advisable to re-allocate portions of the net
proceeds reserved for one category of uses to another, and we will have broad
discretion in doing so. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds
of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing securities."

    The proceeds of the proposed New Jersey solid waste revenue bond offering
will be used to purchase equipment and complete construction and rehabilitate
certain buildings on the leased property. The debt service reserve fund, which
equals 10% of the bond amount, is not available for general operating needs.
Capitalized interest for 15 months has been reserved to service the debt during
the construction period through the start-up phase.

    The balance of this equity offering, approximately $3.5 million, will be
used for the development of additional facility sites, as well as general and
administrative costs, including salaries, accounting and legal fees, rent and
other facilities expenses, the payment of $202,000 in fees to International
Bio-Recovery Corporation (“IBRC”), the licensor of technology to be used in our
Woodbridge facility, and other working capital expenses.

    The foregoing information is an estimate based on our current business plan.
We may find it necessary or advisable to re-allocate portions of the net
proceeds reserved for one category of uses to another, and we will have broad
discretion in doing so. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds
of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing securities."

stock in this offering will be approximately $44.1 million, based upon the
initial public offering price of $7.00 per share. If the underwriters exercise
the over-allotment option in whole or in part, we will not receive any of the
proceeds from the sale of those shares by the selling stockholder.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate our future access to
the public equity markets and to provide liquidity for our existing
stockholders.

We anticipate that we will use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

        º approximately $22.0 million to fund certain of our obligations under
          our prospective buy-back agreement with Par relating to our repurchase
          of Par's rights to develop and commercialize Difimicin and related
          assets;

        º approximately $12.0 million to be used together with existing cash and
          cash equivalents to fund clinical trials and other research and
          development activities of Difimicin for the treatment of CDAD;

        º approximately $3.0 million to be used together with existing cash and
          cash equivalents to fund clinical trials and other research and
          development activities of Prulifloxacin for the treatment of
          travelers' diarrhea;

        º approximately $2.0 million to fund commercialization activities,
          including conducting pre-launch preparations and initiating marketing
          and sales activities for Difimicin and Prulifloxacin; and

        º the remainder to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other
          general corporate purposes, including at least approximately
          $1.0 million for additional costs and expenses associated with being a
          public company, which also includes the cost of compliance with
          Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal control regulations such as costs for
          hiring additional employees, consultants, counsel and accountants.

We may also use a portion of our net proceeds from this offering to fund
possible in-licenses and acquisitions of products or product candidates. To the
degree that we pursue any of these transactions, the amount of proceeds that we
have available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general
corporate purposes may decrease. However, other than our prospective buy-back
agreement with Par, we have no current agreements or commitments with respect
to, and no portion of our net proceeds has been allocated for, any specific
acquisition. Our management will have broad discretion in applying our net
proceeds of this offering and a change in our plans or business condition could
result in the application of our net proceeds from this offering in a manner
other than described in this prospectus. We believe that our net proceeds from
this offering, along with existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient
to meet our capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.

We anticipate that these proceeds together with existing cash and cash
equivalents will allow us to complete the ongoing Phase 2b/3 clinical trial and
the planned second Phase 3 trial of Difimicin for the treatment of CDAD, as well
as the two Phase 3 clinical trials of Prulifloxacin for the treatment of
travelers' diarrhea. The foregoing use of our net proceeds from this offering
represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and business
condition. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon 
numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts and 
the amount of net proceeds actually raised by us in this offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds in money market funds
and government agency securities."

offering are estimated to be approximately $71.9 million based on the initial
public offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

We presently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:
 
    †   Approximately $28.0 million will be used to repay our outstanding          
        indebtedness under two term loans for approximately $18.0 million and $10.0
        million, payable to our commercial lender. These loans bear interest at    
        LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum and LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum (except during   
        the first year in which the rate is 4.58%), respectively, and are due and  
        payable beginning June 30, 2007 and March 31, 2007, respectively. Both     
        loans have four year terms with the principal payable monthly over three   
        years. However, the loans become due and payable in full upon the closing  
        of an initial public offering. The proceeds of the loans borrowed were used
        to fund the acquisition of Partsbin, to fund the stockholder distribution  
        made in connection with the March 2006 recapitalization, and for general   
        working capital needs.                                                     

    †   Approximately $5.0 million will be used to repay our outstanding           
        indebtedness under certain promissory notes payable to the former          
        stockholders of Partsbin. The notes bear interest at LIBOR and are due and 
        payable in equal quarterly installments beginning in the quarter ending    
        June 30, 2007, with the final payment due in the quarter ending March 31,  
        2008. However, the notes become due and payable in full upon the closing of
        an initial public offering. The amounts outstanding under these promissory 
        notes were used to fund the acquisition of Partsbin.                       

    †   The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for working capital and for 
        general corporate purposes, including the introduction of new product      
        categories, the expansion of existing product categories and expansion into
        complementary businesses.                                                  

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to acquire or
invest in complementary businesses, products, websites or technologies, or to
enter into strategic marketing relationships with third parties. From time to
time, in the ordinary course of business, we expect to evaluate potential
acquisitions of these businesses, services or technologies and strategic
relationships. Currently, we do not have any understandings, commitments or
agreements with respect to any such acquisitions.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering, and the amounts we actually spend could be outside of the ranges set
forth above. The amounts actually expended for the purposes listed above will
depend upon a number of factors, including the growth of our sales and customer
base, the type of efforts we make to build our brand and competitive
developments in e-commerce. Accordingly, our management will retain broad
discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending their
use, we anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, NASD 
    filing fee, American Stock Exchange listing fee and approximately $20,000 of 
    legal and accounting fees and $10,000 of miscellaneous expenses, have been   
    paid from the loans we received from certain of our officers and directors   
    and their affiliates described below. These loans will be repaid out of the  
    proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this
    offering. Except for the SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and American  
    Stock Exchange listing fee, the amounts shown are estimates only and our     
    actual expenditures may differ from those set forth herein.                  

(2) $150,000 of legal fees related to the offering will be paid from the interest
    earned on the trust account released to us ($25,000 per month for six        
    months).                                                                     

(3) Represents 4.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering, which the

    only upon the consummation of a business combination plus interest thereon,  
    less $0.32 for each share converted to cash in connection with our business  
    combination. If a business combination is not consummated, such deferred     
    underwriting discounts and commissions and non-accountable expenses will be  
    forfeited by the underwriters.                                               

(4) The use of proceeds from the amounts not held in trust and from a portion of 
    the interest earned on the amount held in trust released to us are estimates 
    only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ      
    substantially from those set forth.                                          

$75,000,000, or $86,250,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering, including the $1,600,000 we
will receive from the private placements, will be placed in a trust account at
Morgan Stanley maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as
trustee. In addition, $3,200,000 of deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions and non-accountable expenses, or $3,680,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in the trust account
and not be paid to the underwriters unless and until we consummate a business
combination. The underwriters have waived their right to receive such payment
upon our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. Except
for a portion of the interest earned on the trust account that may be released
to us, these proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or as part of our
dissolution approved by our stockholders and our plan of distribution in
connection with our liquidation.

The net proceeds of this offering held in the trust account and moneys held by
us and not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be
invested in “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the
United States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of
1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under that act. A
portion of the interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be paid to us periodically as described in this
prospectus and used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well
as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. The
interest rate earned on the trust account will be the prevailing interest rate
on short-term U.S. treasury securities and money market funds that comply with
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These
rates will vary from time to time. As of the date of this prospectus, the yield
on such a compliant money market fund was approximately 5% per annum. Based on
such prevailing rates, we believe that the income earned on the trust account
will be sufficient to provide the contemplated amount of working capital.
However, this offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on
investments in government securities. The escrow account and the purchase of
government securities for the account is intended as a holding place for funds
pending the earlier to occur of either (i) the consummation of our primary
business objective, which is a business combination, or (ii) absent a business
combination, our dissolution and return of the funds held in this account.

The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business
combination. Interest earned on the trust account, net of taxes, will be
retained in the trust account for distribution as described below except that up
to $2,300,000 may be released to us periodically to fund our working capital
requirements. In addition, funds from the trust account will be released to
us periodically to pay income taxes on interest earned on the trust account.
Holders of common stock whose shares are converted to cash in connection with
our initial business combination will receive their pro rata portion of the
amount held in trust ($7.82 per share) plus the pro rata portion of any interest
on the portion of the trust account attributable to net proceeds of this
offering not released to us, net of taxes. In the event that we do not
consummate a business combination in a timely manner and assuming our
dissolution is approved by our stockholders in accordance with Delaware law,
public stockholders will be entitled to receive their proportionate share of the
trust account (including any interest on the net proceeds not released to us,
net of taxes, the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and the
proceeds of the private placements). In addition, such holders will be entitled
to receive a pro rata portion of our remaining assets not held in trust, less
amounts we pay, or reserve to pay, for all of our liabilities and obligations.
These liabilities and obligations include our corporate expenses arising during
our remaining existence and costs associated with our dissolution and
liquidation. Our corporate expenses are expected to be primarily associated with
preparation for and conduct of our special meeting of stockholders and our
continuing public reporting obligations, including legal services, proxy
soliciting firms, services of our independent registered public accounting firm
as well as legal fees we may incur in the event of disputes with any claimants
or creditors. While we will seek waivers from all target acquisitions, vendors
and service providers to claims to amounts in the trust account, we cannot
guarantee that we will be able to obtain any such waiver or that any such waiver
will be held valid and enforceable. Mr. Venkatadri has agreed that he will be
personally liable to cover claims made by such third parties, but only if, and
to the extent, the claims reduce the amounts in the trust account available for
payment to our stockholders in the event of a liquidation and the claims are
made by a vendor for services rendered, or products sold, to us or by a
prospective target business. However, Mr. Venkatadri will not have any personal
liability as to any claimed amounts owed to a third party who executed a waiver,
or as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of
1933. Our other directors and officers have each agreed to be personally liable,
severally, in accordance with his respective beneficial ownership interest in
us, for ensuring that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the
claims of any vendor or service provider that is owed money by us for services
rendered or products sold to us.

Other than the interest income up to $2,300,000 that may be released to us to
fund our working capital requirements and to pay income taxes on interest earned
on the trust account, the proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any
proceeds attributable to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions)
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we ultimately complete a business combination and, to the extent not used for
these purposes, released to us upon completion of a business combination. Any
amounts in the trust account not paid as consideration to the sellers of the
target business, other than amounts held in trust or paid to the representatives
of the underwriters for services as representatives of the underwriters, may be
used to pay remaining expenses of the business combination, including
reimbursement of expenses of our officers and directors incurred in connection
therewith to the extent funds not held in trust were insufficient to do so, to
pay any finders’ fees or financing fees, if any, and to finance the ongoing
operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, in each case
as determined by our board of directors at that time.

We intend to use the majority of the net proceeds of this offering not being
held in trust and the interest on the trust account released to us in our
efforts to acquire a target business, including identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, selecting the target business, and
structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination. Of these net
proceeds and the interest on the trust account released to us, we will reserve
approximately $325,000 for due diligence of prospective target businesses
payable to non-affiliates and, to the extent incurred, reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred by our officers,
directors and stockholders who assist us in connection with seeking and
selecting a target business and performing due diligence activities. None of
these persons or any of their affiliates, or our special advisor to our board of
directors, will receive any compensation for their activities in connection with
the business combination. We intend to use the working capital shown above
(approximately $375,000) together with any additional interest released to us
for other operating expenses, including director and officer liability insurance
premiums.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to make a
deposit or down payment or to fund a “no shop” provision with respect to a
particular business combination, although we do not have any current intention
to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds or
any of the funds are not returned to us (whether as a result of our breach of
the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have sufficient
remaining working capital outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence
and pay other expenses related to finding another suitable business combination
without securing additional financing. In that event and if we are unable to
secure additional working capital, we would most likely fail to consummate a
business combination in the allotted time and would be required to promptly
begin the process for our dissolution and liquidation in accordance with the
requirements of Delaware law. We may also use a portion of our excess working
capital to pay finders’ fees in connection with a business combination, although
we do not presently intend to engage finders to identify suitable transactions.
The balance, if any, of our working capital will be held in reserve in the event
that due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates. We believe that our
working capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and
reimbursement costs.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used to finance
the operations of the target business which may include subsequent acquisitions,
as determined by our board of directors at that time.

The payment to Johnson and Colmar, an affiliate of Craig Colmar, our Secretary
and Treasurer and a member of our board of directors, of a monthly fee of $7,500
is for certain administrative, technology and secretarial services, as well as
the use of certain limited office space in Chicago, Illinois. This arrangement
is being agreed to by Johnson and Colmar for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Mr. Colmar compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents
and fees for similar services in Chicago, that the fee charged by Johnson and
Colmar is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated
person. Upon completion of a business combination or our liquidation, we will no
longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

As of the date of this prospectus, certain of our officers and directors and
their affiliates have advanced to us a total of $200,000, which was used to pay
a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above
for SEC and NASD registration fees, American Stock Exchange listing fees and
other expenses. Such loans accrue 5% annual interest and are payable on the
earlier of March 1, 2007 and the consummation of this offering. The loans will
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

We reserve the right, at the discretion of the board of directors, to reallocate
our use of the net proceeds of this offering not held in trust together with any
interest on the trust account released to us, among the legal, due diligence and
working capital items in response to the timing and extent of due diligence and
legal and regulatory requirements and, in the event that we do not consummate a
business combination, to reallocate any remaining proceeds to the costs of our
liquidation and dissolution. The interest income derived from investment of
these net proceeds not held in the trust account during this period will be used
to defray our general and administrative expenses as well as costs relating to
compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated
professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Except for the monthly administrative fee payable to Johnson and Colmar, no
compensation of any kind (including any finder’s and/or consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us, prior to or in connection with, the consummation of the
business combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that
such expenses exceed the available funds not deposited in the trust account or 
released to us, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless 
we consummate a business combination. These reimbursements may be paid from the 
$325,000 initially allocated for due diligence. Other than the agreement with 
Johnson and Colmar described above, there are no current agreements or 
understandings with any of our existing stockholders or any of their respective 
affiliates with respect to the payment of compensation of any kind subsequent 
to a business combination. Since the role of present management after a business 
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if 
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of our dissolution and liquidation and failure to complete a
business combination within the allotted time, or if that public stockholder
were to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

estimated to be approximately $565.3 million, after deducting the estimated
underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us. Our net proceeds will
increase by approximately $89.4 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full.

We intend to contribute the net proceeds from this offering to the Fortress
Operating Group, which in turn will apply those proceeds as follows: (a) to pay
$250 million outstanding under our term loan facility, as required by our credit
agreement, (b) to pay approximately $85 million currently outstanding under our
revolving credit facility, (c) to fund approximately $169 million of commitments
to existing private equity funds and (d) to use $61 million for general business
purposes.

As of September 30, 2006, we had borrowed $95 million under the credit
agreement’s revolving credit facility and $600 million under our term loan
facility. As of September 30, 2006, borrowings under the credit agreement
accrued interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.00%, which was 7.57% per annum.
Upon consummation of this offering, borrowings under the credit agreement accrue
interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%. Borrowings outstanding under our
term loan facility mature on June 23, 2011. Borrowings under our credit
agreement have been used to repay prior debt of $233 million, to make a
distribution to our principals of $250 million and to increase working capital.
Amounts repaid under our credit agreement may be reborrowed from time to time,
subject to compliance with borrowing conditions. Certain of the underwriters or
their affiliates are lenders under our credit agreement and will receive their
pro rata share of amounts repaid thereunder with the net proceeds of this
offering."

stock in this offering will be approximately $16.5 million, based on the initial
public offering price of $6.50 per share and after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses which we have not
previously paid. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares
subject to the over-allotment option granted by Applied Digital to the
underwriters.

We intend to use $3.5 million of the net proceeds we receive from this offering
to repay a portion of our indebtedness to Applied Digital, in accordance with
the terms of amended loan documents between, Applied Digital, as lender, and us,
as borrower.  

We expect that approximately $8.0 million to $10.0 million of the net proceeds
of this offering will be used over the next 24 months to continue our efforts to
create a market for our VeriMed system, principally through an increase in our
sales and marketing efforts.
 
We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general
corporate purposes, which may include research and development, capital
expenditures and other sales and marketing expenses. We have not determined the
amounts to be used for any of these purposes and may find it necessary or
advisable to use this portion of the net proceeds for other purposes.

The amount and timing of what we actually spend for any of these or other
purposes will depend on a number of factors, including our future revenue and
cash generated by operations and the other factors described under “Risk
Factors.” Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in applying
this portion of the net proceeds of the offering remaining after repayment of a
portion of the amount owed to Applied Digital. Pending these uses, we intend to
invest the net proceeds that are not dedicated to repayment of our outstanding
indebtedness, and accrued interest, owed to Applied Digital in short-term
interest-bearing, investment grade securities. We cannot predict whether such
securities will yield a favorable return."

   •  pay approximately $4.0 million in expenses associated with this offering and

retired and treated as a capital contribution to us. The affiliate indebtedness

additional common units, the ownership interest of the public unitholders will
increase to 19,320,000 common units representing an aggregate 61.4% limited

In connection with the completion of this offering, NCM LLC will enter into a
new $805.0 million senior secured credit facility with a group of lenders that
will include affiliates of several of the underwriters. This facility will
consist of a six-year, $80.0 million revolving credit facility and an
eight-year, $725.0 million term loan facility. The revolving credit facility
will be available, subject to certain conditions, for general corporate purposes
of NCM LLC and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and for other

approximately $139.3 million, based on the initial public offering price of
$17.00 per share and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive
any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use approximately $104.5 million of our net proceeds from this
offering to repay a portion of the outstanding principal under our existing
credit facilities. As of September 30, 2006, approximately $144.8 million of
principal was outstanding under our existing credit facilities. We do not intend
to use any of the proceeds from this offering to repay accrued interest under
our credit facilities, which we intend to pay with working capital. On January
24, 2007, we amended our credit facilities such that we will be permitted to
repay our entire Second Lien Credit Facility and only a portion of our First
Lien Credit Facility. We pay interest on the principal of our Second Lien Credit
Facility that we will repay with the proceeds of this offering at our option at
either a base rate, equal to the greater of the agent’s prime rate of 0.50%
above the federal funds rate, plus the applicable margin or a Eurodollar rate,
based on the one-, two-, three-, or six-month Eurodollar rate, plus the
applicable margin. The Second Lien Credit Facility has a maturity date of April
13, 2011. We pay interest on the principal of our First Lien Credit Facility, a
portion of which we will repay from the proceeds of this offering, equal to, at
our option, an applicable margin for base rate interest at a spread of 2.50% to
3.25%, or an applicable margin for Eurodollar rate interest at a spread of 3.50%
to 4.25%. The First Lien Credit Facility has maturity dates of October 13, 2010
and October 13, 2011. The remaining approximately $34.8 million of net proceeds
will be used for capital expenditures, for working capital and for other general
corporate purposes. In addition, we may use a portion of the remaining net
proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services or technologies
complementary to our current business, through mergers, acquisitions, joint
ventures or otherwise. However, we have no specific agreements or commitments
and are not currently engaged in any substantive negotiations with respect to
any such transactions.

The above use of proceeds assumes that appraisal rights will not be available to
or asserted by any material number of our predecessor’s stockholders. If this
assumption is incorrect, proceeds from this offering may be used to make
appraisal payments and working capital could be materially adversely impacted.
We believe that all but one of our stockholders are bound by an investors
agreement which contains a waiver of their appraisal rights in connection with a
corporate reorganization."

US$102.0 million, or US$107.7 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

†   approximately US$20 million, which we currently anticipate to be sufficient   
    for the construction of a new GMP-certified manufacturing plant with planned  
    capacity to meet increasing market demand for our products and for            
    certification of the new plant by the European Agency for the Evaluation of   
    Medical Products, or EMEA;                                                    

†   approximately US$5 million, which we currently anticipate to be sufficient for
    improvements to our existing facilities, primarily relating to process        
    development and optimization, to achieve EMEA certification and improved      
    production yield, which involves the introduction of new production procedures
    and modifications to our existing quality control procedures, such as adding  
    virus clearance and testing procedures;                                       

†   approximately US$10 million for conducting clinical trials for our product    
    candidates, of which approximately US$3.4 million is expected to be used to   
    develop our anti-TNF humanized monoclonal antibody product candidate (SSS07), 
    US$1.7 million to develop NuPIAO, US$1.6 million to develop our HPV vaccine   
    (SSS08), US$0.7 million to develop TPIAO for the treatment of ITP, US$0.4     
    million to develop high dosage EPIAO, US$0.4 million to develop NuLeusin, and 
    approximately US$1.5 million for clinical trials necessary for the EMEA       
    registration of EPIAO. With the exception of SSS08 and SSS07, we expect that the
    proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to bring these product         
    candidates to market. In addition, we expect the portion of proceeds allocated
    to SSS07 and SSS08 to be sufficient to fund their research and development    
    costs through phase III of clinical trials. The aggregate additional expenses 
    in relation to the development of these two product candidates, currently     
    estimated to be approximately US$3.0 million to US$5.0 million, are expected  
    to be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional placements of
    our securities in the future; and                                             

†   approximately US$10 million for the expansion and enhancement of our sales and
    marketing network, including the addition of personnel to our oncology-focused
    marketing team, further penetration in our existing geographical markets and  
    expansion into new target areas in China.                                     

The remainder of the proceeds will be used for in-licensing products, working
capital and general corporate purposes.

Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in applying the net
proceeds of this offering. Until we apply the net proceeds of this offering to
the above purposes, we intend to invest them in short-term, interest bearing,
investment-grade obligations. These investments may have a material adverse
effect on the US federal income tax consequences of your investment in our ADSs.
In particular, it is possible that we may become a passive foreign investment
company for United States federal income tax purposes, which could result in
negative tax consequences for you."

from this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, the net proceeds we will receive will be approximately
US$238.0 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes:

    •   US$100 million to prepay for raw materials pursuant to our long-term wafer 
        supply agreement with M.SETEK;                                             

    •   approximately US$20 million to prepay for raw materials from other         
        suppliers, including Jinglong Group;                                       

    •   approximately US$20 million to purchase manufacturing equipment and        
        construct certain operating facilities for our planned Shanghai facilities 
        to expand our manufacturing capacity;                                      

    •   approximately US$19 million to repay our short-term debt obligations;

    •   approximately US$10 million to enhance our research and development        
        capabilities; and                                                          

    •   the remaining amount to be used for working capital and other general      
        corporate purposes.                                                        

We intend to use US$100 million of the net proceeds of this offering to prepay
for raw materials pursuant to our long-term wafer supply agreement with M.SETEK.
We have been advised by M.SETEK that it will use our prepayment to satisfy a 
portion of its capital expenditure requirements in connection with the expansion 
of its polysilicon and wafer production capacity in Japan. To the extent M.SETEK 
is unable to source additional funding to meet the balance of its capital 
expenditure requirements or is otherwise unable to expand its capacity as 
planned, its ability to satisfy its delivery requirements with us may be 
materially and adversely affected, which may in turn have a material and 
adverse effect on our ability to secure wafer supply. Although we believe 
M.SETEK is not a related party, our chairman, Baofang Jin, also is an indirect 
shareholder and the general manager of Ningjin Songgong Semiconductor Co., 
Ltd., or Ningjin Songgong, a joint venture of M.SETEK in China.

The following table sets forth a summary of our outstanding short-term debt
obligations that we intend to repay using part of the net proceeds we will
receive from this offering. The proceeds of these loans have been, and will be,
prior to the completion of this offering, used primarily for purchase of or
prepayment for raw materials.

To utilize the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we are
permitted, under PRC regulations, to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries
only through loans or capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction of
applicable government registrations and approval requirements, we may extend
inter-company loans or make additional capital contributions to our PRC
subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds. The occurrence of unforeseen events or
changed business conditions could result in application of the net proceeds of
this offering in a manner other than as described above.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
interest bearing, investment-grade debt instruments or bank deposits."

      ($291,000).                                                                 

(4)   Represents 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 9,700,000 units in 
      this offering ($1,940,000) and 4% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the
      1,455,000 units subject to the underwriters’ overallotment option ($582,000,
      assuming that the underwriters exercise the overallotment option in full)   
      that the underwriters will deposit into the Trust Account at the completion 
      of this offering and that the underwriters have agreed to forfeit in the    
      event we do not complete a business combination. These amounts will be paid 
      to the underwriters only upon completion of a business combination and then 
      only with respect to those units as to which the component shares have not  
      been redeemed. We describe these redemption rights in “Proposed             
      Business—Effecting a Business Combination—Redemption rights.” If we do not  
      complete a business combination and the Trust Account is liquidated, these  
      amounts will be distributed among our public stockholders.                  

(5)   We expect to apply the funds not held in trust towards our initial working  
      capital expenses. The payment of these expenses will be supplemented by the 
      $2,500,000 of interest earned on the Trust Account that we may withdraw, as 
      discussed below.                                                            

(6)   Excludes $1,940,000 (up to $2,522,000 if the overallotment option is        
      exercised in full) which the underwriters have agreed to deposit into the   
      Trust Account and forfeit in the event we do not complete a business        
      combination.                                                                

(7)   Excludes $3,000,000 ($3,291,000 if the overallotment option is exercised in 
      full) provided in the form of our Sponsor’s letter of credit which may be   
      drawn upon by the trustee of the Trust Account to provide a pro rata payment
      to public stockholders if we do not complete a business combination.        

$97,000,000 ($111,550,000 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised
in full), or $10.00 per unit, consisting of the proceeds from this offering, the
proceeds from the private placement, and our Sponsor’s letter of credit for
$3,000,000 ($3,291,000 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in
full) will be available to repay public stockholders if we do not complete a
business combination. The cash portion of these amounts will be placed in the
Trust Account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas maintained by American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company and the amount of our Sponsor’s letter of credit
will, to the extent required, be drawable by American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company for the benefit of the public stockholders, in each case pursuant to an
agreement to be signed on the date of this prospectus. Of this amount, up to
$92,060,000 ($105,737,000 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised
in full) may be used by us for the purpose of effecting a business combination,
up to $1,940,000 ($2,522,000 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is
exercised in full) will be paid to Merrill Lynch and Maxim Group if we complete
a business combination, but will be forfeited by Merrill Lynch and Maxim Group
if we do not complete a business combination. These funds will not be released
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidation
of the Trust Account as part of our plan of dissolution and liquidation approved
by our stockholders; provided, however, that an aggregate of up to $2,500,000 of
the interest earned on the Trust Account will be released to us for our working
capital to enable us to fund our expenses, including reimbursement of our
Sponsor for letter of credit fees, and we will be permitted to draw amounts
necessary to pay taxes on earned interest.

Except for use of up to $2,500,000 of interest for working capital (including
reimbursement to our Sponsor of letter of credit fees), the funds held in the
Trust Account will not be available for our use for any expenses related to this
offering or expenses which we may incur related to the investigation and
selection of a target business and the negotiation of an agreement to acquire a
target business, unless and until we complete a business combination. However, 
the trust agreement governing the Trust Account provides that, in the event that
our board of directors approves a plan of dissolution and liquidation and, at 
that time, we have insufficient remaining funds outside of the Trust Account to 
pay for our dissolution and liquidation expenses, we may withdraw up to 
$100,000 from interest earned on funds in the Trust Account to pay for such 
expenses.

The $1,940,000 ($2,522,000 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is
exercised in full) of Trust Account funds attributable to Merrill Lynch and
Maxim Group’s deferred underwriting (and accrued interest thereon, net of taxes
payable) will be released to Merrill Lynch and Maxim Group, respectively, and
any stockholders exercising their redemption rights, upon completion of a
business combination on the terms described in this prospectus, or to our public
stockholders upon our liquidation, but will in no event be available for use by
us in a business combination. The expenses that we may incur before we complete
a business combination may only be paid from the net proceeds of this offering
and the private placement not held in the Trust Account and any interest earned
and released to us as discussed above. There will be no fees, reimbursements or
cash payments to our existing stockholders and/or officers and directors other
than:

      †   Repayment of a $300,000 loan with no interest made by our Sponsor for    
          payment of a portion of our offering expenses;                           

      †   Reimbursement of fees payable by our Sponsor with respect to the creation
          and maintenance of the letter of credit; and                             

      †   Reimbursement for any expenses incident to the offering and finding a    
          suitable business combination.                                           

None of the public warrants, private warrants or incentive warrants may be
exercised until after we complete a business combination and, thus, after the
proceeds of the Trust Account have been disbursed. Accordingly, the warrant
exercise price will be paid directly to us and not placed in the Trust Account.

We estimate that costs related to the identification and evaluation of a target
business will be approximately $2,500,000. We expect that the component amounts
of this $2,500,000 will be made up of: approximately $720,000 to identify and
research prospective target businesses and approximately $650,000 for costs
related to the business combination, including legal and accounting expenses to
structure the transaction, prepare the transaction documents and file the
related proxy statement. This amount includes a currently estimated $50,000 to
$75,000 which may be reasonably reserved or used by us to account for our
dissolution obligations (including the costs associated with obtaining
stockholder approval of our plan of dissolution and liquidation). In addition,
we anticipate paying $180,000 for administrative services and support payable to
an affiliated third party ($7,500 per month for up to 24 months), $100,000 of
legal and accounting fees relating to our SEC reporting obligations and $850,000
for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and
reserves (including director and officer liability insurance premiums). We
intend to fund these working capital and expense amounts, as well as amounts
that may exceed our current estimates, from interest earned on funds in the
Trust Account. Potential investors are cautioned, however, that these estimates
may prove inaccurate, in which case our ability to effect a business combination
would be impaired and we may be forced to dissolve and liquidate.

We have agreed with the underwriters that we may withdraw interest earned on the
Trust Account (net of taxes payable) in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000 in
the aggregate, and that we can withdraw interest monthly (or weekly during the
first month after the offering), in order to fund our working capital needs and
expenses. Although we do not know the rate of interest to be earned on the Trust
Account, we believe that even at an interest rate of 3% per annum, the interest
available to us on the Trust Account (less interest on the underwriters’
$1,940,000 ($2,522,000 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in
full) deferred underwriting compensation, which is payable to the underwriters
if we complete a business combination) will be sufficient to fund our working
capital requirements even if they exceed our estimates. While we expect that due
diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of
our officers and directors, we may also engage market research firms and/or
third party consultants.

We may use a portion of the working capital amounts derived from the interest
earned on the Trust Account to make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop”
provision with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although
we do not have any current intention of doing so. Depending upon the amount of
the deposit or payment and the amount of additional expenses we incur relating
to the proposed business combination, if we ultimately were required to forfeit
the deposit or payment, we could be left with insufficient funds to continue
searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential target
businesses. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we would
most likely fail to consummate a business combination within the time required
in this prospectus and would be forced to implement a plan of dissolution and
liquidation. While it is possible that one or more of our existing stockholders
could advance us the additional required funds, thereby increasing the amount of
excess out-of-pocket expenses that might be reimbursed following a business
combination, they are not required to do so and do not, as of the date of this
prospectus, intend to do so.

The proceeds held in the Trust Account (exclusive of any funds used to pay
stockholders who have exercised their redemption right, interest payments as
described above and the underwriters’ deferred compensation and any interest
earned thereon) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business (other than
amounts paid for finders’ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or
costs incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made in
connection with the business combination) may be used to finance operations of
the target business, which may include subsequent acquisitions. Except as set
forth above, the principal held in trust will not be released from the Trust
Account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation.

No compensation of any kind, including finders’ and consulting fees, will be
paid to any of our directors, officers, existing stockholders or any of their
affiliates, other than the payment in connection with the general and
administrative services arrangement, described above, for services rendered to
us before or in connection with the initial business combination. However, our
officers and directors will be entitled to receive reimbursements for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them for activities on our behalf,
including activities relating to a business combination. There is no limit on
the amount of these out-of-pocket expenses, and there will be no review of the
reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board of directors,
which includes persons who may seek reimbursement. To the extent that
out-of-pocket expenses exceed the $2,500,000 of Trust Account interest we may
draw upon for working capital and the $40,000 of offering proceeds we will
retain as working capital, they will not be reimbursed by us unless we complete
a business combination. Since the role of our officers and directors after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination."

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received
      in the form of a loan from Union Street Capital Management, LLC as described
      below. This loan will be repaid out of the gross proceeds of this offering. 

(2)   Includes deferred underwriting discounts and commissions equal to 3.7% of   
      the gross proceeds from the sale of the units to the public stockholders, or
      $3,700,000 ($4,255,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is        
      exercised in full), which will be deposited in the trust account and which  
      the underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our initial 
      business combination. If we consummate an initial business combination,     
      $3,700,000 ($4,255,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is        
      exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters as deferred discounts 
      and commissions (subject to a $0.296 per share reduction for public 
      stockholders who exercise their conversion rights).

(3)   These expenses include any reimbursements to be made to our executive       
      officers and directors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in       
      performing due diligence and activities in connection with the evaluation of
      a potential business combination, as well as any potential fees that we may 
      pay to third parties, such as market research firms and other consultants,  
      that perform due diligence of a target business on our behalf (other than to
      the extent such fees are paid by our executive officers and directors on our
      behalf and such persons are reimbursed in the amount and to the extent of   
      such fees).                                                                 

(4)   The not yet identified miscellaneous expenses include, without limitation,  
      the reimbursement of our executive officers and directors for out-of-pocket 
      expenses in connection with this offering, such as roadshow expenses and    
      advances for offering costs made by them and not covered by the amounts set 
      aside for offering expenses set forth on the table above and costs and      
      expenses associated with our dissolution and liquidation.                    

We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units in this offering and
the sale of warrants in the private placement to acquire one or more operating
businesses in the business services industry.

After non-deferred expenses of this offering and the private placement,
$98,500,000 (or $113,005,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) will be placed in a trust account maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except for payment of taxes
and interest income earned, net of taxes payable, on the trust account of up to
$1,500,000 to fund our working capital requirements, the proceeds will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of an
initial business combination or our dissolution and liquidation. During the
12-month period following completion of the offering the amount that may be
distributed to us to fund our working capital requirements will be limited to
the greater of 50% of the interest income earned, net of taxes payable, and
$1,250,000. We expect to use the proceeds held in the trust account to acquire
one or more domestic or foreign operating businesses in the business services
industry. Interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable) will be
held in the trust account for use in consummating an initial business
combination or released to investors upon exercise of their conversion rights or
upon our dissolution and liquidation, as the case may be. However, we may not
use all of the funds remaining in the trust account in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the initial business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In
that event, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any
other net proceeds not expended, will constitute working capital for our
business after our initial business combination. While it is difficult to
determine what the specific operating expenses of our business after
consummation of an initial business combination may be, we expect that they may
include some or all of the following: capital expenditures, general ongoing
expenses, including overhead, payroll and costs involved in expanding markets
and in developing strategic acquisitions or alliances. In addition, we may use
any remaining proceeds held in the trust account to satisfy any unpaid
reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our executive officers and
directors, as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or similar fees or compensation
to the extent such expenses, fees or compensation exceed the available proceeds
not deposited in the trust account. If we consummate an initial business
combination, $3,700,000 (or $4,255,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters as deferred
discounts and compensation, as set forth in this prospectus (subject to a $0.296
per share reduction for public stockholders who exercise their conversion
rights).

Net proceeds of this offering and the private placement in the amount of
$500,000 will not be held in the trust account and may be used to fund our
operations up to the next 24 months, as described below.

We expect to use approximately $600,000 for legal, accounting and other expenses
attendant to the structuring and negotiation of an initial business combination,
$600,000 for expenses related to due diligence and investigation of prospective
target businesses, and $50,000 for legal and accounting fees relating to SEC
reporting obligations. We expect that due diligence of prospective target
businesses will be performed by some or all members of our executive officers
and directors and may include engaging market research and valuation firms as
well as other third-party consultants. None of our executive officers or
directors will receive any compensation for any due diligence efforts, other
than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf
while performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. Any
reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our discretion. To the 
extent such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited 
in the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by 
us unless and until we consummate a business combination.

We have agreed to pay Union Street Capital Management, LLC a monthly fee of
$7,500 for general and administrative services, including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. We believe that, based on rents and fees for
similar services in Alexandria, Virginia, the fees charged by Union Street
Capital Management, LLC are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
unaffiliated third parties.

We expect to use approximately $300,000 for premiums for director and officer
insurance for a 24-month period. In addition, we have reserved approximately
$60,000 for the payment of corporate franchise taxes. We intend to use the
excess working capital (approximately $210,000) for other expenses incurred in
structuring and negotiating an initial business combination and, if necessary,
to cover the costs and expenses associated with our dissolution and liquidation
(which we estimate would be in the range of $50,000 to $75,000). For example, we
may opt to make a deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in
connection with structuring and negotiating our initial business combination.
While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms
that specialize in business acquisitions, we may do so in the future to assist
us in locating suitable target businesses, in which event we may pay a finder’s
fee, or other compensation. We have not reserved any specific amounts for a
deposit, down payment, exclusivity fees, finder’s fees or similar fees or
compensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the available net
proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses
and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf. To the
extent that any such fees or compensation exceeds the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust account, we would not be able to pay such fees or
compensation unless we consummate an initial business combination. In addition,
the excess working capital will be used to cover miscellaneous expenses that we
have not yet identified, which may include, without limitation, the
reimbursement of our executive officers and directors for out-of-pocket expenses
in connection with this offering, such as roadshow expenses and advances for
offering costs made by them and not covered by the amounts set aside for
offering expenses described above.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering and the private placement,
we will have sufficient available funds to operate at least for the next 24
months, assuming that an initial business combination is not consummated during
that time. The amount of available proceeds is based on the executive officers’
and directors’ estimate of the amount needed to fund our operations for the next
24 months and to consummate a business combination. Those estimates may prove
inaccurate, especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to make a
deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with an
initial business combination or if we expend a significant portion of the
available proceeds in pursuit of an initial business combination that is not
consummated. If our estimates prove inaccurate, our ability to consummate an
initial business combination may be impaired, and if we are required to dissolve
and liquidate upon our failure to complete a business combination, the amount
distributed to our public stockholders could be subject to reduction compared to
our estimates as a result of the claims of creditors. 

However, if we do not have sufficient proceeds available to cover our expenses,
we may be required to obtain additional financing, either from our executive
officers and directors, Union Street Capital Management, LLC or third parties.
We may not be able to obtain additional financing, and none of our management,
including our executive officers and directors, our existing stockholders or
Union Street Capital Management, LLC is obligated to provide any additional
financing. If we do not have sufficient proceeds not held in the trust account
and cannot find additional financing, we may be required to dissolve and
liquidate prior to consummating an initial business combination.

Union Street Capital Management, LLC has loaned a total of $200,000 to us for
the payment of offering expenses. The loan is interest free and will be paid
upon the completion of this offering out of the gross proceeds.

The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be held in the trust account and invested only in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the 1940 Act, or securities issued by the United States so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act.

Other than (i) the repayment of the $200,000 loan described above and
(ii) administrative services arrangement for services rendered to us, no
compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid
to any of our executive officers, directors, or existing stockholders or any of
their respective affiliates prior to or in connection with the initial business
combination. However, our executive officers and directors will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as participating in the offering process,
identifying potential target businesses, and performing due diligence on
suitable business combinations. Since the role of our current executive officers
and directors after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have no
ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons
after an initial business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account,
including interest earned on its pro rata portion of the funds in the trust
account (net of taxes payable and after release of up to $1,500,000 of interest
income, after tax, to fund working capital requirements, including the costs of
our dissolution and liquidation), only in the event of our dissolution and
liquidation upon our failure to consummate an initial business combination or if
that public stockholder were to seek to convert shares into cash in connection
with our initial business combination that the public stockholder previously
voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $44.7 million, or
approximately $51.7 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, based on the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share
and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working
capital to fund anticipated operating losses, establish a public market for our
common stock, and facilitate future access to the public markets. We estimate
that we will use the proceeds of this offering as follows:
      
        º approximately $22 to $24 million of these net proceeds to fund the
          continued clinical development of STA-4783, including the initiation
          of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in metastatic melanoma in 2007 and
          the initiation of Phase 2 clinical trials in up to two other
          indications in 2007;

        º approximately $2 to $3 million of these net proceeds to fund the
          continued clinical development of apilimod, including the completion
          of our current Phase 2a clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and
          CVID and potentially the initiation of Phase 2b clinical trials in
          these indications, depending on the results of the Phase 2a trials;

        º approximately $10 to $12 million of these net proceeds to fund the
          continued research, preclinical and future clinical development of
          STA-9090, STA-9584 and our CRAC ion channel program; and

        º approximately $8 million to fund general corporate purposes, such as
          general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, working
          capital needs, prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual
          property, and the potential acquisition of, or investment in,
          technologies, products, or companies that complement our business.

We have no current understandings, commitments, or agreements with respect to
any acquisition of or investment in any technologies, products or companies.

    As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of
the particular uses for the proceeds from this offering, or the amounts that we
will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the progress of
our research, development, and commercialization efforts, the progress of our
clinical trials, whether or not we enter into strategic collaborations or
partnerships, and our operating costs and expenditures. Accordingly, our
management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering.

    The costs and timing of drug development and regulatory approval,
particularly conducting clinical trials, are highly uncertain, are subject to
substantial risks, and can often change. Accordingly, we may change the
allocation of use of these proceeds as a result of contingencies such as the
progress and results of our clinical trials and other research and development
activities, the establishment of collaborations, the results of our
commercialization efforts, our manufacturing requirements and regulatory or
competitive developments. In addition, assuming our current clinical programs
proceed further to the next stage of clinical development, we do not expect our
existing capital resources and the net proceeds from this offering to be
sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of all such clinical development
programs through commercial introduction. Accordingly, we expect we will need to
raise additional funds. Based on our current operating plans, we expect proceeds
of this offering together with our existing resources, to be sufficient to fund
our planned operations, including, our continued research and drug development,
through at least mid-2008.

    Pending use of the proceeds from this offering as described above or
otherwise, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing,
investment grade securities."

common stock in this offering at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated
expenses. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $71.7 million.
 
The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working
capital, establish a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
future access to public markets. We anticipate using the net proceeds of this
offering to:
 
      •  expand the clinical development of our lead targeted radiotherapeutic   
         candidates for cancer (approximately $20.0 million);                    
     
      •  continue the development and prepare for the commercialization of       
         Zemiva, our lead molecular imaging pharmaceutical candidate             
         (approximately $22.0 million);                                          
     
      •  fund investment in manufacturing capacity for Zemiva and Azedra in      
         collaboration with our anticipated commercial manufacturing partner(s)  
         (approximately $4.0 million);                                           
     
      •  in-license technology or invest in businesses, products or technologies 
         that are complementary to our own (approximately $5.0 million);         
     
      •  advance our pre-clinical development of new product candidates          
         (approximately $5.0 million);                                           
     
      •  expand our research and development programs (approximately             
         $5.0 million); and                                                      
     
      •  fund other working capital and general corporate activities             
         (approximately $0.9 million).                                           
 
We may use a portion of the net proceeds for the repayment of the remaining
portion of a $5 million loan and related interest under the terms of a Loan and
Security Agreement with BlueCrest Venture Finance Master Fund Limited, assignee
of Ritchie Multi-Strategy Global, L.L.C., dated as of September 30, 2005. The
proceeds of this borrowing have been used for working capital and general
corporate activities. The obligations are secured by a first priority security
interest in our assets excluding intellectual property. We are required to pay
interest only during the first three months of the term of this loan, and
thereafter the entire loan will amortize over 35 months with equal monthly
principal and interest payments. The interest rate of the debt is 7.93%. In
connection with this financing arrangement, we are obligated to pay a fee to
BlueCrest in the amount of $300,000 should a liquidation event, such as an
initial public offering, occur. A liquidation event is defined in the agreement
as including, among other things, a change in control, a sale of all or
substantially all of our assets or an initial public offering of our common
stock.
 
We expect to use approximately $17,744 of the net proceeds to pay to certain
existing preferred stockholders a one-time cash dividend; all other preferred
stockholders chose to convert their accrued dividends into our common stock.
 
The amounts and timing of our use of proceeds will vary depending on a number of
factors, including the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, the
success of our product development efforts, competitive and technological
developments, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. As of the date of
this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for
the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the allocation of the
net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, we will invest
the net proceeds of this offering in cash, cash-equivalents, money market funds
or short-term interest-bearing, investment-grade securities to the extent
consistent with applicable regulations. We cannot predict whether the proceeds
will be invested to yield a favorable return.

Based on our operating plans, we believe that the proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash resources and government grant funding will be
sufficient to finance our planned operations, including increases in spending
for our Azedra, Onalta and Zemiva clinical programs and for our preclinical
product candidates into the second half of 2008. During the second half of 2008,
we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and
to complete clinical development of our product candidates. At that time, and
based on current projections which are subject to change, we expect that our
current product candidates will not yet be approved by the FDA, and that Azedra
will have completed a Phase 2 registrational clinical trial, Onalta will be in a
Phase 2 clinical trial, and Zemiva will have completed a pivotal Phase 2
clinical trial to support registration. We project that we will require between
$70 million to $100 million in additional capital to fund our operations through
the commercialization of our first product candidate. We may obtain this funding
by a variety of means in the future, including through debt and equity
financings and strategic partnering arrangements and collaborations."

(1)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid, or will be paid, from
     funds we received in the form of loans in an aggregate amount equal to
     $250,000 from Oenoke Partners, LLC, as described below. These loans will be
     repaid by us out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the
     trust account upon consummation of this offering. Interest accrued and
     unpaid on the loans through November 30, 2006 is approximately $2,917.

(2)  The underwriters have agreed to defer $7,250,000 of their underwriting
     discount (or $8,262,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full),
     which equals 3.22% of the gross proceeds of this offering (or 3.19% if the
     underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), until
     consummation of a business combination. Upon consummation of a business
     combination such deferred discount will be released to the underwriters and
     any public stockholders exercising their conversion rights out of the proceeds
     of this offering held in the trust account. The underwriters will not be
     entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred discount.

(3)  Assumes a monthly base rent of $10,203 for first year of lease beginning on
     October 1, 2006 and ending on September 30, 2007, as well as the exercise
     by our company of its option to extend this lease for two additional
     six-month periods, during which renewal periods our company's monthly base
     rent would be $13,203.

(4)  The maximum amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain
     constant at $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. We currently
     estimate that we would require approximately $50,000 to $75,000 to
     implement our stockholder approved plan of dissolution and distribution in
     the event we do not consummate a business combination. To the extent such
     funds are not available, Oenoke Partners, LLC has agreed to advance us the
     necessary funds and has agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses,
     though it has not taken a reserve for this possibility and there can be no
     assurance that it will be able to meet its obligations under this
     agreement.

    We will place $221,650,000, or $254,050,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the net proceeds of this offering
and the private placement in a trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee.
The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of a business combination and our liquidation. We expect to use
$7,250,000 of proceeds held in the trust account to pay the deferred
underwriting discount (or $8,262,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised
in full), up to $3,000,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of
taxes payable on such interest), plus $500,000 not held in the trust account to
cover our operating expenses and the remaining proceeds held in the trust
account as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business or to effect other acquisitions, including the payment of any finders'
fees or other similar costs or expenses as well as the expenses of identifying
and evaluating such target business, the selection of such target business, and
structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination, or for any
such other purpose, as may be determined by our board of directors at that time.

    We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our officers, directors or senior advisors and may
include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Such
market research firms and/or third party consultants will be paid out of the
funds allocated for due diligence. Our officers, directors and senior advisors
will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed from the funds allocated for due diligence
investigation for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred
in connection with such due diligence activities attendant to consummating a
business transaction. To the extent funds not held in the trust account and up
to $3,000,000 of interest income released to us from the trust account are
insufficient to reimburse management for out-of-pocket expenses, the obligation
to repay advances by management may be assumed by the resulting entity
following, and subject to, the consummation of a business combination.

    Our principal stockholder, Oenoke Partners, LLC, which is an affiliate of
our officers, has advanced to us, pursuant to two separate loans, a total of
$250,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering. The
first loan, for $100,000, bears interest at a rate of 5% per annum, compounded
semiannually, and is due on the earlier of August 1, 2007 and the consummation
of this offering. The second loan, for $150,000, also bears interest at a rate
of 5% per annum, compounded semiannually, and is due on the earlier of
October 3, 2007 and the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account.

    We may use a portion of the working capital, including any interest released
to us from the trust account, to make a deposit, down payment or fund a
""no-shop"" provision with respect to a particular proposed business combination,
although we do not have any current intention to do so. The amount that would 
be used as a down payment or lock-up payment would be determined based on the 
terms of the specific business combination. If we are ultimately required to 
forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating 
to such payment or otherwise), we would have less funds available to us to 
conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to finding another 
suitable business combination and might be unable to complete a business 
combination without borrowing funds. If we were unable to secure additional 
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in 
the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate. We do not anticipate paying 
finders' fees or other similar payments prior to the consummation of a business 
combination and any such payments would be made only in connection with the 
consummation of the business combination.

    Under the tabular disclosure of ""Use of Net Proceeds Not Held in Trust, and
Up to $3,000,000 of the Interest Earned on Our Trust Account (Net of Taxes
Payable) That May Be Released to Us to Cover Our Operating Expenses"" we have
included estimates of the amount of expenses that we are likely to incur in
connection with: (1) legal, accounting and other expenses incurred in connection
with a business combination; (2) legal and accounting fees relating to SEC
reporting obligations and (3) rent for office space. As the amounts are
estimates, our board may determine that it is advisable that the amount of
""working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, potential
deposits, down payments or funding of a 'no-shop' provision in connection with a
business combination and reserves including for costs of dissolution and
liquidation, if necessary,"" as provided for under the tabular disclosure of ""Use
of Net Proceeds Not Held in Trust, and Up to $3,000,000 of the Interest Earned
on Our Trust Account (Net of Taxes Payable) That May Be Released to Us to Cover
Our Operating Expenses"" may be increased or decreased to the extent that the
actual amount of legal, accounting and other expenses and rent for office space
described above differs from the estimated amounts that are provided for in the
table.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business or to acquire other businesses.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ""government securities,"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less so that
we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
Interest income, net of taxes payable with respect to such interest, of up to
$3,000,000 on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the trust
account to fund a portion of our working capital and other requirements.
Following completion of this offering, we believe the funds available to us from
outside the trust account, together with interest income (net of taxes on such
income) of up to $3,000,000 on the balance of the trust account to be released
to us for working capital and other requirements, will be sufficient to allow us
to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming a business combination is
not completed during that time. However, there is no assurance that the net
proceeds not held in trust will be sufficient to cover the expenses attendant to
consummating a business combination.

    No compensation of any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will be
paid by us, Oenoke Partners, LLC or any of our respective affiliates to any of
our officers, directors or senior advisors or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our officers, directors, senior advisors and
affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. 
To the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in 
the trust account or released to us from the trust account described above, we 
would not reimburse such out-of-pocket expenses unless we consummate a business 
combination. It is possible that certain of our officers, directors or senior advisors may be
employed or retained by a target business after the business combination in 
some capacity. However, since the role of any of those individuals after a 
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation of our trust account as part of
our plan of dissolution and distribution or if that public stockholder were to
seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination
which such public stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

     $250,000 from Oenoke Partners, LLC, as described below. These loans will be
     repaid by us out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the

     consummation of a business combination. Upon consummation of a business
     combination such deferred discount will be released to the underwriters and
     any public stockholders exercising their conversion rights out of the proceeds
     of this offering held in the trust account. The underwriters will not be
     entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred discount.

The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of a business combination and our liquidation. We expect to use
$7,250,000 of proceeds held in the trust account to pay the deferred
underwriting discount (or $8,262,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised
in full), up to $3,000,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of
taxes payable on such interest), plus $500,000 not held in the trust account to
cover our operating expenses and the remaining proceeds held in the trust
account as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business or to effect other acquisitions, including the payment of any finders'
fees or other similar costs or expenses as well as the expenses of identifying
and evaluating such target business, the selection of such target business, and
structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination, or for any
such other purpose, as may be determined by our board of directors at that time.

    We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our officers, directors or senior advisors and may
include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Such
market research firms and/or third party consultants will be paid out of the
funds allocated for due diligence. Our officers, directors and senior advisors
will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed from the funds allocated for due diligence
investigation for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred
in connection with such due diligence activities attendant to consummating a
business transaction. To the extent funds not held in the trust account and up
to $3,000,000 of interest income released to us from the trust account are
insufficient to reimburse management for out-of-pocket expenses, the obligation
to repay advances by management may be assumed by the resulting entity
following, and subject to, the consummation of a business combination.

    Our principal stockholder, Oenoke Partners, LLC, which is an affiliate of
our officers, has advanced to us, pursuant to two separate loans, a total of
$250,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering. The
first loan, for $100,000, bears interest at a rate of 5% per annum, compounded
semiannually, and is due on the earlier of August 1, 2007 and the consummation
of this offering. The second loan, for $150,000, also bears interest at a rate
of 5% per annum, compounded semiannually, and is due on the earlier of
October 3, 2007 and the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account.

    We may use a portion of the working capital, including any interest released
to us from the trust account, to make a deposit, down payment or fund a
""no-shop"" provision with respect to a particular proposed business combination,
although we do not have any current intention to do so. The amount that would 
be used as a down payment or lock-up payment would be determined based on the 
terms of the specific business combination. If we are ultimately required to 
forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating 
to such payment or otherwise), we would have less funds available to us to 
conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to finding another 
suitable business combination and might be unable to complete a business 
combination without borrowing funds. If we were unable to secure additional 
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in 
the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate. We do not anticipate paying 
finders' fees or other similar payments prior to the consummation of a business 
combination and any such payments would be made only in connection with the 
consummation of the business combination.

    Under the tabular disclosure of ""Use of Net Proceeds Not Held in Trust, and
Up to $3,000,000 of the Interest Earned on Our Trust Account (Net of Taxes
Payable) That May Be Released to Us to Cover Our Operating Expenses"" we have
included estimates of the amount of expenses that we are likely to incur in
connection with: (1) legal, accounting and other expenses incurred in connection
with a business combination; (2) legal and accounting fees relating to SEC
reporting obligations and (3) rent for office space. As the amounts are
estimates, our board may determine that it is advisable that the amount of
""working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, potential
deposits, down payments or funding of a 'no-shop' provision in connection with a
business combination and reserves including for costs of dissolution and
liquidation, if necessary,"" as provided for under the tabular disclosure of ""Use
of Net Proceeds Not Held in Trust, and Up to $3,000,000 of the Interest Earned
on Our Trust Account (Net of Taxes Payable) That May Be Released to Us to Cover
Our Operating Expenses"" may be increased or decreased to the extent that the
actual amount of legal, accounting and other expenses and rent for office space
described above differs from the estimated amounts that are provided for in the
table.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business or to acquire other businesses.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ""government securities,"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less so that
we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
Interest income, net of taxes payable with respect to such interest, of up to
$3,000,000 on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the trust
account to fund a portion of our working capital and other requirements.
Following completion of this offering, we believe the funds available to us from
outside the trust account, together with interest income (net of taxes on such
income) of up to $3,000,000 on the balance of the trust account to be released
to us for working capital and other requirements, will be sufficient to allow us
to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming a business combination is
not completed during that time. However, there is no assurance that the net
proceeds not held in trust will be sufficient to cover the expenses attendant to
consummating a business combination.

    No compensation of any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will be
paid by us, Oenoke Partners, LLC or any of our respective affiliates to any of
our officers, directors or senior advisors or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our officers, directors, senior advisors and
affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. 
To the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in 
the trust account or released to us from the trust account described above, we 
would not reimburse such out-of-pocket expenses unless we consummate a business 
combination. It is possible that certain of our officers, directors or senior advisors may be
employed or retained by a target business after the business combination in 
some capacity. However, since the role of any of those individuals after a 
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what 
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business 
combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation of our trust account as part of
our plan of dissolution and distribution or if that public stockholder were to
seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination
which such public stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

--------
(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from advances we received  
    from Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Hantke as described below. These advances will be 
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon   
    consummation of this offering.                                               

(2) Some of these expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some  
    or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For    
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business          
    combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. 
    We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than  
    fluctuations among the categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, 
    to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of     
    expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.                 

(3) The amount of underwriting discount and the amount held in trust include $7.2
    million (or $8.28 million if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) 
    that will be paid to the underwriters upon consummation of the initial       
    business combination and will not be available to us. In the event that we do
    not consummate our initial business combination within the required time     
    period, the underwriters will forfeit any right to that amount, which will be
    included in the liquidation distribution to our public stockholders.         

A total of approximately $234,775,000 (or approximately $269,335,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including
$227,575,000 of the net proceeds from this offering, the sale of the initial
founders’ securities (or $261,055,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full) and $7.2 million (or $8.28 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions will be placed in a trust account at Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.,
with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company as trustee. Except for a portion of
the interest income to be released to us (as described in more detail below),
the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation. In the event that we consummate an initial business combination,
all amounts held in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions of $7.2 million (or $8.28 million if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full), which will be paid to the underwriters) that are not
(i) paid to public stockholders exercising their conversion rights or
(ii) previously released to us as described below to pay income taxes or as
working capital, will be released to us upon the closing of our initial business
combination, which must involve one or more target businesses with a fair market
value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of such
business combination. If our initial business combination involves a transaction
in which we acquire less than a 100% interest in the target business, the value
of the interest that we acquire will be equal to at least 80% of the balance in
the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of
$7.2 million, or $8.28 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full). The funds released to us may be used to pay all or a portion
of the purchase price of our initial business combination. We may apply any
funds released to us from the trust account not used to pay the purchase
price—for example, because we paid all or a portion of the purchase price for
our initial business combination using stock or debt securities—for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of an
acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies, or for working capital.

We have allocated $500,000 of the offering proceeds to fund a portion of our
working capital, including to repay certain advances from our officers that went
to cover expenses associated with this offering, as described below. We intend
to fund the majority of our working capital requirements from a portion of the
interest earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account. Under the terms
of the investment management trust agreement, up to $3.25 million of interest
(net of taxes payable) may be released to us in such amounts and at such
intervals as we request, subject to availability and to the maximum cap of $3.25
million. Although we do not know the rate of interest to be earned on the trust
account and are unable to predict an exact amount of time it will take to
complete an initial business combination, we believe that following the
completion of this offering, it will take some time to find a prospective target
and take all of the steps necessary to complete an initial business combination.
We anticipate that, even at an interest rate of 3% per annum, the interest that
will accrue on the trust account during the time it will take to identify a
target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working
capital requirements. However, if interest payments are not sufficient to fund
these requirements, or are not available to fund the expenses at the time we
incur them, we may be required to seek additional capital from third parties. In
such event, we might seek loans or additional investments from our officers or
directors or other third parties. However, our officers and directors are under 
no obligation to advance funds to us or to invest in us. If we do obtain loans 
from a third party, we would seek to have the lender enter into a valid and 
enforceable agreement waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind 
in or to any monies held in the trust account. However, there can be no 
assurance that any lender would execute such an agreement, and if we are 
unable to find a lender from whom we can obtain loans (or from whom we can 
obtain loans on reasonable terms) that is willing to execute a waiver agreement, 
we may obtain loans from a third party that has not executed a waiver agreement.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of our officers and directors, and also that it may include
engaging market research firms or third-party consultants. No compensation of
any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our
officers or directors, or any of our or their affiliates, for services rendered
to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination, including in connection with such due diligence activities.
However, our officers and directors will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred by them in connection
with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses
and performing due diligence on a suitable initial business combination. Our
audit committee will review and approve all payments made to our officers,
directors or our or their affiliates, and any payments made to members of our
audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with
the interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval.

In addition, it is also possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in
the trust account to pay finder’s fees, consulting fees or other similar
compensation, or make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with
respect to a particular proposed initial business combination, although we do
not have any current intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately
required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the
agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), if the amount were large
enough and we had already used up the other funds available to us, we could be
left with insufficient funds to continue searching for other potential target
businesses or otherwise fund our business. In such case, if we were unable to
secure additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate an initial
business combination in the allotted time and be forced to liquidate.

We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income of up
to $3.25 million earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us
will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses for which such proceeds have
been allocated. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence
will be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent
or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount of such costs, we may be required to raise additional capital, the
amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. To the
extent that such expenses exceed the amounts not held in the trust account and
the interest income of up to $3.25 million that may be released to us from the
trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses could not be reimbursed by us unless
we consummate an initial business combination. Since the role of present
management after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have no
current ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to present
management after our initial business combination. Our officers and directors
may, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of
the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them that have not been reimbursed prior
to the initial business combination’s closing. If the target business’s owners
do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our officers and directors to
view such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in a
conflict of interest.

As of October 15, 2006, Mr. Rodriguez, our chief executive officer and a member
of our board of directors, had advanced on our behalf a total of $44,351, and
Mr. Hantke, our principal financial officer and a member of our board of
directors, had advanced on our behalf a total of $5,183, which amounts together
were used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above including certain organizational expenses. These advances are
non-interest bearing and unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30, 2007,
or the consummation of this offering. The advances will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect our initial business combination, the proceeds held in
the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to
finance the operations of the combined business.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities” (as such term is defined in the Investment
Company Act) and one or more money market funds, selected by us, which invest
principally in either short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United
States having a rating in the highest investment category granted thereby by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or tax exempt
municipal bonds issued by governmental entities located within the United
States, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of our liquidation if we fail to complete our initial business
combination within the allotted time or if the public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with an initial business combination that the
public stockholder voted against and that we actually complete. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
in or to funds in the trust account. The funds a public stockholder will be
entitled to receive from the trust account would include interest earned on his,
her or its portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable with respect to
such interest, and less interest income released to us from the trust account in
the manner described above and, in the event of our liquidation for failure to
consummate an initial business combination within the allotted time, interest of
up to $75,000 that may be released to us should we have no or insufficient
working capital to fund the costs and expenses of our dissolution and
liquidation.

On completion of an initial business combination, the underwriters will receive
the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust account.
If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee must
therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation, the
underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interest
thereon, in the trust account, and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to
distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with
any accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, on a
pro rata basis to the public stockholders."

the net proceeds to us from the sale of 4,700,000 shares of common stock that we
are selling in this offering will be approximately $67.8 million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised
in full, we estimate we will receive net proceeds for the total offering of
approximately $78.3 million.

Of the net proceeds from this offering, we expect to use approximately:

        º $29.0 million for clinical trials;

        º $19.0 million for research and development activities; and

        º $19.0 million for building our commercial infrastructure, including
          sales and marketing and manufacturing capacity expansion.

We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for
working capital and general corporate purposes. The amounts actually spent for
these purposes may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors,
including our operating costs, capital expenditures and other factors described
under ""Risk Factors."" While we have no present understandings, commitments or
agreements to enter into any potential acquisitions, we may also use a portion
of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies or
products that complement our business. Accordingly, management will retain broad
discretion as to the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering.

Pending the uses described above, we will invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. We cannot
predict whether the proceeds will yield a favorable return."
CAPITAL PRODUCT PARTNERS L.P.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/capital-product-partners-lp-738265-53781,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/capital-product-partners-lp-738265-53781,424B1,3/30/2007,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=5070669,"The common units being offered by this prospectus, including the common
units offered if the underwriters' overallotment option is exercised, are solely
for the account of Capital Maritime. We will not receive any proceeds from the
sale of our common units by Capital Maritime. Capital Maritime will pay all
offering expenses, underwriting discounts, financial advisory fees, selling
commissions and brokerage fees, if any, incurred in connection with this
offering, assuming no exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option.

       Capital Maritime has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase
up to 1,762,500 additional common units to cover overallotments. Upon notice by
the underwriters of the exercise of their overallotment option in full or in
part, we will issue to Capital Maritime a number of common units equal to the
number of common units for which the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option. The underwriters will then purchase those units from Capital Maritime to
cover overallotments, and the amount of the $30 million dividend payable by us
in cash to Capital Maritime will be reduced by the net proceeds received by
Capital Maritime in connection with the exercise of the overallotment option. If
the product of the number of units we issue to Capital Maritime in connection
with the exercise of the overallotment option and the public offering price,
less the underwriting discount payable by Capital Maritime to the underwriters,
is less than $30 million, we will pay the difference to Capital Maritime in cash
upon the later of the full exercise of the overallotment option or 30 days after
the date of this prospectus. If the product of the number of units we issue to
Capital Maritime in connection with the exercise of the overallotment option and
the public offering price, less the underwriting discount payable by Capital
Maritime to the underwriters, is equal to or more than $30 million, Capital
Maritime will not receive any additional cash dividend, but only the common
units necessary to satisfy the underwriters' overallotment option and will
retain the entire amount of such net proceeds, including any excess over
$30 million. We will account for the distribution to Capital Maritime of the
common units necessary to satisfy the underwriters' overallotment as a common
unit dividend, which will have no net impact on partners' equity. 

       Capital Maritime expects to use approximately $54 million of the net
proceeds that it will receive from this offering to repay borrowings outstanding
under a loan agreement under which Fortis Bank, an affiliate of Fortis
Securities LLC, is a lender. This loan bears interest at a rate of 0.90% over
US$ LIBOR and matures in February 2017."

presently intend to contribute substantially all of the net proceeds of this
offering to Flagstone to increase the underwriting capacity of its reinsurance

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, raise additional equity capital and facilitate future access to
public markets. We intend to use approximately $1.8 million of the net proceeds
of this offering to repay interest owing on the May 2006 convertible promissory
notes, the repayment of which accelerates and becomes due as a result of the
completion of this offering. The $1.8 million interest owed, which is equal to
22.5% of the principal, is required to be paid in cash within 60 days after
closing of this offering. The proceeds from the May 2006 convertible promissory
notes were used to fund our operations from May 2006 through the closing of this
offering. We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds of this offering to
support continued growth, including approximately:

    •   $24.0 million for sales and marketing initiatives to support the ongoing   
        commercialization of our EnCor system and other products and products under
        development; and

purposes. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering
to repay all or a portion of the 2006 subordinated note, or acquire or invest in
complementary product lines, technologies or companies, through mergers,
acquisitions, joint ventures or otherwise. However, we have no specific
agreements or commitments at present and are not currently engaged in any
negotiations with respect to these transactions. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon numerous factors,
including the progress of our research, development and commercialization
efforts, and our operating costs and capital expenditures. Accordingly, our
management will retain broad discretion as to the allocation of the net proceeds
of this offering.

Prior to their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, high-grade interest-bearing marketable securities, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. We believe
that our current cash and cash equivalents, excluding the net proceeds from this
offering, together with cash expected to be generated from sales of our product
offerings and our ability to draw down on our secured revolving line of credit
and equipment advance facility, will be sufficient to meet our projected

(1)   A portion of the Company’s offering and operating expenses have been paid, or
      will be paid, from funds we received in the form of a $305,000 loan from     
      Santa Monica Capital Partners, LLC, as described below. The loan will be     
      repaid by us by our issuance of 38,125 units to Santa Monica Capital         
      Partners, LLC in the private placement referred to above prior to the        
      completion of this offering. Therefore, the $305,000 loan amount is included 
      in the gross proceeds to be received by us from the private placement.       

(2)   The underwriters have agreed to defer $4,000,000 of their underwriting       
      discount (or $4,600,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full),  
      which equals 4.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering, until consummation 
      of a business combination. Upon consummation of a business combination such  
      deferred discount will be released to the underwriters out of the proceeds of
      this offering held in the trust account. The underwriters will not be        
      entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred discount.                   
 
(3)   Interest accrued and unpaid on the loan from Santa Monica Capital Partners,  
      LLC through December 31, 2006 is approximately $18,100, and will be forgiven 
      upon consummation of this offering.                                          
 
(4)   The maximum amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain     
      constant at $100,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. We currently   
      estimate that we would require approximately $50,000 to $75,000 to 
      implement our stockholder approved plan of dissolution and distribution 
      in the event we do not consummate a business combination.       

We will place $98,605,000, or $113,080,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full, of the net proceeds of this offering and the
private placement in a trust account at Royal Bank of Canada maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. We expect to use
$4,000,000 of proceeds held in the trust account to pay the deferred
underwriting discount (or $4,600,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised
in full), up to $1,600,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of
taxes payable on such interest), plus $100,000 not held in the trust account to
cover our operating expenses and the remaining proceeds held in the trust
account as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business or to effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of
directors at that time.
 
We have agreed to pay to Santa Monica Capital Corp., an affiliate of our Chief
Executive Officer, David Marshall, a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. We have accrued an aggregate fee of $45,000 for the six-month period
from July 5, 2005 to January 5, 2006. We have agreed with Santa Monica Capital
Corp. that no monthly fee will accrue for the period from January 5, 2006 until
the six-month anniversary of the completion of this offering, at which time we
will pay to Santa Monica Capital Corp. the entire accrued amount of $45,000 for
the period prior to January 5, 2006. During each month following the six-month
anniversary of the completion of this offering, we will pay a fee of $7,500 to
Santa Monica Capital Corp. Our obligation to pay such fees will terminate as
soon as we have paid aggregate fees of $180,000 to Santa Monica Capital Corp.
or, if earlier, upon the completion of our initial business combination. We
anticipate paying the administrative fee to Santa Monica Capital Corp. out of
interest income, net of income taxes payable, of up to $1,600,000 to be released
to us from the trust account.
 
The arrangement with Santa Monica Capital Corp. is for our benefit and is not
intended to provide any of our officers or directors with compensation in lieu
of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the Los
Angeles, California area that the fee charged by Santa Monica Capital Corp. is
at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.
 
We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of our officers and directors and may include engaging market
research firms and/or third party consultants. Such market research firms and/or
third party consultants will be paid out of the funds allocated for due
diligence. Our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed
from the funds allocated for due diligence investigation for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities attendant to consummating a business transaction. To the
extent funds not held in the trust account and up to $1,600,000 released to us
from the trust account are insufficient to reimburse management for
out-of-pocket expenses, the obligation to repay advances by management may be
assumed by the resulting entity following, and subject to, the consummation of a
business combination.
 
Santa Monica Capital Partners, LLC, an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer
and other officers and directors, has advanced to us a total of $305,000, which
was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for the SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, American Stock
Exchange filing fee, and accounting and legal fees and expenses, as well as our
operating expenses. The loan bears interest of 5% per annum and is due on the
earlier of April 30, 2007 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will be
repaid in full by our issuance of 38,125 units to Santa Monica Capital, LLC
prior to the completion of this offering.
 
We intend to use estimated working capital of $60,000 for director and officer
liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve for other
purposes.

We may use a portion of the interest released to us from the trust account to
make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. The amount that would be used as a down payment or lock-up
payment would be determined based on the terms of the specific business
combination. If we are ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as a
result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), we
would have less funds available to us to conduct due diligence and pay other
expenses related to finding another suitable business combination and might be
unable to complete a business combination without borrowing funds. If we were
unable to secure additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a
business combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate. We
do not anticipate paying finders’ fees or other similar payments prior to the
consummation of a business combination, and any such payments would be made only
in connection with the consummation of the business combination.
 
We reserve the right to reallocate our use of the net proceeds of this offering
not held in the trust account, and to use interest that is released to us from
the trust account, in such manner as is determined to be appropriate by our
board of directors.
 
To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business or to acquire other businesses.
 
The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities,” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, having a maturity of 180 days or less, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Interest income, net of taxes payable with respect to such interest, of up
to $1,600,000 on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the trust
account to fund a portion of our working capital and other requirements.
Following completion of this offering, we believe the funds available to us from
outside the trust account, together with interest income (net of taxes on such
income) of up to $1,600,000 on the balance of the trust account to be released
to us for working capital and other requirements, will be sufficient to allow us
to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming a business combination is
not completed during that time. However, there is no assurance that the net
proceeds not held in trust will be sufficient to cover the expenses attendant to
consummating a business combination.
 
Commencing on the six-month anniversary of the completion of this offering until
we have paid aggregate fees of $180,000 (or, if earlier, until the completion of
our initial business combination), we will pay Santa Monica Capital Corp. the
fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee and
other than the repayment to Santa Monica Capital Partners, LLC of the $305,000
loan described above by issuance of 38,125 units, no compensation of any kind
(including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our officers,
directors or advisory board members or any of their affiliates, for services
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business
combination. However, our officers, directors, or advisory board members and any
of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account or released to us from the trust
account as described above, we will not reimburse such out-of-pocket expenses
unless we consummate a business combination. It is possible that certain of our
officers and directors may be employed or retained by a target business after
the business combination in some capacity. However, since the role of any of
those individuals after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
such public stockholder has voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

5,500,000 ADSs in this offering will be approximately $65.9 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
our net proceeds will be approximately $76.2 million.

    We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering to repay our two term
loans in full, to repay some or all of our revolving line of credit and for
general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures.
We have a term loan that is payable in monthly installments of $333,000, bears
interest at the bank’s prime rate plus 4.0% and matures on May 25, 2009. As of
December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance of this term loan was $11.0 million.
Our second term loan is for $17.5 million, bears interest at the bank’s prime
rate plus 7.5% and matures on May 25, 2009. As of December 31, 2006, the
outstanding balance of this term loan was $17.5 million. Our $25.0 million
revolving line of credit bears interest at the bank’s prime rate plus 1.0% and
matures on May 25, 2009. As of December 31, 2006, we had $1.6 million of
borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit. If we were to repay
all of our revolving line of credit and our two term loans in full, we would
discharge an aggregate of $30.1 million of our debt out of the proceeds from
this offering based on the outstanding balances as of December 31, 2006. We may
not repay the entire outstanding amount of our revolving line of credit. The
proceeds from our two term loans and our line of credit were used to fund our
acquisition of Phase 2, refinance existing indebtedness and fund working
capital, including capital expenditures.

    We have not yet determined all of our expected expenditures, and we cannot
estimate the amounts we will use for each purpose set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. Pending our use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities."

the shares of common stock offered by us in this offering, based upon the
initial public offering price of $11.00 per share, after deducting underwriting

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets.
 
Based on our current cash and cash equivalents balances, we do not expect that
we will have to utilize the net proceeds of this offering to fund our operations
during the 12 months following this offering. We currently plan to use the net
proceeds received by us from this offering for working capital and general
corporate purposes, including further expansion of our sales and support
functions for both direct and indirect sales channels. Specifically, we plan to
hire additional personnel and anticipate incurring additional facilities costs
associated with such increased sales headcount. We also expect to increase
investments in research and development by hiring additional engineers. In
addition, we may use a portion of the proceeds of this offering for acquisitions
of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. We have no current
agreements, commitments, plans, proposals or arrangements, written or otherwise,
with respect to any material acquisitions.
 
Pending such uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds in short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses including SEC registration fees, NASD    
      filing fees, AMEX listing fees and legal and accounting fees have been paid 
      from loans we received from Messrs. Wasserman and Blaha described below.    
      These loaned funds will be repaid without interest out of the proceeds of   
      this offering and the interest income earned on the trust account.          
   
(2)   Represents 3.3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 6,000,000 units  
      in this offering ($1,980,000) and 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of 
      the 900,000 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option.       
   
(3)   Represents 3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 6,000,000 units in 
      this offering ($1,800,000) and 5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the
      900,000 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option            
      ($2,250,000, assuming that the underwriters exercise the over-allotment     
      option in full) that Maxim Group LLC agreed to deposit into the trust       
      account and forfeit (including interest earned thereon) in the event we do  
      not complete a business combination. These amounts will be paid to Maxim    
      Group LLC only upon completion of a business combination and then only with 
      respect to those units as to which the component shares have not been       
      redeemed. If we do not complete a business combination and the trust account
      is liquidated, these amounts will be distributed among our public           
      stockholders.                                                               
   
(4)   Includes a portion of the legal fees ($90,000) related to the offering that 
      is being deferred and will be paid, without contingency, from interest      
      income earned from the trust account released to us for working capital.    
   
(5)   Represents $50,000 of an additional loan of up to $250,000 to be made by    
      Mr. Wasserman on or prior to the closing of this offering to pay for        
      offering expenses, which will be repaid within 90 days of the closing of    
      this offering. Interest income earned on the funds in the trust account will
      be used to repay this loan of up to $250,000 (which is non-interest bearing)
      along with: (i) taxes payable on interest income earned on the trust account
      and State of Delaware franchise taxes and (ii) up to $1,825,000 ($1,925,000 
      if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of interest income to    
      fund our working capital expenses.                                          
   
(6)   We expect to fund our operating expenses from interest income earned from   
      the trust account released to us. An aggregate of $1,825,000 ($1,925,000 if 
      the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the        
      interest earned on the trust account will be released to us to fund our     
      working capital requirements; however, if the underwriters’ over-allotment  
      option is exercised in full, after our receipt of $125,000 of interest      
      income we will not be permitted to draw such amounts until $180,000 (or a   
      lesser amount if less than the full over-allotment option is exercised, pro 
      rata based on the amount of the over-allotment exercised) of interest shall 
      have been earned on the trust account with the resulting effect that there  
      shall be a minimum of $10.00 per unit held in the trust account. We shall   
      not be entitled to draw upon the interest income earned on the $1,800,000 in
      deferred underwriting discounts (or $2,250,000 if the underwriters’         
      over-allotment option is exercised in full), which will be paid to Maxim    
      Group LLC if a business combination is consummated, but which will be       
      forfeited by Maxim Group LLC if a business combination is not consummated.  

On the closing date of this offering, $60,000,000, or $68,820,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in a
trust account at JP Morgan Chase NewYork, New York maintained by American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. This amount includes the net proceeds of
this offering and the private placement, and $1,800,000 ($2,250,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting compensation to be paid to Maxim Group LLC if and only if a
business combination is consummated.
 
We have agreed with Maxim Group LLC that we may withdraw interest earned on the
trust account (net of taxes payable) in an amount not to exceed $1,825,000
($1,925,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in
the aggregate, and that we can withdraw interest monthly (or weekly during the
first month after the offering), in order to fund our working capital needs and
expenses and dissolution and liquidation expenses if we fail to consummate a
business combination. Although we do not know the rate of interest to be earned
on the trust account, we believe that even at an interest rate of 3% per annum,
the interest available to us on the trust account less interest on the
underwriters’ $1,800,000 ($2,250,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full) deferred underwriting compensation, which is payable to
the underwriters if we complete a business combination will be sufficient to
fund our working capital requirements even if they exceed our estimates. The 
remaining proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account 
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the liquidation
of the trust account as part of any plan of dissolution and liquidation approved
by our stockholders. The proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of Maxim
Group LLC’s deferred underwriting compensation, including interest thereon held 
in the trust account or used to pay stockholders who have exercised their 
redemption right) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target 
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts 
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business (other than 
amounts paid for finders, or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or 
costs incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made in connection
with the business combination) may be used to finance operations of the target 
business.
 
We have agreed to pay ASG Management, Inc., an affiliated third party of which
Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Blaha are principals, $7,500 per month for office space
and certain additional general and administrative services.
 
Prior to the closing of a business combination, we have agreed to obtain key-man
life insurance in the amount of $2,000,000 on the life of Steven M. Wasserman
for a three year period.
 
We expect that identification, evaluation and due diligence of prospective
target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers and
directors, and may include engaging market research and valuation firms, as well
as other third party consultants. None of our officers and directors will
receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) they may
incur on our behalf while performing due diligence of a prospective target
business.
 
We intend to fund our working capital from a portion of the interest earned on
the proceeds being held in the trust account. We have agreed with the
representative of the underwriters that $1,825,000 (or $1,925,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the interest income
earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account for our benefit will be
released to us monthly, or weekly during the first month after the offering;
however, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, after
our receipt of $125,000 of interest income we will not be permitted to draw such
amounts until $180,000 (or a lesser amount if less than the full over-allotment
option is exercised, pro rata based on the amount of the over-allotment
exercised) of interest shall have been earned on the trust account with the
resulting effect that there shall be a minimum of $10.00 per unit held in the
trust account.
 
It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to make a
deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds
(whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or
otherwise), if such payment was large enough and we had already used up the
funds available for due diligence and related expenses in connection with the
aborted transaction, we could be left with insufficient funds to continue search
for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential target
businesses. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we would
most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and
would be forced to liquidate. Although there are no existing written or oral
agreements in place, or obligations on the part of our initial stockholders, it
is possible that our initial stockholders could advance us the additional
required funds, thereby increasing the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses
to be reimbursed following a business combination.
 
To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.
 
In May 2005, Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Blaha loaned us an aggregate of $187,800
which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering, such as SEC
registration fees, NASD registration fees, AMEX listing fees and legal and
accounting fees and expenses. Such loans will be payable without interest on the
closing of the offering. Prior to the closing date of this offering,
Mr. Wasserman will loan the Company up to an additional $250,000 to pay expenses
of this offering. The loan will be payable from accrued interest on the trust 
account within 90 days of the closing. We believe that the amount allocated to 
working capital, together with interest earned on the trust account available to
us, as described above, will be sufficient to cover the costs related to the 
acquisition of a target business and reimbursement costs, even if the costs of 
due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and 
negotiating a business combination exceed our estimates.
 
The net proceeds of this offering held in the trust account and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under
the Investment Company Act, as amended. By restricting the investment of the
proceeds of this offering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed
to be an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, as
amended. Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the
requirements of such act, in the event that the stockholders do not approve a
plan of dissolution and liquidation and the funds remain in the trust account
for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment
company and thus required to comply with such act. The interest income derived
from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed. We believe that, upon consummation of
this offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least
the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated
during that time.
 
We may not use all of the proceeds held in trust in connection with a business
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is
less than the proceeds in trust or because we have financed a portion of the
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event, the
proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any other net proceeds not
expended, will be used to finance the operations of the target businesses, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.
 
Other than the $7,500 per month general and administrative service fees
described above and the reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with a business combination, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our initial stockholders or
any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection
with the consummation of the business combination. However, our initial
stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. Prior to consummation of a business combination, such
reimbursement of expenses incurred by our initial stockholders shall only be
made from permitted distributions of interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account and any such expenses in excess of such interest earned on the
trust account will be reimbursed upon consummation of a business combination.
After the consummation of a business combination, if any, to the extent our
management remains as officers of the resulting business, we anticipate that
they may enter into employment agreements, the terms of which shall be
negotiated and which we expect to be comparable to employment agreements with
other similarly-situated companies in the homeland security and/or defense
industries. Further, after the consummation of a business combination, if any,
to the extent our directors remain as directors of the resulting business, we
anticipate that they will receive compensation comparable to directors at other
similarly-situated companies in the homeland security and/or defense industries.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of: (i) taxes payable on interest income earned on the trust account, State of
Delaware franchise taxes and repayment of up to $250,000 of an additional
officer loan on or prior to the closing of this offering by Steven M. Wasserman
and (ii) up to $1,825,000 ($1,925,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised
in full) of interest income released to us to fund our working capital and
dissolution and liquidation expenses if we fail to consummate a business
combination subject to certain conditions described in this prospectus), only in
the event of the liquidation of the trust account as part of our plan of
dissolution and liquidation approved by our stockholders upon our failure to
complete a business combination within the allotted time or if the public
stockholder were to seek to redeem such shares for cash in connection with a
business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we
actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have 
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event of 
our dissolution and liquidation, we will comply with the requirements of
Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which requires that we
pay or make provision for the payment of all claims and obligations to
creditors, including those we believe are likely to arise in the future, before
determining assets remaining for distribution to our stockholders. Under
Delaware Law, claims of our creditors will have priority over the distribution
to our stockholders of amounts held in the trust account."

7,300,000 shares of common stock that we are selling in this offering of
approximately $75.1 million, based on an initial public offering price of $11.50
per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses. To the extent that the underwriters sell more than
7,300,000 shares of common stock, the underwriters have the option to purchase
up to an additional 1,095,000 shares from us and certain selling stockholders,
which include our chief executive officer, other members of senior management
and an affiliate of a director, at the initial public offering price less the
underwriting discount. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares
in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $75.1 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares by the selling stockholders pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’
option, if it is exercised.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets. We intend to use approximately $10.9 million of
the net proceeds of this offering to repay in full the principal and accrued
interest on our outstanding loan from Pinnacle Ventures, based on amounts
accrued as of December 31, 2006. The loan has an interest rate of 11% and has a
maturity date of June 2009. We used the net proceeds of this loan for working
capital and general corporate purposes. We expect to use the remaining net
proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, including:
 
    •  expansion of our domestic and international sales and marketing activities,
       which may include increasing the number of our direct sales and marketing  
       personnel and investing in advertising and marketing to increase brand     
       awareness for specific games and for the Glu brand;                        
   
    •  expansion of our international development and quality assurance           
       capabilities in Asia Pacific, Latin America and EMEA, which may include    
       hiring additional personnel in current offices and opening new offices to  
       expand development and porting capacity;                                   
   
    •  activities to increase our carrier and other distribution channels;        
   
    •  possible advances for license agreements; and                              
   
    •  other corporate opportunities that may arise in the future.   

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or
investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our
business. However, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements
to enter into any acquisitions or make any investments.
 
We have not yet determined our anticipated expenditures and therefore cannot
estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above. The
amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash
generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the
rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering, and
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of these net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities. The goal with respect to the investment of these
net proceeds will be capital preservation and liquidity so that these funds are
readily available to fund our operations."

                  addition, $250,000 of interest income earned on the amounts    
                  held in the trust account will be available to us to pay for   
                  our working capital requirements if we have not completed a    
                  business combination by one year from the date of this         
                  prospectus. For purposes of presentation, the full amount      
                  available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds   
                  available to us immediately following the offering.            

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Harry Edelson, Nicholas
Puro, Barry M. Shereck, Rose-Marie Fox, Daxi Li, Eliot Clauss and John Allen
have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price
of $1,360,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a private placement
basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will not pay any
discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider warrants.
All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust
fund described below.

$33,200,000, or $38,357,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,360,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Merrill Lynch
& Co., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts
and commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters
have agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The funds
held in trust will be invested only in United States ‘‘government securities’’
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Except with respect to $250,000 of interest income that may be
released to us following the one year anniversary of the date of this
prospectus, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination.

The payment to Edelson Technology Inc., an affiliate of Harry Edelson, our
chairman of the board and chief executive officer, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Edelson Technology
Inc. for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Edelson compensation in
lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in
the New York metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Edelson Technology Inc.
is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.
This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the
$7,500 per month administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, stockholders, special advisors or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the
consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to
‘‘Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the due diligence
investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business combination,’’ ‘‘Due
diligence of prospective target businesses’’ and ‘‘Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, taxes and reserves.’’ Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $500,000. We intend to use the excess
working capital for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $55,000), with the balance being held in reserve for tax payments
and in the event due diligence, taxes, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. In
addition to the foregoing, interest earned on the funds in the trust account of
up to $250,000 may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements if
we have not consummated a business combination by the one year anniversary of
the date of this prospectus. Such amount would be added to our excess working
capital. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the
funds available to us to pay to consultants to assist us with our search for a
target business. We could also use a portion of the funds available to us as a
down payment or to fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision (a provision in letters of
intent designed to keep target businesses from ‘‘shopping’’ around for
transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target
businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although
we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of
intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target
business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a
’’no-shop’’ provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific
business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our
forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could
result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, conducting
due diligence with respect to, or completing a business combination with, a
potential target business.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States ‘‘government
securities’’ so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

The allocation of net proceeds not held in trust represents our best estimate of
the intended uses of these funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be
inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described
categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the up to $360,000 fee payable
to EarlyBirdCapital, the representative of the underwriters, upon the
consummation of a business combination for acting as our investment banker on a
non-exclusive basis to assist us in structuring a business combination and
negotiating its terms (but not for purposes of locating potential target
candidates for our business combination). The funds used to pay the
representative will not be available to us to use in connection with or
following the business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used
in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, paying salaries, for strategic acquisitions and any related change
of control payments and for marketing, research and development of existing or
new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or
finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business
combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust fund were
insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of our formal liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the
trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Harry Edelson has contractually
agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such formal liquidation 
(currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have 
contractually agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. These liquidation 
costs do not include any amounts necessary to repay the debts and obligations 
owed to target businesses or vendors, which such amounts will be repaid from 
the remaining assets prior to our formal liquidation.

Harry Edelson has advanced to us a total of $125,000 which was used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for
SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and legal and audit fees and expenses. The
loan will be payable without interest on the earlier of September 1, 2007 or the
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering available to us.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts we can receive from the trust account)
to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination
is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

    •   the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include            
        acquisitions, capital expenditures and additions to working capital.       

We retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of such proceeds, since the
amounts that we will actually expend for working capital will vary significantly
depending on a number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, and
the amount of cash we generate from operations. Pending the uses of proceeds
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, interest-bearing investment grade securities.

The subordinated and general corporate debt to be reduced ($28.3 million)
consists of a subordinated debt credit facility owed to Deere Credit Inc., which
matures on October 1, 2009, accruing interest at a current rate of 10.2%, and a
general corporate credit facility owed to Deere Credit, maturing on October 1,
2009, accruing interest at a current rate of 8.3%. Of the $28.3 million we will
be paying down, during the twelve months ended February 28, 2007, we have
borrowed approximately $9.0 million under the general corporate credit facility
to fund a $3.0 million subordinated debt loan to FGDI, the $2.0 million
acquisition of New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) stock, $2.5 million used
for general corporate purposes, $0.5 million for a loan to Green Diesel LLC and
$1.0 million for an investment in Green Diesel, LLC. Also, during the twelve
months ended February 28, 2007, we have borrowed approximately $11.5 million
under the subordinated debt credit facility primarily to increase our FCM’s
regulatory capital."

US$45.4 million to pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions;
(3) approximately US$45.4 million to launch new developments; (4) approximately

initial public offering price of US$10.0 per ADS.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as follows:

      †   approximately US$40.0 million to enhance our marketing of Xianling Gubao 
          and other products;                                                      

      †   approximately US$10.0 million to strengthen our research and development 
          infrastructure and broaden and commercialize our product pipeline; and   

      †   the balance to fund working capital and for general corporate purposes,  
          which may include product licensing and strategic acquisitions of        
          businesses, business units or products that we believe could complement  
          our existing capabilities and business (although we are not currently    
          negotiating any such acquisition).                                       

We have not yet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and therefore
cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above.
The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, and competitiveness and growth rate of our
business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in
applying the net proceeds we receive from this offering. Depending on future
events and other changes in the business climate, we may determine at a later
time to use the net proceeds for different purposes. Pending their use, we
intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt
instruments or bank deposits.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders."

receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling

We expect to use a portion of our net proceeds to repay the entire outstanding
balance under our term loan and revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley
Bank, which was approximately $14.0 million as of December 31, 2006. This term
loan bears interest at the Federal Reserve’s prime rate plus 0.25%, which was
8.50% as of December 31, 2006, and this revolving credit facility bears interest
at the Federal Reserve’s prime rate, which was 8.25% as of December 31, 2006.
The term loan has a maturity date of August 18, 2009. The revolving credit
facility has a maturity date of August 18, 2008. We have used the proceeds of
the term loan and the revolving credit facility for working capital and other
general corporate purposes.

We intend to use the remaining net proceeds to us from this offering for working
capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. We may also
use a portion of our net proceeds to fund acquisitions of complementary
businesses, products or technologies. However, we do not have agreements or
commitments for any specific repayments or acquisitions at this time.

(1)   Excludes the payment of $100 from the representatives for their purchase
      option, proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and
      proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.

(2)   $300,000 of the gross proceeds from the sale of existing stockholders'
      warrants will be used to repay loans to us by members of management, which
      will be effected by a reduction in the purchase price paid by such
      executive officers for existing stockholders' warrants. A portion of the
      offering expenses have been paid from the funds received from these loans.

(3)   $133,850 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
      NASD registration fee, and approximately $95,000 of legal and auditing
      fees have been paid from the funds loaned to us by members of our
      management described below. The repayment of these loans will be effected
      by a reduction in the purchase price paid by such executive officers for
      existing stockholders' warrants.

(4)   Excludes a portion of the underwriting discount equal to 2.5% of the gross
      proceeds of this offering, or $2,160,000 (or $0.20 per unit), or
      $2,484,000 if the underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in
      full, payment of which is being deferred. In addition, the full amount of
      the non-accountable expense allowance payable to the representatives of
      the underwriters equal to 1% of the gross proceeds of this offering, or
      $864,000, is being deferred. These proceeds will be held in the trust
      account and will not be released until the earlier to occur of the
      completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation on the
      terms described in this prospectus.

(5)   This amount includes funds received from the proceeds of this offering,
      including the deferred expenses described in note (3) above.

(6)   This amount will be used for general working capital purposes.

      $84,242,000 (or $96,618,800 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full), or approximately $7.80 per unit (or $7.78 per unit if the
underwriters' over-allotment is exercised in full), which includes (i) the
portion of the underwriting discount and the full amount of the representatives'
non-accountable expense allowance being deferred, and (ii) the proceeds of
$2,700,000 from the private sale of existing stockholders' warrants
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering, but excludes offering
expenses of approximately $920,000 and an additional $50,000 to be used for
miscellaneous working capital purposes, will be placed in a trust account at
JPMorganChase NY Bank, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
acting as trustee, under an agreement to be signed on the date of this
prospectus. The underwriters have agreed to defer payment of a portion of the
underwriting discount equal to 2.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering, or
$2,160,000 (or $0.20 per unit), or $2,484,000 if the underwriter's
over-allotment option is exercised in full, and the full amount of the
representatives' non-accountable expense allowance, or $864,000. These proceeds
will be held in the trust account and will not be released until the earlier to
occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination on the terms
described in this prospectus, in which case such proceeds will be released to
the underwriters, and (2) our liquidation, in which case such proceeds will be
distributed to the public stockholders, together with all of the other funds
held in the trust account. Therefore, unless and until our initial business
combination is consummated, the proceeds held in the trust account will not be
available for our use for any expenses related to this offering, expenses that
we may incur related to the investigation and selection of a target business or
the negotiation of an agreement to effect our initial business combination.
However, up to an aggregate of $1,800,000 of the interest accrued on the amounts
held in the trust account (net of taxes, if any, payable by us with respect to
such interest) will be released to us in monthly installments to fund a portion
of our working capital requirements. We may use a portion of such interest to
pay taxes, if any, attributable to previously-accrued interest. Once an
aggregate of $1,800,000 is released to us, all of the interest earned on the
amounts held in the trust account (net of taxes payable) will remain in the
trust account until we consummate our initial business combination or liquidate.

      We believe that the deferment of payment of a portion of the underwriting
discount equal to 2.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering and the full
amount of the representatives' non-accountable expense allowance equal to 1% of
the gross proceeds of this offering and the placement of these amounts in the
trust account will benefit our stockholders because this will preserve more
money for possible distribution to the public stockholders in the event of
liquidation prior to our initial business combination or in the event less than
20% of our public stockholders (but not our existing stockholders) elect to
convert their shares of common stock in connection with our initial business
combination. The net proceeds of this offering held in the trust account will be
invested only in United States ""government securities"" within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180
days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed
to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

      The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination.
Upon the consummation of an initial business combination, the deferred portion
of the underwriting discount and the full amount of the representatives'
non-accountable expense allowance will be released to the representatives of the
underwriters out of the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account,
less approximately $7.80 (or $7.78 if the underwriters' over-allotment is
exercised in full) plus the excess accrued interest after the release of monthly
installments to fund our working capital requirements (net of taxes payable) for
each share of our common stock that our public stockholders (but not our
existing stockholders) elect to convert in connection with our initial business
combination. Neither of the representatives of the underwriters will be entitled
to any interest accrued on the deferred portion of the underwriting discount or
on the full amount of the representatives' non-accountable expense allowance.
The trust will pay taxes, if any, on the income, if any, earned by the proceeds
held in trust from the income on such proceeds. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business will be used as working
capital to finance operations of the target business.

      We anticipate that simultaneously with the consummation of this offering,
we will privately sell an aggregate of 2,700,000 warrants to our existing
stockholders and one of their affiliates, Transmedia Corporation, at a price of
$1.00 per warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,700,000. $300,000 of 
the gross proceeds from the sale of existing stockholders' warrants will be used to
repay loans to us by members of management, which will be effected by a
reduction in the purchase price paid by such executive officers for existing
stockholders' warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will
be placed in the trust account. The privately placed existing stockholders'
warrants will be identical to the warrants offered by this prospectus in many
respects, however the existing stockholders' warrants may be exercisable on a
cashless basis, so long as such warrants are held by our existing stockholders
or their affiliates, and the existing stockholders' warrants are not redeemable
by us. Furthermore, the purchasers of the existing stockholders' warrants,
including all of our executive officers, have agreed not to sell or transfer
their existing stockholders' warrants (or any of the underlying shares of common
stock) until 90 days after the consummation of our initial business combination.
The existing stockholders' warrants purchased by The Hearst Corporation and
Transmedia Corporation will be subject to the same terms and conditions as those
purchased by our officers and directors.

      Management, in its sole discretion, may purchase units in the offering.
However, they are not obligated to do so and we do not have any agreement with
them requiring them to purchase such securities.

      Our agreement with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company permits us
to utilize up to $1,800,000 of the interest earned upon monies in the trust
account for working capital. Such amount will be paid to us in monthly
installments commencing one month after completion of this offering. We believe
that such amount will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and that
the payment in monthly installments will not impede our ability to pursue our
business objectives. We intend to use the working capital for director and
officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $300,000) and general and
administrative services, including office space, utilities and secretarial
support, with the balance being held in reserve for other expenses, such as due
diligence, legal, accounting, and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations. We expect that due diligence of prospective target
businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers and directors and
may include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our
officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence
of prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities undertaken on our behalf. This arrangement is for our
benefit and is not intended to provide our full-time officers with compensation.
We believe that our working capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing
expenses and reimbursement costs.

      We may use a portion of the interest earned by the principal in the trust
account to make a deposit or fund a ""no-shop, standstill"" provision (a provision
in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from ""shopping"" around
for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target
businesses) with respect to a prospective business combination, although we do
not have any present intention to do so. We believe the net proceeds from the
offering will be sufficient to fund the evaluation, negotiation and other
expenses attendant to consummating a business combination even if we make such a
payment. However, in the event that we are required to forfeit such funds
(whether as a result of a breach of the agreement relating to such payment or
otherwise), we may not have sufficient working capital available to pay expenses
related to locating a suitable business combination without securing additional
financing. In such event, if we are unable to secure additional financing, we
may not consummate a business combination in the prescribed time period and we
will be forced to liquidate and dissolve.

      The payment to Transmedia Corporation, an affiliate of Harvey Seslowsky,
our President and Chief Operating Officer, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for
certain administrative, technology and secretarial services, as well as the use
of certain limited office space located in Dallas, Texas. This arrangement is
being agreed to by Transmedia Corporation for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Mr. Seslowsky compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the Dallas, Texas area, that the fee
charged by Transmedia Corporation is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination
or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee. Other
than the $7,500 per-month administrative fee, reimbursable out-of-pocket
expenses payable to our officers and directors, no compensation of any kind
(including finder's, consulting and similar fees) will be paid to any of our
existing stockholders, officers or directors or to any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, such individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, in identifying potential target businesses, performing
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations and travel
expenses. To the extent that such expenses exceed available working capital,
such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a
business combination, in which event this reimbursement obligation would in all
likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business. Although it is
our present intention to have our current officers and directors remain with us
following a business combination, the future role of our officers and directors
and their respective remuneration, if any, in the target business following a
business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Our current
officers and directors would only be able to remain with the company after the
consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment
or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such
negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the
business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive
compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services
they would render to the company after the consummation of the business
combination. While the personal and financial interests of such individuals may
influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, the
ability of such individuals to remain with the company after the consummation of
a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to
whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination, though
these considerations will be a factor in our decision, which poses potential
conflicts of interest. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and
directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations
of the particular target business.

      The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States ""government securities,"" or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The interest income derived from investment of these net
proceeds during this period may be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

      To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business.

      Messrs. Granath, Seslowsky, Clauser, and Maggin, representing all of our
executive officers, advanced to us a total of $100,000 on August 25, 2005, and
Transmedia Corporation, an affiliate of Mr. Seslowsky, advanced to us $20,000 on
September 3, 2005, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, American
Stock Exchange registration fee and legal and accounting fees and expenses.
Messrs. Granath, Clauser and Maggin advanced to us a total of $30,000 on
September 26, 2005 to pay additional expenses associated with this offering. On
March 28, 2006, Mr. Clauser advanced to us $15,000, and on April 3, 2006,
Messrs. Granath, Maggin and Transmedia Corporation advanced to us a total of
$35,000 to cover additional expenses associated with this offering, including
anticipated roadshow expenses. On November 17, 2006, Messrs. Granath, Seslowsky,
Clauser and Maggin advanced a total of $50,000 to us to cover additional
expenses related to this offering. Most recently, on February 16, 2007, Messrs.
Granath, Seslowsky, Clauser and Maggin advanced to us a total of $50,000 to
cover additional roadshow and other offering expenses. Accordingly, as of the
date of this prospectus, our executive officers and certain of their affiliates
have advanced to us a total of $300,000 to cover expenses related to this
offering. The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of one year
(eighteen months for the August 2005 and September 2005 notes) from the date the
loans were made to us or the consummation of this offering. On March 6, 2007,
the August 2005 notes were amended to extend their maturity date to July 25,
2007. The repayment of these loans will be effected by a reduction in the
purchase price paid by such executive officers for existing stockholders'
warrants.

      We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the funds available
to us outside of the trust account, together with the $1,800,000 aggregate
amount of interest accrued on the amounts held in the trust account (net of
taxes, if any, payable by us with respect to such interest) that will be
released to us in monthly installments to fund a portion of our working capital
requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 24
months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

      A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including a portion of interest earned on his, her or its portion of
the trust account) only in the event of our liquidation or if that public
stockholder (but not our existing stockholders) were to seek to convert such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account.

      In the event of our liquidation, our officers, directors and existing
stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only with
respect to any shares of common stock which they purchased in or following this
offering, and not with respect to any of their initial shares or warrants."

after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

•   approximately $50 million to repay certain outstanding indebtedness to our    
    parent and Xinhua Financial Network Limited. The indebtedness is due on demand
    and the interest rates are not specified. The indebtedness was to pay for the 
    costs related to our acquisitions from our parent of equity interests our     
    parent had held before March 31, 2006 in Xinhua Finance Advertising Limited   
    and the contractual control our parent had held before March 31, 2006 in      
    Beijing Century Media Culture Co., Ltd. as well as advances from our parent   
    and Xinhua Financial Network enabling us to acquire 19.0% equity interests in 
    Upper Step Holdings Limited, or Upper Step, and Accord Group Investments      
    Limited, or Accord Group;                                                     
   
•   an undetermined amount for strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses.
    At this time, we have not entered into advanced discussions or negotiations   
    with respect to any potential acquisitions except for the acquisition of the  
    remaining equity of Beijing Perspective; and                                  
   
•   the balance to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes. 

We have not yet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and therefore
cannot estimate the amounts to be used for acquisitions or general corporate
purposes. The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending on the
amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological
developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our
management will have significant discretion in the allocation of the net
proceeds we will receive for this offering. Depending on future events and other
changes in the business climate, we may determine at a later time to use the net
proceeds for different purposes. Pending their use, we intend to invest the
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation instruments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.

The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and allocate the net
proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business conditions.
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to
apply the net proceeds of this offering differently than as described in this
prospectus.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders."

approximately $71.8 million, based on the initial public offering price of
$15.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
other estimated expenses of $2.5 million payable by us. If the underwriters’
option to purchase additional shares in this offering is exercised in full we
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $83.8 million. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling
stockholders, one of which is our Chief Executive Officer. 
 
We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for working capital
and other general corporate purposes, including financing our growth, developing
new products and funding capital expenditures. We may seek to finance our growth
by, for example, expanding our direct sales force in international markets and
by hiring additional personnel beyond our current plans to bring products to
market sooner. Some possible capital expenditures include, without limitation,
(i) procuring and installing an enterprise resource planning system,
(ii) purchasing additional development and testing equipment for our security
lab and (iii) acquiring additional security-related technology for further
development. In addition, we may choose to repay the equipment line portion of
our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank or expand our current business
through acquisitions of other businesses, products or technologies. However, we
do not have agreements or commitments for any specific repayments nor do we have
any plans, proposals or arrangements with respect to any specific acquisitions
at this time. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance under the
equipment line portion of our Silicon Valley Bank credit facility was
$1,312,000, bearing interest at annual rates from 6.5%, fixed, to 8.75%,
variable based on prime plus 0.5% at December 31, 2006, and maturing between
February 2007 and December 2009. The outstanding balance, if any, under the
working capital portion of the credit facility must be repaid on March 28, 2007.
The proceeds of the equipment line portion of the credit facility were used for
furniture, leasehold improvements, personal computers and equipment for our
network security lab.
 
Pending any use, as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing investment grade securities."

(1)Approximately $82,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration
fee, the NASD filing fee and a portion of the non-accountable expense allowance
and legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we received from
Laurence S. Levy and Edward Levy described below. These funds will be repaid out
of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of
this offering.

(2)For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are reflected as the
amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of the offering. An
additional $1,350,000, or $1,552,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised
in full, all of which will be deposited in trust following the consummation of
the offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a
business combination.

(3)The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $200,000 even
if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, an aggregate of $1,550,000 of
interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be
available to us to pay for our working capital requirements and tax obligations.
For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the
total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Laurence S. Levy, our
chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Edward Levy, our president
and director, and Isaac Kier, one of our stockholders, have committed to
purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $1,500,000)
from us. These purchases will take place on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will not pay any
discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider warrants.
All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust
fund described below.

$85,250,000 or $98,210,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, of
net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,500,000 we will receive from the sale
of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Smith Barney, a
division of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes a
portion of the underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the
underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have agreed that such amount
will not be paid unless and until we consummate a business combination and have
waived their right to receive such payment upon our liquidation if we are unable
to complete a business combination. The funds held in trust will be invested
only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed
to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with
respect to $1,550,000 of interest income that may be released to us to fund our
working capital requirements and tax obligations, the proceeds held in trust
will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion
of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust
account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business
with which we complete a business combination.

The payment to ProChannel Management LLC, an affiliate of Laurence S. Levy, our
chairman of the board and chief executive officer, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by ProChannel
Management LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Levy
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the New York City metropolitan area, that the fee charged by
ProChannel Management LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained
from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of
a business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to
“Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the due diligence
investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business combination,” “Due
diligence of prospective target businesses” and “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, taxes and reserves.” Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $200,000. In addition, interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $1,550,000 will be released
to us to fund our working capital requirements, when and if such funds are
needed. We intend to use these funds for director and officer liability
insurance premiums (approximately $80,000), due diligence, taxes, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our
behalf as described above. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the
funds available to us to pay to consultants to assist us with our search for a
target business. We could also use a portion of the funds available to us as a
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent
designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with
other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect
to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any
current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid
for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that
would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be 
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount
of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a 
result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds
to continue searching for, conducting due diligence with respect to, or completing
a business combination with, a potential target business.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States “government
securities” so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

The allocation of net proceeds not held in trust represents our best estimate of
the intended uses of these funds. In the event that our assumptions prove to be
inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described
categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the up to $900,000 fee payable
to EarlyBirdCapital, the representative of the underwriters, upon the
consummation of a business combination for acting as our investment banker on a
non-exclusive basis to assist us in structuring a business combination and
negotiating its terms (but not for purposes of locating potential target
candidates for our business combination). The funds used to pay the
representative will not be available to us to use in connection with or
following the business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used
in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of
the trust fund were insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our initial stockholders have agreed to advance
us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be
no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

Laurence S. Levy, Edward Levy and Isaac Kier have advanced to us a total of
$125,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and
legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on
the earlier of September 1, 2007 or the consummation of this offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts we can receive from the trust account)
to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not
consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

shares of Class A common stock in this offering, assuming the initial public 
offering price of $25.00 per share and after deducting estimated underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the offering payable by us. 
If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will 
receive additional net proceeds of approximately $85 million after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions. 
  
The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, 
create a public market for our Class A common stock and facilitate future 
access to public equity markets. We expect to use the proceeds from this offering 
for market and network expansion, spectrum acquisitions and general corporate 
purposes.

Footnotes to this table appear after the following table.

        On March 5, 2007, we completed a private placement of warrants in the
aggregate amount of $3,750,000. After payment of the offering expenses and
repayment of the loan of $500,000 from a director and stockholder, Mr. Playford,
our operating expenses, including expenses incurred in identifying a target
business and the negotiation and consummation of our initial business
combination, will be paid from the remaining proceeds of the private placement.

        We intend to be prudent in the use of available cash with a view to
minimizing such use to the extent practicable prior to consummation of our
initial business combination. Assuming that we may need to use substantially all
of the remaining private placement proceeds to cover our expenses, including
expenses incurred in identifying a target business and the negotiation and
consummation of a business combination, we have allocated the maximum amount
available to us for operating expenses as follows:

Possible uses of funding:

______

(1)    Of the total $10,500,000 underwriting discounts and commissions (or       
       $12,075,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in   
       full), the underwriters will defer the amount of $6,000,000 (or           
       $6,900,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in    
       full) until the consummation of our initial business combination within   
       the time period and on the terms described in this prospectus. Such       
       deferred amount shall be deposited in the trust account. If such a        
       business combination does not occur, the underwriters will forfeit their  
       deferred discounts and commissions. 
                                      
(2)    Certain of these expenses have been paid prior to the closing of this     
       offering by us from the proceeds of a loan of $500,000 from a director and
       stockholder, Mr. Playford. Through December 31, 2006, we have incurred    
       deferred offering expenses of $443,224 and other expenses of $147,598,    
       consisting primarily of formation, registration, legal, accounting and    
       other administrative expenses and interest. As of January 8, 2007, we have
       paid $244,054 of such expenses. To the extent so paid, the proceeds from  
       the sale of the private placement warrants shall be used to repay, in     
       part, such loan. In turn, an equivalent amount of the proceeds from this  
       offering shall be used for the purposes for which such proceeds from the  
       sale of the private placement warrants would have been used. Since we have
       not made payments for any purpose other than payment of those expenses,   
       the unused balance of the proceeds from the loan, together with such use  
       of proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants, will be      
       sufficient to repay the principal of such loan. Interest payable on such  
       loan is included in “miscellaneous expenses and reserves” in the second   
       table above.                             
                                 
(3)    Miscellaneous expenses will include the reimbursement of our existing     
       stockholders for out-of-pocket expenses advanced on our behalf in         
       connection with this offering and other miscellaneous offering expenses.  
       To date, there are no advances to be reimbursed to our existing           
       stockholders for out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this offering. 

(4)    Includes market research and valuation firms, as well as other third-party 
       consultants, that we may engage. We intend to engage Kelley Drye & Warren  
       LLP, which is affiliated with one of our directors and existing            
       stockholders, Mr. Barker, to perform securities and corporate legal work   
       for us, including in connection with our initial business combination. We  
       intend to engage ILUT Srl, which is affiliated with one of our directors   
       and existing stockholders, Dr. Lepore, to perform consulting services in   
       connection with planning associated with the acquisition process,          
       identifying and evaluating potential target businesses and performing due  
       diligence. Dr. Lepore, our President, is the owner and former President of 
       ILUT Srl. Effective November 1, 2006, Dr. Lepore became a full-time        
       employee of ours and ceased being employed by ILUT Srl. Dr. Lepore has,    
       however, retained his ownership of ILUT Srl. There are no limitations that 
       restrict us from engaging Kelley Drye & Warren LLP or ILUT Srl, each of    
       which is affiliated with one or more of our directors, to perform such     
       services and other customary legal and consulting services for us for      
       customary fees and on customary terms and conditions and any such          
       engagement will be approved by a majority of our independent and           
       disinterested directors.                                                   

(5)    Includes airfare, transportation costs, lodging and                      
       meals and associated expenses.                           

(6)    Miscellaneous expenses and reserves includes the interest expense of       
       $17,136.99 on the $500,000 loan from a director and stockholder, Mr.       
       Playford, advanced to us out of the proceeds from the private placement of 
       warrants, our estimated costs and expenses for implementing and completing 
       a dissolution and distribution plan, if required, and certain relocation   
       expenses for our President, Dr. Lepore, incurred in connection with his    
       relocation from Milan, Italy to New York, NY, USA. Our directors, officers,
       existing stockholders and special advisor will receive reimbursement for   
       any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with  
       activities on our behalf, such as identifying target businesses and        
       performing due diligence in connection with possible business combinations.
       To the extent that our sources of funds (excluding proceeds deposited in   
       the trust account) are insufficient to pay such expenses in full, such     
       expenses will not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate our initial     
       business combination.                                                      

These are estimates only. We believe that $3,250,000 will be sufficient to fund
all of our expenses until we consummate our initial business combination within
the time period and on the terms described in this prospectus or, if we fail to
do so, until we complete our dissolution and liquidation as described in this
prospectus.

         Of the total proceeds of this offering, $143,700,000 of the proceeds of
this offering (or $7.66 per unit, including the deferred underwriters’ discount
and commissions of $6,000,000) or $165,525,000 (or $7.68 per unit, including the
deferred underwriters’ discount and commissions of $6,900,000) if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in a
trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The amount in the trust account will be
invested only in “government securities” within the meaning of, or money market
funds meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 promulgated under, the Investment
Company Act of 1940. By so restricting the investment of these amounts, we
intend to avoid being deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act.

If we consummate our initial business combination within the time and on the
terms described in this prospectus, the amount held in the trust account will be
used as follows:

•      payment of the conversion price to public stockholders who properly       
       exercise their conversion rights;                                         

•      payment of deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions; and

•      payment to us of the balance to finance consummation of our       
       initial business combination, finance operations of a target      
       business and other general corporate purposes (including any      
       related finders, legal, accounting, investment banking or         
       professional fees).                                               

         Any of our remaining assets would also be used for such financing and
corporate purposes.

If our initial business combination is approved and consummated, our public
stockholders voting against such combination will be entitled to convert their
shares of common stock. In order to be eligible to exercise their conversion
rights, a public stockholder must:

     •    vote against the initial business combination; and

     •    prior to or contemporaneously with their vote against such combination  
          affirmatively exercise their conversion right.                          

Public stockholders so entitled to exercise their conversion rights will be
entitled to convert their shares of common stock into cash at a conversion price
equal to a pro rata share of the amount held in the trust account as of the
close of business on the second business day prior to the consummation of our
initial business combination, including any interest earned on amounts held and
underwriting discounts and commissions deposited in the trust account (net of
taxes payable on such interest and the rights of creditors to funds held in the
trust account, if any). Public stockholders will not be entitled to convert
their shares by simply voting against the business combination; instead, each
public stockholder must also affirmatively exercise his conversion rights. Any
request for conversion may be withdrawn at any time up to the date of the
meeting of stockholders. Payment will be made to such stockholders promptly
following consummation of the business combination.

        If we fail to consummate our initial business combination and our
dissolution and liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we will adopt a
plan of distribution, as required under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, pursuant to which we shall:

     •    pay, or make such provision as we determine to be reasonable to pay, all
          claims, liabilities and obligations, including all contingent,          
          conditional or unmatured contractual claims, that are known to us;      

     •    make such provision as we determine to be reasonably likely to be       
          sufficient to pay any claim against us which is the subject of a pending
          action, suit or proceeding to which we are a party; and                 

     •    make such provision as we determine to be reasonably likely to be       
          sufficient to pay claims that have not been made known to us or that    
          have not arisen but that, based on facts known to us, we determine are  
          reasonably likely to arise or to become known to us within 10 years     
          after the date of dissolution.                                          

These liabilities and obligations include our expenses arising during our
remaining existence and the costs of our dissolution and liquidation. The costs
of our dissolution and liquidation are expected to consist of the preparation of
a plan of distribution, the approval of that plan and our dissolution by our
board of directors, the submission thereof to a vote by our stockholders
(including the preparation of the proxy statement, the engagement of proxy
solicitation firms and the conduct of our special meeting of stockholders), our
continuing public reporting obligations, including the services of our counsel
and independent public accounting firm, and the winding up of our affairs,
including legal fees we may incur in the event of disputes with any claimants or
creditors. We estimate that our total costs and expenses for implementing and
completing our dissolution and our plan of distribution will be in the range of
$75,000 to $100,000. We intend to manage our expenses to provide that there will
be sufficient funds available out of our remaining assets not held in trust to 
fund these expenses and our other liabilities and obligations.

        The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become
subject to the claims of our creditors and we could be required to pay our
creditors prior to making any distributions to the holders of common stock sold
in this offering. We will seek releases, waivers or similar agreements waiving
any right, interest or claim in or to any amounts held in the trust account
from:

     •    each vendor, service provider or other person who is owed money by us   
          for services rendered or products sold; and                             

     •    each target business with which we enter into a written letter of       
          intent, confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement or other written    
          agreement.                                                              

        We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such releases,
waivers or similar agreements or that they will be valid and enforceable.

        Our officers have agreed, however, that, upon our dissolution and
liquidation, they shall, jointly and severally, indemnify us for any claim by
any such vendor, service provider or other person or any such target business,
except with respect to claims made by a vendor, service provider or other person
or a target business that shall have signed such a release, waiver or similar
agreement, and that the amount of such indemnification shall be limited to the
amount by which such claim actually reduces the amount of funds held in the
trust account. However, our officers will not indemnify us for any claim for
which we obtain a release, waiver or similar agreement, even if such waiver,
release or similar agreement is held to be unenforceable. As a result, if any
such release, waiver or similar agreement is not valid and enforceable, the
claimant may be able to seek payment from the funds held in trust. If a current
officer ceases to be an officer of Symmetry for any reason, such officer’s
liability will extend solely to claims arising out of acts or omissions during
such person’s tenure as an officer of us. We cannot assure you that our current
officers will be able to satisfy such indemnification obligations and we have
not independently ascertained the financial ability of our officers to do so.

         After payment or making provision for payment under the plan of
distribution as described above, the amount held in the trust account and all of
our remaining assets will be paid on a pro rata basis to the holders of shares
of common stock included in the units offered by this prospectus up to 100% of
the gross proceeds of this offering as of the close of business two days prior
to the date of distribution. If we have distributed the amount equal to 100% of
the gross proceeds of this offering and paid all outstanding liabilities and
obligations and reserved for such funds as may be necessary under our plan of
distribution to provide for future claims reasonably expected to arise, the next
$3,750,000 of our assets not distributed to such holders will be paid to our
existing stockholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with their purchases of
the private placement warrants. Thereafter, any remaining additional assets will
be paid on a pro rata basis to the holders of shares of common stock included in
the units offered by this prospectus."

(1)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid, or will be paid, from    
     funds we received in the form of an interest-free $240,000 loan from        
     Churchill Capital Partners LLC, as described below. We have not included    
     this loan in the Use of Proceeds table because the amount of the loan is    
     reflected in total offering expenses.                                       
                                                                                 
(2)  The underwriter has agreed to defer $3.5 million of its underwriting        
     discount (or $3.85 million if the over-allotment option is exercised in     
     full), which equals 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering, until      
     consummation of a business combination. Upon consummation of a business     
     combination such deferred discount (subject to a $0.28 per share reduction  
     for public stockholders who vote against the business combination and       
     exercise their conversion rights) will be released to the underwriter out of
     the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account. The underwriter    
     will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred discount.      

(3)  We currently estimate that we would require approximately $50,000 to $75,000
     to implement our stockholder approved dissolution and plan of distribution  
     in the event we do not consummate a business combination.                   
                                                                                 
   We will place $100.0 million, or $109.65 million if the underwriter’s
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the net proceeds of this offering
and the private placement in a trust account maintained by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
NA, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until
the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our dissolution
(except for up to $1.35 million of the interest earned on the trust account
which may be released to us to cover a portion of the operating expenses and
except for interest earned on the trust account which may be used to pay income
taxes on such interest). We expect to use $3.5 million of proceeds held in the
trust account to pay the deferred underwriting discount (subject to a $0.28 per
share reduction for public stockholders who vote against the business
combination and exercise their conversion rights) (or $3.85 million if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full), and the remaining proceeds held in
the trust account as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with
which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration
to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the
target business, to effect other acquisitions or for other corporate purposes,
as determined by our board of directors at that time.

   We have agreed to pay to Churchill Capital Partners LLC, our principal
stockholder, a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and administrative services
including office space, utilities and administrative support. We will pay
Churchill Capital Partners LLC the $7,500 fee each month until the earlier of
(i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) our dissolution.
We believe that based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York,
New York metropolitan area that the fee charged by Churchill Capital Partners
LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated
person.

   We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our officers and directors and may include engaging
market research firms and/or third party consultants. Such market research firms
and/or third party consultants will be paid out of the funds allocated for due
diligence. Our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed
from the funds allocated for due diligence investigation for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities attendant to consummating a business transaction. To the
extent funds not held in the trust account are insufficient to reimburse
management for out-of-pocket expenses, the obligation to repay advances by
management may be assumed by the resulting entity following, and subject to, the
consummation of a business combination.

   Churchill Capital Partners LLC, our principal stockholder, has advanced to us
interest free, a total of $240,000, which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC
registration fee, NASD filing fee, American Stock Exchange filing fee and
accounting and legal fees and expenses. The loan is due on the consummation of
this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not
being placed in the trust account.

   We may use a portion of the proceeds not held in the trust account to make a
deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. The amount that would be used as a down payment or lock-up payment would
be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination. If we are
ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of
the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise) we will be forced to
dissolve and distribute our assets."

(1)   $171,514 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, NASD 
      filing fee, American Stock Exchange application fee and legal and accounting
      fees, have been paid from the $200,000 loan we received from Excel. Interest
      of 4% per annum accrued and unpaid on the loan as of February 28, 2007 was  
      $6,149, and will be paid from the proceeds of this offering not held in     
      trust.                                                                      

(2)   The amount of underwriting discount and the amount held in trust includes   
      $4,500,000 (or $5,175,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is    
      exercised in full) (in each case, less $0.24 for each share of our common   
      stock that our public shareholders elect to convert in connection with our  
      initial business combination) that will be paid to the underwriters only    
      upon consummation of the initial business combination and will not be       
      available for use to acquire an operating business. In the event that a     
      business combination is not consummated within the required time period,    
      that amount will be included in the liquidating distribution to our public  
      shareholders and Excel with respect to the 625,000 shares included in the   
      insider units on a pro rata basis.                                          

(3)   The miscellaneous fees and expenses may include, without limitation, finders
      fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation, potential deposits,    
      down payments or funding of a “no-shop” provision with respect to a         
      particular business combination), D&O insurance, trustee’s fees in the      
      amount of a $1,000 initial acceptance fee and $3,000 in annual transfer     
      fees, and dissolution obligations and reserves, if any. The miscellaneous   
      fees and expenses do not, however, include the $75,000 per year fee payable 
      to our independent directors, as such fees are payable only after we have   
      consummated our initial business combination.                               

We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or more
operating businesses in the shipping industry. We do not have any specific
merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase or other
similar business combination under consideration and have not contacted any
prospective target business or had any discussion, formal or otherwise, with
respect to such a transaction.

Of the proceeds from this offering and the private placement, $153,600,000, or
$175,200,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of
which $4,500,000 (or $5,175,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) is attributable to the deferred underwriters’ discounts and
commissions, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
Except for interest income released to us, net of income taxes, the proceeds
will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion
of a business combination or as part of any plan of dissolution and liquidation
approved by two-thirds of our shareholders, which would include liquidation of
our trust account. All amounts held in the trust account that are not converted
to cash or released to us as interest income, net of income taxes, will be
released on closing of our initial business combination with one or more target
businesses which have a fair market value of at least 80% of our net assets
(excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $4,500,000, or
$5,175,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, in
each cash less $0.24 for each share of our common stock that our public
shareholders elect to convert in connection with our initial business
combination) at the time of such business combination, subject to a majority of
our public shareholders voting in favor of the business combination and less
than 30% of the public shareholders voting against the business combination and
electing their conversion rights. The 30% threshold is 20% in most similar
entities. See “Risk Factors—Unlike most other blank check offerings, we allow up
to approximately 29.99% of our public shareholders to exercise their conversion
rights. The ability of a larger number of our shareholders to exercise their
conversion rights may not allow us to consummate the most desirable business
combination or optimize our capital structure.” Following release from the trust
account of interest income, net of income taxes, on the trust account balance
that we may use for working capital requirements and after payment of the
conversion price to any public shareholders who exercise their conversion
rights, the underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to
pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with
which our initial combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for
using stock or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the
trust account to general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the acquired business, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of vessels or other companies in the shipping
industry, or for working capital.

We have agreed to pay our corporate shareholder, Excel Maritime Carriers Ltd., a
monthly fee of $7,500 for general and administrative services, including office
space, utilities and secretarial support. We believe that, based on rents and
fees for similar services in the Athens, Greece, metropolitan area, the fee
charged by Excel is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated third party.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $1,170,000) for
premiums for director and officer liability insurance and for insurance for
third-party claims against the trust (approximately $300,000), with the balance
of $870,000 being held in reserve for other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our directors and officers in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We have also reserved approximately
$500,000 for reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with conducting 
due diligence reviews of prospective target businesses. We expect that due 
diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of 
our officers and directors and may include engaging market research and 
valuation firms, as well as other third party consultants. None of our officers 
or directors will receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, 
other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our 
behalf while performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. We have 
agreed with the underwriters that our audit committee will review and approve 
all expense reimbursements made to our officers, directors or existing 
shareholders and that any expense reimbursements payable to members of our 
audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with 
the interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. 
To the extent such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not 
deposited in the trust account and interest income, net of income taxes, of up 
to $2,000,000 that may be released to us from the trust account, such 
out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a 
business combination. In addition, we may opt to make a down payment or pay 
exclusivity or similar fees in connection with structuring and negotiating a 
business combination. We have not reserved any specific amounts for such 
payments or fees, which may have the effect of reducing the available proceeds 
not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses and 
reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf.

Excel has loaned to us a total of $200,000 for the payment of offering expenses.
This loan, including principal and simple interest accruing thereon at 4% per
annum, will be payable on the earlier of May 9, 2007 or the consummation of this
offering. The principal of this loan will be repaid out of the proceeds used to
pay the offering expenses and the interest will be paid out of the proceeds of
the offering not held in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering which are not held in the trust account and
not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only
in United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued
by the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Notwithstanding our belief that we are not
required to comply with the requirements of such act, in the event that the
shareholders do not approve a plan of dissolution and liquidation and the funds
remain in the trust account for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be
considered to be an investment company and, thus, required to comply with such
act.

According to the Federal Reserve Statistical Release dated February 26, 2007,
referencing historical interest rate data which appears on the Federal Reserve
website, U.S. Treasury Bills with four-week, three-month and six-month
maturities were yielding, as of the week ending February 23, 2007, 5.17%, 5.05%
and 4.97%, respectively. While we cannot assure you the balance of the trust
account will be invested to yield these rates, we believe such rates are
representative of those we may receive on the balance of the trust account.
Interest income, net of income taxes payable on such interest, of up to
$2,000,000 on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the trust
account to fund a portion of our working capital requirements. Following
consummation of this offering, we believe the funds available to us outside of
the trust account, together with interest income, net of income taxes on such
interest, of up to $2,000,000 on the balance of the trust account to be released
to us for working capital requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to
operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming a business combination is not
completed during that time.

No compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be
paid to any of our directors, officers or existing shareholders or any of their
affiliates, other than the payment of $7,500 per month to Excel Maritime
Carriers Ltd. in connection with the general and administrative services
arrangement for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
business combination. However, our directors, officers and existing shareholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as participating in the offering
process, identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on
suitable business combinations, except that our independent directors will be
entitled to receive $75,000 in cash per year, accruing pro rata from the start
of their service on our board of directors and payable only upon the successful
completion of a business combination. We have agreed with the underwriters 
that our audit committee will review and approve all expense reimbursements 
made to our officers, directors or existing shareholders and that any  expense 
reimbursements payable to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and 
approved by our board of directors, with the interested director or directors 
abstaining from such review and approval. Since the role of present management 
after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine 
what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or
in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in
the trust fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to
finance the operations of the target business.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable and interest amounts previously released to us from the trust
account) only in the event of liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination within the allotted time, as part of our plan of
dissolution and liquidation approved by our shareholders, or if that public
shareholder were to seek to convert such shares to cash by exercising conversion
rights in connection with a business combination which the public shareholder
voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account."

$45.4 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to advance our clinical
development program for clevudine into Phase 3 clinical trials. We currently
estimate that these clinical trials for clevudine will cost approximately $72.0
million, including the internal personnel costs associated with conducting these
trials, to progress the clinical program to the filing of a New Drug Application
with the FDA. Accordingly, we will need to raise additional capital through
public or private equity offerings or debt financings to complete these clinical
trials.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the status of our research and development efforts, the
timing and success of clinical trials, the timing of regulatory submissions, the
amount and timing of any milestone payments under our collaboration agreements
and the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short-term investments."

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from advances we received 
      from Messrs. Watson and Ledecky described below. These advances will be     
      repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon  
      consummation of this offering.                                              

(2)   These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
      of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein.              

(3)   The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain 
      constant at $100,000 even if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised. 
      In addition, $3,000,000 of interest income earned on the amounts held in the
      trust account will be available to us to pay for our working capital        
      requirements. For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us 
      is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately    
      following the offering.                                                     

(4)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these  
      items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may   
      incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in   
      connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based    
      upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not        
      anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than           
      fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
      fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
      category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.    

A total of $292.8 million (or approximately $336.1 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), of the net proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the sponsors’ warrants described in this prospectus,
including $9.6 million (or approximately $11.0 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bank with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. Except for a portion of
the interest income that may be released to us, the proceeds held in trust will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. All amounts held in the trust account
that are not converted to cash or released to us as interest income will be
released on closing of our initial business combination with one or more target
businesses which collectively have a fair market value of at least 80% of the
balance in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions of $9.6 million or approximately $11.0 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the time of such business
combination, subject to a majority of our public stockholders voting in favor of
the business combination and less than 20% of the public stockholders electing
their conversion rights and subject to such deferred underwriting discount and
commission having been paid to the underwriters. On release of funds from the
trust account and after payment of the conversion price to any public
stockholders who exercise their conversion rights, the underwriters will receive
their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, and the remaining funds
will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase
price of the business or businesses with which our initial combination occurs.
If the business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, we may
apply the cash released to us from the trust account to general corporate
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired
business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness
incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase
of other companies, or for working capital.

We have agreed to pay Ironbound Partners Fund LLC, an entity owned and
controlled by Jonathan J. Ledecky, our president and secretary, a total of
$7,500 per month for office space, administrative services and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to us by Ironbound Partners Fund LLC
for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Ledecky compensation in lieu
of a salary or other remuneration because it is anticipated that the expenses to
be paid by Ironbound Partners Fund LLC will approximate the monthly
reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of the members of our management team and may include engaging
market research firms and/or third party consultants. Members of our management
team, or their affiliates or associates, will not receive any compensation for
their due diligence of prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection
with such due diligence activities. Our audit committee will review and approve
all expense reimbursements made to any member of our management team and any
expense reimbursements payable to members of our audit committee will be
reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the interested director or
directors abstaining from such review and approval.

We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income of up
to $3.0 million earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us
subject to the tax holdback (as described in more detail below) will be
sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated.
This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken
only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary
agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our
estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a
business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may
be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of
which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us.

If we complete a business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
members of our management team prior to the business combination’s closing will
become an obligation of the post-combination business, assuming these
out-of-pocket expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing. These
expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would be
treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined
business. Members of our management team may, as part of any such combination,
negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the target
business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our management
team to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in a
conflict of interest.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of
the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, Messrs. Watson and Ledecky have advanced to
us a total of $175,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, NASD
registration fee, American Stock Exchange fee and accounting and legal fees and
expenses. These advances are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of January 12, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Interest income of up to
$3.0 million on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the trust
account to fund a portion of our working capital requirements, subject to the
tax holdback.

Other than the fee for office space and administrative and secretarial services
described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) will be paid to members of our management team, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, members of our management
team will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them
in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential
target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust account and interest income of up to $3.0 million that is
released to us from the trust account (subject to the tax holdback), such
out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us prior to our consummation
of a business combination. In the event a business combination is consummated 
by us and irrespective of whether such persons remain associated with us, our 
audit committee and/or our board of directors may determine to reimburse such 
persons for such expenses. There is no limit on the amount of such expenses 
reimbursable by us to such persons. A public stockholder will be entitled to 
receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned on his, her 
or its portion of the trust account, net of taxes payable with respect to 
such interest, and less interest income released to us from the trust account 
in the manner described above) only in the event of our liquidation if we 
fail to complete a business combination within the allotted time or if the 
public stockholder seeks to convert such shares into cash in connection with 
a business combination that the public stockholder voted against and that we 
actually complete. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have 
any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust account.

On completion of an initial business combination, the underwriters will receive
the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust account.
If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee must
therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation, the
underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interest
thereon, in the trust account, and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to
distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with
any accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, to
the public stockholders on a pro rata basis."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
    NASD filing fee, blue sky fees, directors and officers insurance premium, and
    approximately $156,000 of legal and accounting fees, have been paid from the 
    funds we received from our executive officers described below. To date, we 
    have used all of the monies loaned to us by our executive officers. These 
    funds will be repaid only upon consummation of a business combination or 
    earlier solely from interest earned on the trust account this offering.                                                          

(2) The underwriters have agreed to deposit 4.0% of the gross proceeds           
    attributable to the underwriters’ discount into the trust account until the  
    earlier of the consummation of a business combination or the liquidation of  
    the trust account. They have also agreed to forfeit any rights to, or claims 
    against, such proceeds, including any interest thereon (net of taxes         
    payable), unless we successfully consummate a business combination.          

(3) Consists of a $500,000 revolving credit agreement to be made available to us 
    at closing by our officers and directors, which amounts are payable only upon
    consummation of a business combination or earlier solely from interest earned
    on the trust account. Does not include $348,791 of loans made prior to this  
    offering.                                                                    

(4) Assumes that we take down the credit line made available to us by management 
    in full.                                                                     

(5) Consists of the $500,000 revolving credit agreement to be made available to  
    us at closing by our officers and directors and the $348,791 in loans made to
    us by our management prior to this offering, which amounts are payable only  
    upon consummation of a business combination or earlier solely from interest  
    earned on the trust account.                                                 

(6) Assuming an interest rate 4.0% per annum on $205,000 and 5.5% per annum on   
    $643,791, and assuming that the principal amount of the loans remain         
    outstanding for six months.                                                  

(7) If we do not complete a business combination, we estimate that our total     
    costs and expenses for implementing and completing our stockholder-approved  
    plan of dissolution and distribution will be in the range of $50,000 to      
    $75,000.                                                                     

Upon completion of this offering and the private placement, $55,690,000, or
$63,838,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of
net proceeds will be placed in a trust account for our benefit at JPMorgan Chase
NY Bank maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, as trustee. Additionally, $2,340,000, ($2,691,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount will be deposited in the trust account for an aggregate
amount of $58,030,000 (or $66,529,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full). The underwriters have agreed that such amounts will be
distributed to the public stockholders as part of any plan of dissolution and
distribution approved by our stockholders which would include liquidation of our
trust account. The proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. Other than up to $1,500,000 of the interest income that may be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements and repay management
loans, the proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any funds held in
the trust account for the benefit of the underwriters) may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business (other than amounts held in the trust account for
the benefit of the underwriters, amounts paid for finders’ or professional fees
or amounts paid for any fees or costs incurred in connection with any debt or
equity financing made in connection with the business combination) may be used
to finance operations of the target business. We do not currently have any
agreement with any party with respect to the payment of finders’ or professional
fees. If we agree to pay such fees in the future, such fees shall be negotiated
on an arms-length basis.

We have estimated the costs related to the acquisition of a target business will
be approximately $600,000; approximately $300,000 to identify and research
prospective target businesses and approximately $300,000 for costs related to
the business combination, including legal and accounting expenses to structure
the transaction, prepare the transaction documents and file the related proxy
statement. Only $300,000 of the funds available outside the trust have been
allocated for such purposes and we intend to fund the balance, as well as
amounts that may exceed our current estimates and reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection
with activities on our behalf as described below, from a portion of the interest
earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account. We have agreed with
Rodman & Renshaw, LLC that the interest earned on the trust account (net of
taxes payable) up to a maximum of $1,500,000 will be released to us to fund our
working capital requirements and repay up to $848,791 of management loans. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by
some or all of our officers and directors and may include engaging market
research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will
not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working capital
to make a deposit, down payment or fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision with respect to
a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. If we did, the amount that would be used as a down payment
or to fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision would be determined based on the terms of the
specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time.
In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as
a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise),
we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital available outside of the
trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to finding
another suitable business combination without securing additional financing.
Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we would most likely
fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and would be
forced to liquidate.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

As of the date of this prospectus, our officers and directors have advanced to
us a total of $348,791, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC and NASD registration fees,
legal fees and other offering-related expenses, $205,000 of which loans bear
interest at 4% annually and $143,791 of which bear interest at 5.5% annually.
Additionally, our officers and directors have agreed to enter into a revolving
credit agreement with us in the amount of $500,000 at closing. Any advances
under the revolving credit agreement will be payable with 5.5% annual interest
upon the consummation of a business combination, subject to earlier repayment
solely to the extent of interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes
payable).

The net proceeds of this offering and the deferred underwriters’ discount held
in the trust account and the proceeds of the management working capital loans
not immediately required for the purposes set forth above, will be invested only
in United States ‘‘government securities,’’ defined as any Treasury Bills issued
by the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of
this offering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed to be an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the
requirements of such act, in the event that the stockholders do not approve a
plan of dissolution and distribution and the funds remain in the trust account
for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment
company and thus required to comply with such act. The interest income derived
from investment of these net proceeds not held in the trust account (net of
taxes payable) will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses,
as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

Assuming that $1,500,000 of interest earned on the trust account is released to
us, we believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds, together with funds available under the $500,000 revolving
credit agreement that management will provide us upon closing, to operate for at
least the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not
consummated during that time.

Except for the administrative services fee, no compensation of any kind
(including any finder’s and/or consulting fees) will be paid to any of our
existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us,
prior to or in connection with, the consummation of the business combination.
However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that such expenses
exceed the available funds not deposited in the trust account, such
out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a
business combination. These reimbursements may be paid from the $50,000
initially allocated for due diligence. There are no current agreements or
understandings with any of our existing stockholders or any of their respective
affiliates with respect to the payment of compensation of any kind subsequent to
a business combination. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest, net of taxes payable and interest previously released to
us, earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the event of
the liquidation of our trust account as part of our plan of dissolution and
distribution approved by our stockholders upon our failure to complete a
business combination within the allotted time, or if that public stockholder
were to seek to redeem such shares for cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
    NASD filing fee, blue sky fees, directors and officers insurance premium, and
    approximately $156,000 of legal and accounting fees, have been paid from the 
    funds we received from our executive officers described below. To date, we 
    have used all of the monies loaned to us by our executive officers. These 
    funds will be repaid only upon consummation of a business combination or 
    earlier solely from interest earned on the trust account this offering.                                                          

(2) The underwriters have agreed to deposit 4.0% of the gross proceeds           
    attributable to the underwriters’ discount into the trust account until the  
    earlier of the consummation of a business combination or the liquidation of  
    the trust account. They have also agreed to forfeit any rights to, or claims 
    against, such proceeds, including any interest thereon (net of taxes         
    payable), unless we successfully consummate a business combination.          

(3) Consists of a $500,000 revolving credit agreement to be made available to us 
    at closing by our officers and directors, which amounts are payable only upon
    consummation of a business combination or earlier solely from interest earned
    on the trust account. Does not include $348,791 of loans made prior to this  
    offering.                                                                    

(4) Assumes that we take down the credit line made available to us by management 
    in full.                                                                     

(5) Consists of the $500,000 revolving credit agreement to be made available to  
    us at closing by our officers and directors and the $348,791 in loans made to
    us by our management prior to this offering, which amounts are payable only  
    upon consummation of a business combination or earlier solely from interest  
    earned on the trust account.                                                 

(6) Assuming an interest rate 4.0% per annum on $205,000 and 5.5% per annum on   
    $643,791, and assuming that the principal amount of the loans remain         
    outstanding for six months.                                                  

(7) If we do not complete a business combination, we estimate that our total     
    costs and expenses for implementing and completing our stockholder-approved  
    plan of dissolution and distribution will be in the range of $50,000 to      
    $75,000.                                                                     

Upon completion of this offering and the private placement, $55,690,000, or
$63,838,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of
net proceeds will be placed in a trust account for our benefit at JPMorgan Chase
NY Bank maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, as trustee. Additionally, $2,340,000, ($2,691,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount will be deposited in the trust account for an aggregate
amount of $58,030,000 (or $66,529,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full). The underwriters have agreed that such amounts will be
distributed to the public stockholders as part of any plan of dissolution and
distribution approved by our stockholders which would include liquidation of our
trust account. The proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. Other than up to $1,500,000 of the interest income that may be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements and repay management
loans, the proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any funds held in
the trust account for the benefit of the underwriters) may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business (other than amounts held in the trust account for
the benefit of the underwriters, amounts paid for finders’ or professional fees
or amounts paid for any fees or costs incurred in connection with any debt or
equity financing made in connection with the business combination) may be used
to finance operations of the target business. We do not currently have any
agreement with any party with respect to the payment of finders’ or professional
fees. If we agree to pay such fees in the future, such fees shall be negotiated
on an arms-length basis.

We have estimated the costs related to the acquisition of a target business will
be approximately $600,000; approximately $300,000 to identify and research
prospective target businesses and approximately $300,000 for costs related to
the business combination, including legal and accounting expenses to structure
the transaction, prepare the transaction documents and file the related proxy
statement. Only $300,000 of the funds available outside the trust have been
allocated for such purposes and we intend to fund the balance, as well as
amounts that may exceed our current estimates and reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection
with activities on our behalf as described below, from a portion of the interest
earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account. We have agreed with
Rodman & Renshaw, LLC that the interest earned on the trust account (net of
taxes payable) up to a maximum of $1,500,000 will be released to us to fund our
working capital requirements and repay up to $848,791 of management loans. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by
some or all of our officers and directors and may include engaging market
research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will
not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working capital
to make a deposit, down payment or fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision with respect to
a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. If we did, the amount that would be used as a down payment
or to fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision would be determined based on the terms of the
specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time.
In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as
a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise),
we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital available outside of the
trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to finding
another suitable business combination without securing additional financing.
Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we would most likely
fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and would be
forced to liquidate.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

As of the date of this prospectus, our officers and directors have advanced to
us a total of $348,791, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC and NASD registration fees,
legal fees and other offering-related expenses, $205,000 of which loans bear
interest at 4% annually and $143,791 of which bear interest at 5.5% annually.
Additionally, our officers and directors have agreed to enter into a revolving
credit agreement with us in the amount of $500,000 at closing. Any advances
under the revolving credit agreement will be payable with 5.5% annual interest
upon the consummation of a business combination, subject to earlier repayment
solely to the extent of interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes
payable).

The net proceeds of this offering and the deferred underwriters’ discount held
in the trust account and the proceeds of the management working capital loans
not immediately required for the purposes set forth above, will be invested only
in United States ‘‘government securities,’’ defined as any Treasury Bills issued
by the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of
this offering to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed to be an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the
requirements of such act, in the event that the stockholders do not approve a
plan of dissolution and distribution and the funds remain in the trust account
for an indeterminable amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment
company and thus required to comply with such act. The interest income derived
from investment of these net proceeds not held in the trust account (net of
taxes payable) will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses,
as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

Assuming that $1,500,000 of interest earned on the trust account is released to
us, we believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds, together with funds available under the $500,000 revolving
credit agreement that management will provide us upon closing, to operate for at
least the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not
consummated during that time.

Except for the administrative services fee, no compensation of any kind
(including any finder’s and/or consulting fees) will be paid to any of our
existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us,
prior to or in connection with, the consummation of the business combination.
However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that such expenses
exceed the available funds not deposited in the trust account, such
out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a
business combination. These reimbursements may be paid from the $50,000
initially allocated for due diligence. There are no current agreements or
understandings with any of our existing stockholders or any of their respective
affiliates with respect to the payment of compensation of any kind subsequent to
a business combination. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest, net of taxes payable and interest previously released to
us, earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the event of
the liquidation of our trust account as part of our plan of dissolution and
distribution approved by our stockholders upon our failure to complete a
business combination within the allotted time, or if that public stockholder
were to seek to redeem such shares for cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

approximately U.S.$57.7 million in this offering after deducting underwriting

is the price per ADS set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Pursuant to the
terms of our restructured debt, we are required to use 25% of our net cash
proceeds from this offering to repurchase these debt instruments in the open
market for two years following the consummation of this offering, provided that
we will have no obligation to purchase these debt instruments at a price greater
than their face value.  We intend to use a portion of the estimated net proceeds 
to satisfy our commitment to repurchase our restructured debt in accordance 
with the terms of this debt, and the balance for general corporate purposes, 
including, if practicable, further repurchases of our restructured debt 
instruments and capital expenditures. We will not receive any proceeds from

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, based on
the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs payable by
us.
 
The principal purposes for this offering are to fund clinical development of our
product candidates, Contrave and Empatic, to fund working capital and other
general corporate purposes, to create a public market for our common stock and
to increase our ability to access the capital markets in the future.
 
We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:
 
      •    approximately $55.0 million to fund clinical trials for Contrave and 
           Empatic and other research and development activities; and           
     
      •    the remainder to fund working capital and other general corporate

We anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the borrowing
capacity under our $17.0 million credit and security agreement with Merrill
Lynch Capital, will allow us to initiate all of our planned Phase III clinical
trials for Contrave and complete our first Phase IIb clinical trial for Empatic.
 
We may also use a portion of the net proceeds set aside for our general
corporate purposes to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary businesses
or products. However, we have no current understandings, commitments or
agreements to do so.
 
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress in, and costs of, our clinical trials and other
product development programs. We therefore cannot estimate the amount of net
proceeds to be used for all of the purposes described above. We may find it
necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will
have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

generated by operations. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion to

We intend to use the net proceeds that we will receive to repurchase a portion

credit facility was $1,114.4 million in term loans and there were no amounts
outstanding under the revolving credit line as of the date hereof. The term loan
matures on October 5, 2013 and the revolving credit line matures on October 5,
2012, except that, under certain circumstances, both would mature on August 1,
2012. Our effective interest rate on the term loan was 7.4% as of December 31,
2006. The net proceeds of the term loan were used to finance a portion of the
purchase price for the Century acquisition, repay in full the loans outstanding
under our former senior secured credit facility, repay certain existing
indebtedness of Century and to pay for related fees and expenses. The revolving
credit line is used for our general corporate purposes. As of the date hereof,
we had outstanding approximately $535.6 million aggregate principal amount at
maturity of our 93/4% senior discount notes. Our 93/4% senior discount notes
mature in 2014.
 
Lehman Brothers Inc. acted as initial purchaser in connection with the offering

(1) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares of common  
    stock outstanding after the stock offering which could occur due to an       
    increase in the maximum of the independent valuation as a result of          
    regulatory considerations, demand for the shares, or changes in market       
    conditions or general economic conditions following the commencement of the  
    stock offering.                                                              

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the stock offering
may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase
if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not
purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering. Payments for
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result
in the receipt of new funds for investment but will result in a reduction of
Third Federal Savings and Loan’s deposits. In all instances, Third Federal
Savings and Loan will receive at least 50% of the net proceeds of the stock
offering.

We are undertaking the stock offering at this time in order to increase our
capital and have the capital resources available to expand our business. The 
stock offering proceeds will increase our capital resources and the amount of 
funds available to us for lending and investment purposes. The proceeds will 
also give us greater flexibility to expand our branch network and expand the 
products and services we offer to our customers.

TFS Financial Corporation may use the proceeds it retains from the stock
offering:

  •   to finance the purchase of shares of common stock in the stock offering by
      the employee stock ownership plan;                                        

  •   to invest in securities;

  •   to deposit funds in Third Federal Savings and Loan;

  •   to repurchase its shares of common stock;

  •   to pay dividends to our shareholders;

  •   to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches and other   
      financial services businesses, although no material transactions are being
      considered at this time; and                                              

  •   for general corporate purposes.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the stock offering,
except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory
approval. The loan that will be used to fund the purchases by the employee stock
ownership plan will accrue interest.

Third Federal Savings and Loan intends to contribute $5.0 million in cash to the
Third Federal Foundation, and invest the remaining proceeds it receives from the
stock offering initially in short-term, liquid investments. Over time, Third
Federal Savings and Loan may use the proceeds that it receives from the stock
offering as follows:

  •   to expand its retail banking franchise by establishing de novo branches,  
      by acquiring existing branches, or by acquiring other financial           
      institutions or other financial services companies, although no material  
      acquisitions or branch expansion are specifically being considered at this
      time;                                                                     

  •   to fund new loans;

  •   to support new products and services;

  •   to invest in securities; and

  •   for general corporate purposes.

The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on changes in interest
rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial services
industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall
market conditions. We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to our
performance in recent years until we are able to utilize effectively the
additional capital raised in the stock offering. Until we can increase our net
interest income and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity to
remain below the industry average, which may negatively affect the value of our
common stock."

will receive from the sale of shares of common stock until the stock offering is
completed, based upon the sale of our shares at $10.00 per share, we anticipate
that the net proceeds will be between $636.8 million and $862.8 million, or
$992.8 million if the stock offering is increased.

(1) As adjusted to give effect to an increase in the number of shares of common  
    stock outstanding after the stock offering which could occur due to an       
    increase in the maximum of the independent valuation as a result of          
    regulatory considerations, demand for the shares, or changes in market       
    conditions or general economic conditions following the commencement of the  
    stock offering.                                                              

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the stock offering
may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase
if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not
purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering. Payments for
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result
in the receipt of new funds for investment but will result in a reduction of
Third Federal Savings and Loan’s deposits. In all instances, Third Federal
Savings and Loan will receive at least 50% of the net proceeds of the stock
offering.

We are undertaking the stock offering at this time in order to increase our
capital and have the capital resources available to expand our business. The 
stock offering proceeds will increase our capital resources and the amount of 
funds available to us for lending and investment purposes. The proceeds will 
also give us greater flexibility to expand our branch network and expand the 
products and services we offer to our customers.

TFS Financial Corporation may use the proceeds it retains from the stock
offering:

  •   to finance the purchase of shares of common stock in the stock offering by
      the employee stock ownership plan;                                        

  •   to invest in securities;

  •   to deposit funds in Third Federal Savings and Loan;

  •   to repurchase its shares of common stock;

  •   to pay dividends to our shareholders;

  •   to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches and other   
      financial services businesses, although no material transactions are being
      considered at this time; and                                              

  •   for general corporate purposes.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the stock offering,
except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory
approval. The loan that will be used to fund the purchases by the employee stock
ownership plan will accrue interest.

Third Federal Savings and Loan intends to contribute $5.0 million in cash to the
Third Federal Foundation, and invest the remaining proceeds it receives from the
stock offering initially in short-term, liquid investments. Over time, Third
Federal Savings and Loan may use the proceeds that it receives from the stock
offering as follows:

  •   to expand its retail banking franchise by establishing de novo branches,  
      by acquiring existing branches, or by acquiring other financial           
      institutions or other financial services companies, although no material  
      acquisitions or branch expansion are specifically being considered at this
      time;                                                                     

  •   to fund new loans;

  •   to support new products and services;

  •   to invest in securities; and

  •   for general corporate purposes.

The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on changes in interest
rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial services
industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall
market conditions. We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to our
performance in recent years until we are able to utilize effectively the
additional capital raised in the stock offering. Until we can increase our net
interest income and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity to
remain below the industry average, which may negatively affect the value of our
common stock."

——————

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from loan proceeds ($118,000)
received from Ronen Zadok, our chief financial officer, secretary and a
director, as described below. These funds will be repaid out of the net proceeds
of this offering not being placed in the trust account upon consummation of this
offering.

(2) The 1% non-accountable expense allowance payable to Maxim Group LLC is not
payable with respect to the units sold upon exercise of the underwriters’
over-allotment option.

(3) Represents $750,000 (or $862,500 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is
exercised in full) of the underwriters’ discount, which Maxim Group LLC has
agreed to deposit into the trust account and forfeit if we do not consummate a
business combination.

(4) As indicated, the above table is an estimate of the use of the net proceeds of
the offering and private placement. The “Miscellaneous” line item is intended to
cover any accounting, legal, printing or other ancillary costs associated with
the offering and private placement which are more costly than estimated.

(5) We expect the estimated amount of the net interest earned on the trust account
that may be released to us to cover our operating expenses will be $1,500,000.

(6) In the event the over-allotment option is exercised in full, to the extent the
funds in trust are less than $9.91 per share, the first $114,900 in interest
earned on the amount held in the trust account (net of taxes payable) will be
used to cover such shortfall to bring the amount held in trust for the benefit
of the public stockholders to an aggregate of $28,480,900 ($9.91 per share).

$24,766,000, or $28,366,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of the proceeds of the offering and the private placement
will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers, Inc. maintained by
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. In the event the
over-allotment option is exercised in full, to the extent the funds in the trust
account are less than $9.91 per share, the first $114,900 in interest earned on
the amount held in the trust account (net of taxes payable) will be used to
cover such shortfall to bring the amount held in the trust account for the
benefit of the public stockholders to an aggregate of $28,480,900 ($9.91 per
share). Of the amount held in the trust account, up to $750,000 ($862,500 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to Maxim
Group LLC as deferred fees in connection with this offering, if and only if a
business combination is consummated, leaving us with $24,066,000 with which to
consummate a business combination. Other than interest income which may be
released to us as described in the table above, the proceeds held in trust will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our dissolution and liquidation to our public
stockholders of our trust account as part of our stockholder-approved plan of
dissolution and liquidation, net of any taxes paid or payable. The proceeds held
in the trust account (exclusive of any funds held for the benefit of the
underwriters or used to pay public stockholders who have exercised their
redemption rights) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination or, if there
is insufficient funds not held in trust, to pay other expenses relating to such
transaction such as reimbursement to insiders for out-of-pocket expenses, third
party due diligence expenses or potential finders fees, in each case only upon
the consummation of a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, as determined
by our board of directors at that time.

We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $7,500 to New Pole Ltd., an affiliate of
Ronen Zadok (our chief financial officer, secretary and a director), for general
and administrative services, including but not limited to receptionist,
secretarial and general office services. This agreement commences on the date of
this prospectus and shall continue until the earliest to occur of: (i) the
consummation of a business combination, (ii) failure to effect a business
combination within 18 months after consummation of this offering (or 24 months
after the completion of this offering if a letter of intent, agreement in
principle or a definitive agreement has been executed within 18 months after the
completion of this offering and the business combination relating thereto has
not yet been completed within such 18-month period) and (iii) the date on which
we determine to dissolve and liquidate our trust account as part of our plan of
dissolution and liquidation.

Prior to the closing of a business combination, we have agreed to obtain key man
life insurance in the amount of $2,000,000 on the lives of Adiv Baruch, our
president, chief executive officer and a director, and Ronen Zadok, our chief
financial officer, secretary and a director for a three year period. The premium
for such life insurance policies, of which we will be the sole beneficiary, will
be funded from the interest earned on the proceeds held in the trust account.

We have estimated the costs to identify and research prospective target
businesses and the costs related to the business combination, including legal
and accounting expenses to structure the transaction, prepare the transaction
documents and file the related proxy statement, will be approximately $400,000.
We intend to fund such costs from up to $1,500,000 of the interest earned on the
proceeds being held in the trust account, less interest earned on the trust
account held back in the trust account to ensure a $9.91 per share liquidation
price to public stockholders (if applicable). Although the rate of interest to 
be earned on the trust account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust 
account, and although we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will 
take to complete a business combination, we anticipate the interest that will 
accrue on the trust account, even at an interest rate of 4% per annum (which 
would generate approximately $2,000,000 of interest on the trust account during 
the 24 month period following the completion of the offering provided the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised), will be sufficient to 
identify a target, complete an acquisition and to fund our working capital 
requirements. While we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this 
rate, we believe such rate is representative of that which we may receive.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of our officers and directors, and may include engaging market
research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will
not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds and a portion of the interest
earned on the funds in the trust account which is released to us allocated to
working capital for director and officer liability insurance premiums. We intend
to fund our working capital needs as well as amounts that may exceed our current
estimates, from the interest earned on the proceeds being held in the trust
account (less any interest amounts held in trust to cover any shortfalls if the
overallotment option is exercised in full), with the balance being held for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. Up
to $1,500,000 of interest earned on the trust account in excess of the amount
necessary to have a $9.91 per share liquidation price to the public stockholders
will be released to us to fund our working capital and costs associated with our
stockholder-approved plan of dissolution and liquidation including reserves, if
any, if we do not consummate a business combination. Interest will be payable to
public stockholders redeeming in connection with a business combination pro
rata, net of amounts previously released to us and taxes payable.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of such working capital to make
a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit
such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such
payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital
available outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other
expenses related to finding another suitable business combination without
securing additional financing. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the
allotted time and would be forced to dissolve and liquidate as part of our
stockholder-approved plan of dissolution and liquidation.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is
less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event, the
proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be released to us and used to finance the operations of the target
businesses, which may include subsequent acquisitions.

As of the date of this prospectus, Ronen Zadok, our chief financial officer,
secretary and a director, has loaned us a total of $118,000, which was used to
pay a portion of the expenses of this offering, such as SEC registration fees,
NASD registration fees, blue sky fees and certain legal and accounting fees and
expenses. These loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of
September 30, 2007 or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be
repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

In seeking a business combination, we intend to utilize cash derived from the
proceeds of this offering and the private placement, as well as our capital
stock or debt, or a combination of cash, capital stock and debt, and there is no
limit on the issuance of capital stock or incurrence of debt we may undertake in
effecting a business combination. In the event a business combination is
consummated, all sums remaining in the trust account will be released to us
immediately thereafter, and there will be no restriction on our use of such
funds.

The net proceeds of this offering and the private placement not held in the
trust account and not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will
be invested only in United States “government securities,” defined as any
Treasury Bill issued by the United States having a maturity of one hundred and
eighty days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

By restricting the investment of the proceeds of this offering and the private
placement to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed an investment
company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. Notwithstanding our
belief that we are not required to comply with the requirements of such act, in
the event that the stockholders do not approve a plan of dissolution and
liquidation and the funds remain in the trust account for an indeterminable
amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment company and thus
required to comply with such act. As disclosed in the table above, the interest
income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be
used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, and all costs associated with the consummation of
a business combination, until a business combination is completed. We believe
that, upon consummation of this offering and the private placement, and with the
interest income generated by the funds held in trust, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month general and administrative service
fees described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and
consulting fees) will be paid by us or any person or entity to any of our
existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination.
However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. After the consummation of a
business combination, if any, to the extent our management remains as officers
of the resulting business, we anticipate that they may enter into employment or
consulting agreements, the terms of which shall be negotiated and which we
expect to be comparable to employment or consulting agreements with other
similarly-situated companies in the industry in which we consummate a business
combination. Further, after the consummation of a business combination, if any,
to the extent our directors remain as directors of the resulting business, we
anticipate that they will receive compensation comparable to directors at other
similarly-situated companies in the technology industry.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, if
any, less the amount of taxes paid or payable, if any, on interest earned but
previously released to us) only in the event of our dissolution and the
liquidation of our trust account to our public stockholders as part of our plan
of dissolution and liquidation approved by our stockholders upon our failure to
complete a business combination. If that public stockholder were to seek to
redeem such shares for cash in connection with a business combination which the
public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate, such public
stockholder would be entitled to receive $9.91 per share plus interest, net of
taxes payable and interest released to us. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account. The term public stockholders means the holders of common stock sold as
part of the units in this offering or acquired in the open market, but excludes
all of our officers and directors with respect to the shares owned by them prior
to this offering, since they have waived their redemption rights to any
liquidation amounts with respect to these shares upon our dissolution."

after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
aggregate offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for the
following purposes: 

        •   approximately $52.0 million to fund our research and development efforts  
            as follows;                                                               

        •    approximately $35.0 million to fund joint pre-clinical studies and    
             clinical trials in China with international pharmaceutical and        
             biotechnology companies to develop innovative pharmaceuticals for the 
             China market. In particular, we plan to spend approximately $5.0      
             million to fund the joint research and development of an anti-cancer  
             pharmaceutical with Advenchen Laboratories LLC, or Advenchen, a       
             pharmaceutical research and development company in the United States, 
             based on a chemical compound owned by Advenchen. While we are in      
             active discussions with several other international pharmaceutical and
             biotechnology companies regarding potential research and development  
             projects, no other specific project has been identified, nor have we  
             entered into any other definitive agreement for any other project. We 
             anticipate that these proceeds will allow us to fund such research and
             development efforts for at least the next 24 months. If additional    
             funding is needed, we plan to use cash generated from operating       
             activities to fund such need;                                         

        •    approximately $13.0 million to fund the research and development of   
             potential indications for Endu, the Phase IV clinical trials for Endu,
             and the improvement of delivery mechanisms or dosage formulations for 
             Endu. We anticipate that these proceeds together with our existing    
             cash will allow us to perform Phase IV clinical trials for Endu for at
             least the next 24 months; and                                         

     •   approximately $4.0 million to purchase research equipment;

     •   approximately $30.0 million to repay certain of our outstanding short-term
         bank borrowings;                                                          

     •   approximately $14.0 million to fund our GMP-certified production          
         facilities, including approximately $9.0 million to build additional      
         GMP-certified production facilities and purchase additional production    
         equipment to expand our production capacity of Endu, and approximately    
         $5.0 million to revamp our existing production facilities and to purchase 
         additional equipment to maintain compliance with GMP requirements; and    

     •   approximately $13.0 million to expand our marketing force and strengthen  
         our marketing efforts, including initiating additional promotional and    
         educational campaigns targeting healthcare practitioners, pharmacies,     
         patients and the general public to increase awareness of our products and 
         to increase the use of print and television advertisements and other      
         promotional methods to promote our brand names.

We may also use the remaining portion of the net proceeds we receive from this
offering for other general corporate purposes and for potential acquisitions of,
or investments in, products, product candidates, businesses and technologies
that we believe will complement our current operations and our expansion
strategies. We do not have specific plans and are not currently engaged in any
discussions or negotiations for any acquisitions.

The foregoing use of our net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. The amounts and
timing of any expenditure will vary depending on the amount of cash generated by
our operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of
growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have
significant discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds we will receive
from this offering. Depending on future events and other changes in the business
climate, we may determine at a later time to use the net proceeds for different
purposes. Pending their use, we intend to place our net proceeds in short-term
bank deposits.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we
are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to other entities
only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiaries or make additional capital contributions to our PRC
subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders."

(1)   Excludes the payment of $100 from the underwriters for its purchase option,  
      proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and proceeds from  
      the exercise of any warrants.                                                
   
(2)   A portion of the offering expenses has been paid from the funds we received  
      from our Chairman as described below. These funds will be repaid without     
      interest out of the proceeds of this offering.                               
   
(3)   The underwriters have agreed to deposit the non-accountable expense allowance
      equal to 2.75% of the gross proceeds of this offering ($0.165 per Unit) and a
      portion of the underwriting discount equal to 1.25% of the gross proceeds of 
      this offering ($0.075 per Unit) into the trust account until the earlier of  
      the completion of a business combination or the liquidation of the trust     
      account. Upon the consummation of a business combination, we will pay 
      such deferred non-accountable expense allowance and the deferred 
      portion of the underwriting discount to the underwriters out of the 
      proceeds of this offering held in trust, less the pro rata portion of    
      such deferred non-accountable expense allowance and the deferred portion of  
      the underwriting discount payable to stockholders that vote against the      
      business combination and elect to convert their shares of common stock to    
      cash. The underwriters have further agreed to forfeit any rights to or claims
      against such proceeds unless we complete a business combination.             
   
(4)   Includes the private placement proceeds of $1,500,000 as well as $1,402,500  
      which represents the underwriters’ non-accountable expense allowance and     
      $637,500 (or $733,125 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full)     
      which represents the deferred portion of the underwriting discount which is  
      further described in footnote 3.                                             
   
(5)   We may use a maximum of $1,200,000 of the interest earned from monies in the 
      trust account to fund the expenses reflected in the table. At closing, the   
      Chairman will loan the Company $150,000. The loan, which will bear interest  
      at 4%, will be repaid from the interest earned from the funds held in trust. 
      The loan is separate from the $150,000 loan made by our Chairman prior to    
      this offering which will be repaid without interest from offering proceeds.  
   
(6)   The $200,000 is expected to be paid to legal, accounting and other outside   
      professionals to conduct due diligence once a potential target for a business
      combination is identified and to assist in negotiating and structuring the   
      ultimate business transaction. The $300,000 represents costs expected to be  
      incurred by the Company and its officers, directors and employees in         
      identifying and reviewing potential targets for business combinations, some  
      portion of which may represent reimbursement to third parties.               
 
We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units and the private
placement warrants to acquire one or more operating businesses with operations
primarily in China. $50,042,500, or $57,443,875 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering and
the private placement will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers Inc.
maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Upon
consummation of a business combination, $2,040,000, or $2,135,625 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be paid to the
underwriters from the trust in respect of the deferred underwriters’
non-accountable expense allowance and the deferred portion of the underwriting
discount. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target businesses, other than
amounts paid to the underwriters for their non-accountable expense allowance,
amounts paid for finders’ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or
costs incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made in
connection with the business combination. The Company does not currently have
any agreement with any party with respect to the payment of finders’ or
professional fees. If the Company agrees to pay such fees in the future, such
fees shall be negotiated on an arms-length basis. While it is difficult to
determine what the specific operating expenses of a target business may entail,
we expect that they may include some or all of the following: capital
expenditures, expenditures for future projects, general ongoing expenses
including supplies and payroll, expanding markets and strategic acquisitions or
alliances.
 
We have agreed to pay NCIL, an affiliate of Alwin Tan, a monthly fee of $5,000
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Mr. Tan, the General Partner of NCIL our Chief Executive Officer and
President, with compensation in lieu of salary. We believe, based on rents and
fees for similar services in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, that the fee
charged by NCIL is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated third party. However, because our directors may not be deemed
“independent”, we did not have the benefit of disinterested directors approving
the transaction.
 
We are entitled to use up to $1,200,000 of interest, net of taxes, for working
capital which includes repayment of the loan from our Chairman, director and
officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve for
other expenses such as, travel to China, due diligence, legal, accounting, and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations, and
deposits, down payments and/or funding of a “no shop” provision in connection
with a business combination as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities 
on our behalf as described below. We believe that the working capital will be
sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.
 
We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is
less than the proceeds in trust or because we financed a portion of the
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event, the
proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended, will be used to finance the operations of the target businesses, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.
 
Our Chairman has loaned a total of $150,000 to us for the payment of offering
expenses. Upon the consummation of this offering, the loan will be repaid
without interest and the Chairman will loan an additional $150,000 to us which
will be deposited into our operating account, will bear interest at a rate of
4% per year and will be payable out of the interest earned on the trust account
on the earlier of the first anniversary of the consummation of this offering or
the consummation of a business combination.
 
The net proceeds of this offering, including the private placement proceeds and
the deferred underwriters’ non-accountable expense allowance and the deferred
portion of the underwriting discount held in the trust account, that are not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The interest income derived from investment of
the net proceeds not held in trust during this period will be used to defray our
general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.
 
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.
 
We intend to allocate a portion of the working capital for expenses incurred in
examining and evaluating prospective target businesses. Alwin Tan will supervise
this process and we expect that he will devote substantially all of his time to
our business once we have signed a term sheet with a target business. We
anticipate that Mr. Tan will be assisted in his efforts by the officers and
advisors of the Company, together with the Company’s outside attorneys,
accountants and other representatives. Other than the monthly fee to NCIL, we
will not pay compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees)
to the Company’s directors, officers, employees, stockholders or special
advisors or their respective affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or
in connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, our
existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. These reimbursements may be paid from the $300,000
allocated for due diligence. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination. However, other than the agreement with NCIL described above, there
are no current agreements or understandings with any of our existing
stockholders or any of their respective affiliates with respect to the payment
of compensation of any kind subsequent to a business combination.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account net
of working capital (up to a maximum of $1,200,000) and taxes payable.) only in
the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination
or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such shares into cash in
connection with a business combination which the public stockholder voted
against and which we actually consummate. The amount a public stockholder would
be entitled to receive could be reduced as a result of any potential claims of
creditors against us which are senior to the claims of our public stockholders.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
non-accountable expense allowance and the deferred portion of the underwriting
discount held in trust and any accrued interest thereon, less the pro rata
portion of such amount payable to stockholders that vote against the business 
combination and elect to convert their shares of common stock to cash. In the 
event that we are unable to consummate a business combination and the trustee 
is forced to liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed to the 
following: (i) forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and any remaining 
accrued interest thereon; and (ii) that the proceeds attributable to the 
underwriters’ non-accountable expense allowance and the deferred portion of 
the underwriting discount will be distributed on a pro rata basis among the 
public shareholders along with any remaining accrued interest thereon. In 
addition, the $1,500,000 from the proceeds of the private placement of the 
warrants also will be distributed pro rata among the public shareholders in 
the event of such liquidation."

underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering, will be
approximately $119.4 million. We will not receive any of the proceeds from any
sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds of $119.4 million from this offering to:
 
     •  repay, together with approximately $44.0 million of the proceeds from our
        senior secured term loan held in a segregated account, $111.1 million of 
        outstanding borrowings under our senior secured term loan, including     
        prepayment premium;                                                      
    
     •  repay approximately $7.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our     
        senior secured credit facility;                                          
    
     •  retain approximately $17.3 million for future capital expenditures,      
        including progress payments relating to the construction of the Superior 
        Achiever and the upgrade and refurbishment of the Gulf Diver IV; and     
    
     •  pay a special cash dividend of $28.0 million to our existing stockholders
        prior to the completion of this offering.                              
 
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.
 
As of March 31, 2007, our existing indebtedness consisted of borrowings of
$110.0 million in aggregate principal amount under our senior secured term loan
that is scheduled to mature in 2012 and borrowings of $7.0 million in aggregate
principal amount under our senior secured credit facility that is scheduled to
mature in February 2010. We used approximately $28.2 million of the proceeds
from the senior secured term loan to repay our existing indebtedness.
Approximately $44.0 million of the proceeds from the senior secured term loan is
held in a segregated account and will be used, together with a portion of the
proceeds from this offering, to repay in full the senior secured term loan upon
the completion of this offering. As of March 31, 2007, the interest rate on our
outstanding indebtedness under the senior secured term loan was approximately
8.82%, and the interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness under the senior
secured credit facility was approximately 8.25%."

initial public offering price of $23.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated transaction fees and
expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common
stock by the selling stockholders.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds to us primarily to build-out our network and
launch our services in certain of our recently acquired Auction 66 Markets, with
a primary focus on the New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Las Vegas metropolitan
areas, as well as for general corporate purposes. Our management will have broad
discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. The amounts
actually expended and the timing of such expenditures will depend on a number of
factors, including our realization of the different elements of our growth
strategy and the amount of cash generated by our operations.
 
Until such time as we have identified specific uses for the net proceeds of this
offering and have spent such funds, we will invest the net proceeds in
short-term, investment grade securities."

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received 
      in the form of a loan from MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P. as described below. 
      This loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not placed in  
      the trust account and used to cover certain of the offering expenses set     
      forth above.                                                                 
   
(2)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these   
      items may differ substantially from those set forth herein.                  
   
(3)   Excludes deferred underwriting discounts and commissions equal to 3.5% of the
      gross proceeds from the sale of the units to the public stockholders, or     
      $5,250,000 ($6,037,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is         
      exercised in full), which will be deposited in the trust account and which   
      the underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our initial  
      business combination. If we complete a business combination, $5,250,000 (or  
      $6,037,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)  
      will be paid to the underwriters as deferred discounts and compensation      
      (subject to a $0.28 per share reduction for public stockholders who exercise 
      their conversion rights).                                                
   
(4)   These expenses include any reimbursements to be made to our officers and     
      directors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in performing due      
      diligence and activities in connection with the evaluation of a potential    
      business acquisition, which reimbursement may include up to $750 per person  
      per flight that may be paid to MBF Healthcare Management, an entity owned by 
      Mike Fernandez, as well as any potential fees that we may pay to third       
      parties, such as market research firms and other consultants, that perform   
      due diligence of a target business on our behalf (other than to the extent   
      such fees are paid by our officers and directors on our behalf and such      
      persons are reimbursed in the amount and to the extent of such fees).        
   
(5)   The not yet identified miscellaneous expenses include, without limitation,   
      the reimbursement of our directors and officers for out-of-pocket expenses in
      connection with this offering, such as roadshow expenses and advances for    
      offering costs made by them and not covered by the amounts set aside for     
      offering expenses set forth on the table above.                              
 
We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units in this offering and
the sale of the securities in the private placement to acquire one or more
operating businesses in the healthcare industry.
 
Of the net proceeds after offering expenses of this offering and the private
placement, $149,250,000, or $170,962,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase
& Co., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as
trustee. Except for payment of taxes, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our liquidation. We expect to use the proceeds held in the trust account to
acquire one or more domestic or foreign operating businesses in the healthcare
industry. Interest earned on the trust account, after payment of taxes payable
in connection therewith, will be held in the trust account for use in completing
a business combination or released to investors upon exercise of their
conversion rights or upon liquidation, as the case may be. However, we may not
use all of the funds remaining in the trust account in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In
that event, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any
other net proceeds not expended, will constitute working capital for our
business after the business combination. While it is difficult to determine what
the specific operating expenses of our business after completion of a business
combination may be, we expect that they may include some or all of the
following: capital expenditures, general ongoing expenses including overhead and
payroll, costs involved in expanding markets and in developing strategic
acquisitions or alliances. In addition, we may use any remaining proceeds held
in the trust account to satisfy any unpaid reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our officers and directors, as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or
similar fees or compensation to the extent such expenses, fees, or compensation
exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account. If we complete
a business combination, $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters as
deferred discounts and compensation, as set forth herein (subject to a $0.28 per
share reduction for public stockholders who exercise their conversion rights).
The 30% conversion threshold is 20% in most similar blank check companies. 
 
The remaining $1,800,000 of net proceeds of this offering and the private
placement not held in the trust account may be used to fund our operations up to
the next 24 months, as described below.
 
We have reserved $350,000 for legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to
the structuring and negotiation of a business combination, $445,000 for expenses
related to due diligence and investigation of prospective target businesses, and
$80,000 for legal and accounting fees relating to SEC reporting obligations. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by
some or all of our officers, and directors and may include engaging market
research and valuation firms as well as other third-party consultants. None of
our officers or directors will receive any compensation for any due diligence
efforts, other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur
on our behalf while performing due diligence of prospective target businesses,
which reimbursement may include up to $750 per person per flight that may be
paid to MBF Healthcare Management, an entity owned by Mike Fernandez, for costs
arising from our officers’ and directors use of its corporate jet in connection
with activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating targets for
our initial business combination. Any reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
would occur at our discretion. To the extent such out-of-pocket expenses exceed
the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such out-of-pocket
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless and until we complete a business
combination.
 
We have agreed to pay MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P. a monthly fee of $7,500 for
general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. We believe that, based on rents and fees for similar
services in Miami, Florida, the fees charged by MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P.
and MBF Healthcare Management are at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from unaffiliated third-parties.
 
We have reserved approximately $400,000 for premiums for director and officer
insurance for a 24-month period. In addition, we have reserved approximately
$155,000 for the payment of corporate franchise taxes. We intend to use the
excess working capital (approximately $190,000) for other expenses incurred in
structuring and negotiating a business combination. For example, we may opt to
make a deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection
with structuring and negotiating our initial business combination. While we do
not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that
specialize in business acquisitions, we may do so in the future to assist us in
locating suitable acquisition candidates, in which event we may pay a finder’s
fee, or other compensation. We have not reserved any specific amounts for a
deposit, down payment, exclusivity fees, finder’s fees or similar fees or
compensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the available net
proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses
and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf. To the
extent that any such fees or compensation exceeds the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust account, we would not be able to pay such fees or
compensation unless we complete a business combination. In addition, the excess
working capital will be used to cover miscellaneous expenses that we have not
yet identified, which may include, without limitation, the reimbursement of our
officers and directors for out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this
offering, such as roadshow expenses and advances for offering costs made by them
and not covered by the amounts set aside for offering expenses described above.
 
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering and the private placement,
we will have sufficient available funds to operate at least for the next
24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that
time. The amount of available proceeds is based on management’s estimate of the
amount needed to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to complete a
business combination. Those estimates may prove inaccurate, especially if a
portion of the available proceeds is used to make a deposit or down payment or
pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business combination or if
we expend a significant portion of the available proceeds in pursuit of a
business combination that is not consummated.

In addition, the report of Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public
accounting firm, contains a going concern qualification. If we do not have
sufficient proceeds available to cover our expenses we may be forced to obtain
additional financing, either from our management, MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P.,
or third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional financing, and none of
our management, including our directors, nor MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P. is
obligated to provide any additional financing. If we do not have sufficient
proceeds not held in the trust account and cannot find additional financing, we
may be forced to liquidate prior to completing a business combination.
 
MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P. has agreed to loan up to a total of $400,000 to
us, in the form of a non-revolving line of credit, for the payment of offering
expenses. The loan bears interest at a rate of 5% per year and will be paid upon
the consummation of this offering out of the proceeds used to pay the offering
expenses. The loan from MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P. is due at the earlier of
June 12, 2007 or the closing of this offering. The unpaid principal balance
under the line of credit as of December 31, 2006 was $240,000.
 
The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be held in the trust account and invested only in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or securities issued or
guaranteed by the United States so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The interest income derived
from investment of the net proceeds not held in the trust account during this
period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well
as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.
 
Other than (i) the repayment of the $400,000 loan described above, (ii) the
payment of $7,500 per month to MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P. in connection with
the general and administrative services arrangement for services rendered to us,
and (iii) reimbursement to MBF Healthcare Management for costs arising from our
officers’ and directors’ use of its corporate jet, no compensation of any kind,
including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid to any of our officers,
directors, or existing stockholder or any of their respective affiliates prior
to or in connection with the business combination. However, our officers and
directors will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as participating in the
offering process, identifying potential target businesses, and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on its portion of the trust account, net of taxes
payable on the interest income of the funds in the trust account) only in the
event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination or
if that public stockholder were to seek to convert shares into cash in
connection with our initial business combination that the public stockholder
previously voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."
"UNITED STATES NATURAL GAS FUND, LP",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/united-states-natural-gas-fund-lp-722796-51851,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/united-states-natural-gas-fund-lp-722796-51851,424B3,4/17/2007,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=5106378,"The General Partner will initially invest all of USNG’s assets in Futures
Contracts and other Natural Gas-Related Investments Treasuries, cash and cash
equivalents. The General Partner has sole authority to determine the percentage
of assets that will be:

† held on deposit with the futures commission merchant or other custodian,

† used for other investments, and

† held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

The General Partner expects to deposit substantially all of USNG’s net assets
with UBS Securities or other custodian for trading. When USNG purchases a
Futures Contract and certain exchange traded Other Natural Gas-Related
Investments, USNG is required to deposit with the selling futures commission
merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or
other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under natural
gas interests at maturity. This deposit is known as “margin.” USNG will invest
the remainder of its assets equal to the difference between the margin deposited
and the face value of the Futures Contract in Treasuries.

The General Partner expects that all entities that will hold or trade USNG’s
assets will be based in the United States and will be subject to United States
regulations.

The General Partner believes that 5% to 10% of USNG’s assets will normally be
committed as margin for commodity futures contracts. However, from time to time,
the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less,
than such range. The General Partner intends to invest the balance of USNG’s
assets not invested in natural gas interests or held in margin as reserves to be
available for changes in margin. All interest income will be used for USNG’s
benefit.

The futures commission merchant, a government agency or a commodity exchange
could increase margins applicable to USNG to hold trading positions at any time.
Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit
or loss potential for any positions taken.

USNG’s assets will be held in segregation pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act
and CFTC regulations."

offering will be approximately $86.1 million, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We plan to use these net proceeds to finance the capital requirements of our
current and future VPC contracts, to finance research and development, to repay
indebtedness, to fund any cash consideration for future acquisitions and for
other general corporate purposes. We are not currently engaged in any
negotiations for acquisitions. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares by the selling stockholders if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option.

The indebtedness that we may repay consists of borrowings under our loan and
security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. Borrowings under our loan and
security agreement currently bear interest at either prime plus 2.0% or prime
plus 2.75% per annum depending on our performance under a financial covenant
contained in the agreement. This agreement was entered into in April 2003 and
has been used as a revolving line of credit."

------
1)   The underwriters have agreed to defer a portion of their underwriting
     discount, equal to 3% of the gross proceeds of the public portion of this
     offering, until the consummation of a business combination. Upon the
     consummation of a business combination, such deferred discount shall be
     released to the underwriters out of the gross proceeds of this offering
     held in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase, maintained by American Stock          
     Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. The underwriters will not be
     entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred discount.

(2)  Working capital for the company consists of the amount of net proceeds to
     the company not held in the trust account ($100,000) and up to $1,600,000
     of the interest earned on the trust account which may be released to us.

(3)  $8.00 per unit or $7.96 per unit if the over-allotment option is exercised.

    Of the proceeds of this offering, $92,300,000 or $106,250,000 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full, plus $4,700,000 from the private
placement of warrants, (accordingly, an aggregate of $97,000,000 or
$110,950,000, respectively) will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase,
maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. Additionally, $3,000,000 or $3,450,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount will be deposited into the trust account. The funds held
in trust will be invested only in United States ""government securities"" within
the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a
maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the consummation of a business combination or our dissolution and
liquidation. All amounts held in the trust account that are not converted to
cash or released to us as interest income, net of income taxes, will be released
on closing of our initial business combination with a target acquisition having
a fair market value of at least 80% of our net assets (excluding the amount held
in the trust account representing a portion of the underwriter's discount) at
the time of such business combination, subject to a majority of our public
stockholders voting in favor of the business combination and less than 30% of
the public stockholders voting against the business combination and electing
their conversion rights. The 30% threshold is 20% in most similar entities. See
""Risk Factors—Unlike most other blank check offerings, we allow up to
approximately 29.99% of our public stockholders to exercise their conversion
rights. The ability of a larger number of our stockholders to exercise their
conversion rights may not allow us to consummate the most desirable business
combination or optimize our capital structure."" If we are required to dissolve,
we will pay for the costs of dissolution from our remaining assets outside the
trust account. Prior to consummation of this offering, Gordon A. McMillan, our
Chairman of the Board, Andrew A. McKay, our Chief Executive Officer, and
JovFunds will each enter into a binding agreement to pay, jointly and severally,
the costs of dissolution and liquidation, which we currently estimate to be
approximately $50,000 to $75,000, to the extent they exceed our remaining assets
outside of the trust account. While we will seek waivers from all target
acquisitions, vendors and service providers to claims to amounts in the trust
account, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain any such waiver or
that any such waiver will be held valid and enforceable. Prior to consummation
of this offering, Gordon A. McMillan, our Chairman of the Board, Andrew A.
McKay, our Chief Executive Officer, and JovFunds, will each enter into a binding
agreement such that, if we dissolve and/or liquidate prior to a business
combination, they will be jointly and severally liable to ensure that the
proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of vendors for
services rendered or products sold to us, as well as claims of prospective
target businesses for fees and expenses of third parties that we agree in
writing to pay in the event we do not consummate a combination with such
business. However, we cannot assure you that will be able to satisfy those
obligations. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target acquisition with which we consummate a business
combination (excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a
portion of the underwriters' discount). Any amounts not paid as consideration to
the sellers of the target business will be used to finance our operations, 
which may include the target business(es) we acquired on the consummation of 
the business combination, to consummate other acquisitions, or for working 
capital, as determined by our board of directors at that time.

    We have agreed to pay Parkwood Holdings Ltd., a company that is wholly owned
by Gordon A. McMillan, Andrew A. McKay and JovFunds (or an affiliate of Parkwood
Holdings Ltd.), a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and administrative services
including office space, utilities and administrative support. This arrangement
is being agreed to by Parkwood Holdings Ltd. or its affiliate for our benefit
and is not intended to provide Messrs. McMillan and McKay or JovFunds
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on fees for similar services
in the Toronto, Ontario metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Parkwood
Holdings Ltd. or its affiliate is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
consummation of our business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public stockholders.

    Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account and from
interest earned on the trust account that may be released to us for our search
for a business combination will consist of $1,700,000. We intend to use this
amount for tax payments, due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating a business combination, as well as a possible down
payment, lock-up or ""no-shop"" provision (a provision in letters of intent
designed to keep target acquisitions from ""shopping"" around for transactions
with other companies on terms more favorable to such target acquisitions). Prior
to consummation of this offering, Messrs. McMillan and McKay and JovFunds will
agree, jointly and severally, to pay, on our company's behalf, any expenses in
excess of this $1,700,000 that we may incur in connection with our pursuit of a
business combination. Such payments will be reimbursed upon consummation of our
initial business combination. If necessary, the $1,700,000 would also be used to
bear the costs of liquidation and/or dissolution if in the event we are unable
to consummate a business combination within 18 months after the consummation of
this offering or execute a letter of intent, agreement in principle or
definitive agreement within 18 months after the consummation of this offering,
or if our corporate existence should cease 24 months from the consummation of
this offering. While we do not have any current intention to use these funds as
a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter of intent
where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition,
the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision
would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and
the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds
(whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, potential target acquisitions. In addition to the use of funds
described above, we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to
consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition. We believe
that this amount will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses. This
arrangement is for our benefit and is not intended to provide our private
stockholders or special advisors with any other compensation prior to the
consummation of our initial business combination.

    To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or
in part as consideration to consummate a business combination, the proceeds held
in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination
will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net
proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance our operations.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In
such event, the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net
proceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations, which may include
the target business(es) that we acquire in the business combination, to
consummate other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our
board of directors at that time.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
""government securities"" or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we
are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period that is
not otherwise returned to public stockholders who vote against a business
combination along with up to $1,600,000 of interest from the trust account
available to us will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses,
as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
consummated.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation
of a business combination, we will pay Parkwood Holdings Ltd. (or an affiliate
of Parkwood Holdings Ltd.) the administrative services fee described above.
Other than this $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finders, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid by us to any of our
officers, directors or private stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior
to, or for any services that they render in order to consummate, or in
connection with the consummation of a business combination, provided, however,
that, although no agreement or arrangement is currently in place or
contemplated, Genuity Financial Group or its subsidiaries (affiliated with our
director Robert Penteliuk) may be entitled to a fee in connection with our
initial business combination. Our officers, directors and private stockholders
will receive reimbursement, without limit but subject to board approval, for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target acquisitions, performing business
due diligence on suitable target acquisitions and business combinations, as well
as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target acquisitions to examine their operations.

    A public stockholder (but not our private stockholders with respect to any
shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering) will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned
on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the event of our
dissolution and subsequent liquidation of the trust account pursuant to the
trust agreement or if that public stockholder (but not our private stockholders
with respect to any shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before
this offering) converts such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination that the public stockholder voted against and that we consummate. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive a portion of the proceeds attributable to the underwriters'
discount held in the trust account. In the event that we are unable to
consummate a business combination and the trustee is forced to dissolve and/or
liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed that: (i) they will
forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon;
and (ii) the proceeds attributable to the underwriters' discount will be
distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public stockholders along with any
accrued interest thereon."

6,750,000 shares of our common stock being sold in this offering of
approximately $47.7 million or $55.2 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, based on the initial public offering price of
$8.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
other estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholder.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for capital expenditures
for the purchase of equipment and for leasehold improvements in connection with
our expansion and working capital for general corporate purposes, including
expansion of our marketing and sales departments. We may also use a portion of
the proceeds for the future acquisition of, or investment in, businesses,
products or technologies that complement our business, although we are not
pursuing any acquisitions or investments as of the date of this prospectus. We
have not allocated specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes,
and in the event of changes in our business or market conditions, we may
otherwise direct the proceeds from this offering to other corporate purposes.
 
We have not determined the amounts we plan to spend on certain of the items
listed above or the timing of these expenditures. As a result, our management
will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive
from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of these proceeds of this offering. Pending
these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing
obligations, investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States. The goal with respect to the
investment of these net proceeds is capital preservation and liquidity so that
such funds are readily available to fund our operations."

stock sold in the offering, which will in turn depend on FinPro, Inc.’s
appraisal, regulatory and market considerations, and the expenses incurred in
connection with the offering. Although we will not be able to determine the
actual net proceeds from the sale of the common stock until we complete the
offering, we estimate the net proceeds to be between $11.0 million and $15.5
million, or $18.0 million if the offering is increased by 15%.

How We Intend To Distribute The Net Proceeds From The Offering

We intend to (i) infuse Community Mutual with 50% of the net proceeds from the
offering, (ii) make a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to fund its
purchase of 8.0% of the common stock issued in the offering, and (iii) retain
the rest of the proceeds at the holding company for capital needs that arise in
the future. This is set forth in the table below.

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the conversion and
offering may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would
increase if a syndicated community offering is used to sell shares not purchased
in the subscription offering and community offering. The net proceeds will also
vary if the number of shares to be sold in the offering are adjusted to reflect
a change in the estimated pro forma market value of CMS Bancorp and Community
Mutual. Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit
accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by Community
Mutual but will result in a reduction of Community Mutual’s deposits and
interest expense as funds are transferred from interest bearing certificates of
deposit or other deposit accounts.

How We May Use The Proceeds We Retain From The Offering

The net proceeds raised in the offering will allow Community Mutual to better
serve the needs of its community by:

    •   supporting future lending and operational growth, including de novo branch 
        expansion and acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches     
        (although we have no such acquisitions planned at this time) and the       
        formation of an FDIC-insured, New York State-chartered limited purpose     
        commercial bank for the purpose of accepting municipal deposits and other  
        public funds;                                                              

    •   enhancing existing products and services and support the development of new
        products and services, such as a website, and, at a later date, online     
        banking;                                                                   

    •   renovating existing retail banking offices;

    •   enhancing its ability to attract and retain qualified directors, management
        and other employees through stock-based incentive plans;                   

    •   repaying borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York; and

    •   upgrading its technology infrastructure, marketing, training and staff     
        recruitment.                                                               

We will use the capital retained by us to:

    •   pay dividends to stockholders (although we do not intend to pay dividends  
        during the first year after the conversion and the offering);              
 
    •   repurchase shares of our common stock;

    •   finance acquisitions of other financial institutions or other businesses   
        related to banking (although no mergers or acquisitions are planned at the 
        present time); and                                                         

    •   fund other general corporate purposes.

The conversion also allows us to form a foundation to benefit the communities in
which Community Mutual maintains its corporate office or a retail banking
office.

Initially, both we and Community Mutual intend to invest the net proceeds from
the offering in short-term investments and mortgage-backed and asset-backed
securities until these proceeds can be deployed for the purposes discussed
above.

Community Mutual is currently completing renovations of its retail banking
office located in Mount Vernon, New York. The completion of the renovations is
expected to cost approximately $575,000. In addition, Community Mutual
anticipates that it will undertake renovations of its other retail banking
offices, at an estimated cost of $500,000. The renovations of Community Mutual’s
retail banking offices are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year
2007. Community Mutual is also engaged in technology upgrades that it
anticipates will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2007, at an estimated
cost of $100,000. Finally, Community Mutual expects that its website at
www.cmsbk.com will be completed by April 2007, at an estimated cost of $15,000.

Community Mutual’s borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, if
any, will be repaid upon closing of the offering."

shares of common stock in the offering will be until the offering is completed,
we anticipate that the net proceeds will be between $99.9 million and $135.6
million, or $156.2 million if the offering range is increased by 15%. We
estimate that we will contribute to ESSA Bank & Trust between $50.0 million and
$67.8 million, or $78.1 million if the offering range is increased by 15%. We

    commencement of the offering, or regulatory considerations.                  

(2) ESSA Bancorp, Inc. will make the cash contribution to ESSA Bank & Trust      
    Foundation.                                                                  

Payments for shares of common stock made through withdrawals from existing
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but
will result in a reduction of ESSA Bank & Trust’s deposits. The net proceeds may
vary because the total expenses relating to the offering may be more or less
than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a syndicated
community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not purchased in the
subscription and community offerings.

ESSA Bancorp, Inc. May Use the Proceeds it Retains From the Offering:

     •   to fund a loan to the employee stock ownership plan to purchase shares of 
         common stock in the offering (between $8.7 million and $11.8 million, or  
         $13.6 million if the offering is increased by 15%);                       

     •   to invest in debt securities issued by the United States government and   
         United States government-sponsored agencies or entities;                  

     •   to finance the acquisition of financial institutions, branches or other   
         financial service companies;                                              

     •   to pay cash dividends to stockholders;

     •   to repurchase shares of our common stock; and

     •   for other general corporate purposes.

Initially, we intend to invest a substantial portion of the net proceeds in
short-term investments, investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed
securities.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the conversion,
except to fund equity benefit plans other than stock options or except when
extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory approval.

ESSA Bank & Trust May Use the Net Proceeds it Receives From the Offering:

     •   to expand its retail and commercial banking franchise by acquiring or     
         establishing new branches, or by acquiring other financial institutions or
         other financial services companies;                                       

     •   to fund new loans, including residential first mortgage loans, commercial 
         loans, commercial real estate and home equity loans and lines of credit;  

     •   to enhance existing products and services and to support new products and 
         services;                                                                 

     •   to reduce a portion of our existing borrowings;

     •   to invest in debt securities issued by the United States government and   
         United States government-sponsored agencies or entities; and              

     •   for other general corporate purposes.

Our short-term and long-term growth plans anticipate that, upon completion of
the offering, we will experience measured growth through increased lending and
investment activities, de novo branching and, possibly, acquisitions, with a
particular emphasis on attempting to stimulate internal loan growth. We plan to
explore acquisition opportunities involving other banks and thrifts, and
possibly financial service companies, when and as they arise as a means of
supplementing internal growth. We may also consider establishing de novo
branches or acquiring financial institutions in our market area and contiguous
counties.

We have no current arrangements or agreements to acquire other banks, thrifts or
financial service companies. We have received regulatory approval to open a new
branch office in Tannersville, Pennsylvania which we anticipate opening in May
2007. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any
acquisition or establish any other new branches.

Initially, the net proceeds will be invested in short-term investments,
investment-grade debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities."

offering will be approximately $67.9 million, or $78.3 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based on the initial
public offering price of $15.00 per share, and after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund the growth of our
business, including:
 
    •  approximately $20.0 million for clinical development of Amigal for the     
       treatment of Fabry disease;                                                
   
    •  approximately $20.0 million for clinical development of Plicera for the    
       treatment of Gaucher disease;                                              
   
    •  approximately $20.0 million for clinical development of AT2220 for the     
       treatment of Pompe disease;                                                

    •  approximately $5.0 million for research and development activities relating
       to additional preclinical programs; and                                    

    •  the balance, if any, to fund working capital and other general corporate   
       purposes, which may include the acquisition or licensing of complementary  
       technologies, products or businesses.                                      
 
The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our intentions
based on our current plans and business conditions. The amount and timing of our
actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the progress of
our research and development activities and clinical trials, the number and
breadth of our product development programs, whether or not we establish
corporate collaborations and other arrangements, and the amount of cash, if any,
generated by our operations and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, we will
retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of the remaining net proceeds
of this offering. We do not expect the net proceeds from this offering and our
other available funds to be sufficient to fund the completion of the development
of our lead product candidates, and we expect that we will need to raise
additional funds prior to being able to market any products. We have no current
plans, agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or licenses of
any technologies, products or businesses.
 
We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, along with our existing cash
resources, will be sufficient to enable us to complete Phase III clinical trials
of Amigal for the treatment of Fabry disease, initiate Phase III clinical trials
of Plicera for the treatment of Gaucher Disease, and complete Phase II clinical
trials of AT2220 for the treatment of Pompe Disease. We also believe that the
funds from the offering will enable us to advance our preclinical studies of
different pharmacological chaperones for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease
and possibly other programs. As to our clinical programs, it is possible that we
will not achieve the progress that we anticipate because the actual costs and
timing of development are difficult to predict, are subject to substantial
risks, and often vary depending on the particular indication and development
strategy. As a result, we may need to raise additional funds from external
sources to achieve the expected development progress described in this
paragraph.
 
Pending application of the net proceeds, as described above, we intend to invest
any remaining proceeds in a variety of short-term, investment-grade,
interest-bearing securities."

——————
(1) As of the date of this prospectus, approximately $413,000 of the offering
expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the NASD filing fee, accounting
fees, miscellaneous expenses and a portion of the legal fees, have been paid
from the initial investment we received from our initial stockholders.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
initial shares and insider warrants.

(3) We received $1,550,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of the initial shares.
$1,100,000 of such amount is being placed in the trust account, while
approximately $413,000 has been used by us to pay a portion of the offering
expenses (as referred to above in the section titled “Offering expenses” and
which we will receive back at closing) with the balance being used to partially
fund the amount not held in trust.

(4) We could use a portion of these funds to pay the $7,400,000 fee payable to
HCFP/Brenner Securities and Pali Capital described below. However, we could, in
the alternative, pay such fee from other funds available to us following a
business combination and, therefore, have not deducted such amount from this
line item.

(5) The $500,000 allocated to legal, accounting and other third-party expenses
relating to structuring and negotiating a business combination are amounts we
expect to pay to attorneys, accountants and other third parties we retain
throughout the process of structuring and negotiating a business combination,
including legal and financial diligence, merger negotiations and regulatory
filings and approvals.

(6) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $300,000 even
if the over-allotment option is exercised. In addition, $3,000,000 of interest
income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us
to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of presentation, the
full amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds
available to us immediately following the offering.

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, our officers, directors
and senior advisors have previously purchased, or committed to purchase, an
aggregate of $6,000,000 of our securities, consisting of 6,250,000 initial
shares previously purchased from us for $1,550,000, or approximately $0.25 per
share, and 5,975,000 insider warrants to be purchased for $4,450,000, or
approximately $0.75 per warrant. The purchases of insider warrants will take
place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this
offering. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the
purchase of the initial shares and insider warrants. All of the proceeds we
receive from the purchase of the insider warrants will be placed in the trust
account described below.

$192,850,000, or $221,875,000 if the representative’s over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of the net proceeds, plus amounts we have received or will
receive from the sale of our securities to our officers, directors and senior
advisors, will be placed in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not
be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may
be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
ultimately complete a business combination.

The payment to PLM International Inc., an affiliate of Gary D. Engle, our
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and James A. Coyne, our Chief
Financial Officer and a Director, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and administrative
support. This arrangement is for our benefit and is not intended to provide
Messrs. Engle and Coyne with compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based
on rents and fees for similar services in the midtown New York City area, that
the fee charged by PLM International Inc. is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, we will
have approximately $300,000 available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account, up to $3,000,000, may be released to us to fund our working
capital requirements. We will also be entitled to have interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any tax obligations that
we may owe. We intend to use approximately $150,000 of the working capital
allocation to pay the fees of an investment banking firm which we may engage to
deliver a fairness opinion and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, and hold the balance of $2,070,000 in reserve in case due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our officers and/or directors in connection
with activities on our behalf as described below and to pay other miscellaneous
expenses, including the fees of a financial relations firm that we may engage at
the time we execute a definitive agreement relating to a business combination.
In addition, although we have no present intention to do so, we could in the
future find it necessary or desirable to use a portion of these funds allocated
to working capital to make a down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision (a
provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from
“shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable
to such target businesses) with respect to a particular business combination. If
so, any such amount would be based on the terms of the specific business
combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. If we use a
portion of our funds for such a purpose and the related business combination
does not occur and we are required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of
our breach of the agreement relating to the original payment or otherwise), we
could, if such payment was large enough and we had already used up the funds
allocated to due diligence and related expenses in connection with the aborted
transaction, be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for, or
conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential target businesses.

The allocation of net proceeds not held in trust represents management’s best
estimate of its intended uses of these funds. In the event that its assumptions
prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above
described categories. We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds
of this offering, including the funds held in the trust account, together with
our existing cash, to acquire a target business.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund that are not used for such purpose, as well as any other net proceeds not
expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the
target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
aggregate $7,400,000 fee payable to HCFP/Brenner Securities, the representative
of the underwriters, and Pali Capital, one of the underwriters, upon the
consummation of a business combination for acting as our investment bankers on a
non-exclusive basis to assist us in obtaining approval of a business combination
(but not for purposes of locating potential target candidates for our business
combination). The funds used to pay this fee will not be available to us to use 
in connection with or following the business combination and therefore may 
require us to issue our securities in order to consummate a potential business 
combination. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways, 
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic 
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new 
products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or 
finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business 
combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust account were 
insufficient to cover such expenses.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or cash
equivalents or be invested only in United States “government securities,” (as
such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) and one or more
money market funds selected by us, which invest principally in either short-term
securities issued or guaranteed by the United States having a rating in the
highest investment category granted thereby by a nationally recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or short-term exempt municipal bonds
issued by governmental entities located within the United States and otherwise
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. The interest income derived from investment of these
net proceeds during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the funds available to us
outside the trust, together with interest income earned on the trust account
which we are permitted to have released to us, will provide sufficient funds to
operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not
consummated during that time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay PLM International Inc. the
fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our initial stockholders, including our officers or directors, or any
of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination. However, they will
receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since
the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we
have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund, net of
taxes and interest income on the trust account previously released to us) only
in the event there is no business combination or if that public stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund."

sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in this offering at an initial
public offering price of $12.00 per share, and after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

       We expect to use our proceeds from this offering approximately as
follows:

             º $50 to 55 million to build an LNG liquefaction plant in
               California,

             º $30 to 35 million to build CNG and LNG fueling stations,

             º $15 to 20 million to finance the purchase of natural gas vehicles
               by our customers, and

             º any remaining balance for general corporate purposes, including
               making deposits to support our derivative activities, geographic
               expansion (domestically and perhaps internationally) and to
               expand our sales and marketing activities.

       We may also use any remaining proceeds from this offering to acquire
additional assets or businesses, though no acquisitions are currently pending.
We will not receive any of the proceeds from any sale of shares by the selling
stockholders if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares to cover any over-allotments.

       Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds
from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

(1)  There is no placement fee paid or payable by us in connection with the sale
     of the founder warrants.

(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds advanced
     to us by Shermen Capital Partners, LLC as part of the $150,000 limited
     recourse loan described below.

(3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer this amount until the consummation of
     our initial business combination. Upon the consummation of our initial
     business combination, we will pay such deferred fees (less $0.24 for each
     share of common stock converted to cash in connection with our initial
     business combination) to the underwriters out of the proceeds of this
     offering held in a trust account at JP Morgan Chase, N.A., maintained by
     Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.

(4)  Miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of Shermen Capital
     Partners, LLC, and our directors and officers for out-of-pocket expenses
     incurred in connection with the offering.

(5)  Equivalent to $5.97 per unit if the underwriters over-allotment option is
     not exercised, and approximately $5.95 per unit if the underwriters
     over-allotment option is exercised in full.

(6)  The total net proceeds includes an aggregate of approximately $3,650,000
     payable immediately after with this offering by certain of our directors
     and officers for the purchase of 5,214,286 warrants through Shermen WSC 
     Holding LLC in a private placement concurrently with this offering.

(7)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
     items may differ from those set forth herein.

(8)  We currently estimate costs and expenses to be incurred in connection with
     our plan of dissolution and liquidation to be at approximately $50,000 to
     $75,000.

    We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units and the founder
warrants to acquire an operating business in the agriculture industry.

    Of the net proceeds we receive from our unit offering and the private
placement of the founder warrants, $119,400,000 (approximately $5.97 per unit)
will be deposited into a trust account at JP Morgan Chase, N.A., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we ultimately complete a business combination. Additionally, although we have no
present intention to do so, it is possible that we will in the future find it
necessary or desirable to use a portion of the funds in the trust account to
make a down payment or deposit or fund a lock-up or ""no-shop"" provision, with
respect to a potential business combination. If so, any such amount would be
based on the terms of the specific transaction and the amount of available funds
at the time. If we use a significant portion of our funds for such a purpose and
we are required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the
agreement relating to the original payment or otherwise), we could, if such
payment was large enough and we had already used some or all of the funds
allocated to due diligence and related expenses in connection with the aborted
transaction, be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for, or to
conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential target businesses. In
that event, we may be required to liquidate before the completion of a business
combination. Additionally, the proceeds held in the trust account will be used
to pay the underwriters a deferred fee equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of
the unit offering, or $4,800,000, less $0.24 for each share of common stock
converted to cash in connection with our initial business combination, upon the
consummation of our initial business combination; this portion of the proceeds
held in the trust account will not be available for our use to acquire an
operating business. We may use all of the remaining net proceeds of this
offering held in the trust account to acquire an operating business. However, we
may not use all of the remaining proceeds in the trust account in connection
with a business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock, debt securities or bank
financing. In that event, the proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any
other net proceeds not expended, may be used to finance the operations of the
target business, which may include subsequent acquisitions.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the funds available to
us outside of the trust account, approximately $115,000 and one half of the
interest on the trust account, net of taxes payable, up to a total of
$1,500,000, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next
24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that
time. Over this time period, we anticipate making the following expenditures:

        º approximately $870,000 of expenses for legal, accounting and other
          expenses attendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring
          and negotiating of a business combination, including without
          limitation third party fees for assisting us in performing due
          diligence investigations of perspective target businesses;

        º approximately $110,000 of expenses in legal and accounting fees
          relating to our SEC reporting obligations;

        º approximately $260,000 of expenses in fees relating to our office
          space and certain general and administrative services; and

        º approximately $375,000 for general working capital that will be used
          for miscellaneous expenses, including approximately $200,000 for
          director and officer liability and other insurance premiums and
          $150,000 for the repayment of the limited recourse loan from Shermen
          Capital Partners, LLC.

    We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $375,000) for
premiums for director and officer liability insurance (approximately $200,000)
and the repayment of the limited recourse loan from Shermen Capital Partners,
LLC ($150,000), with the balance of $25,000 being held in reserve for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders, directors and officers in connection with activities on our behalf
as described below. We expect that due diligence of a prospective target
business will be performed by some or all of our existing stockholders,
directors and officers. None of our existing stockholders, directors or officers
will receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our
behalf while performing due diligence of a prospective target business. To date,
our existing stockholders, directors and officers have not performed due
diligence of any prospective target business. Any reimbursement of reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our discretion. To the extent such
out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate a business combination. In addition, we may opt to make a down
payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with structuring and
negotiating a business combination. We have not reserved any specific amounts
for a down payment, exclusivity fees, finder's fees or similar fees or
compensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses
and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used to finance the operations of the target business and to
pay finders' fees, if any.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the amount of the net
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the founder warrants not held in the
trust account, (approximately $115,000 after the payment of the expenses
relating to this offering), and the interest on the trust account, net of taxes,
up to a total of $1,500,000 available for working capital purpose will be
sufficient to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. These amounts are based on
management's estimate of the amount needed to fund our operations for the next
24 months and to consummate a business combination. This estimate may prove
inaccurate, especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to make a
down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business
combination or if we expend a significant portion of the available funds in
pursuit of a business combination that is not consummated. If we do not have
sufficient funds available to cover our expenses, we may be forced to obtain
additional financing, either from our existing stockholders, directors and
officers or third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional financing and
our existing stockholders, directors and officers are not obligated to provide
any additional financing. If we do not have sufficient funds and cannot find
additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate prior to consummating a
business combination.

    We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $9,950 for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York, New York
metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Shermen Capital Partners, LLC is at
least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party.
Francis P. Jenkins, Jr., our chairman and chief executive officer, is the
managing member of Shermen Capital Partners, LLC.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in U.S. ""government securities,""
defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United States government having a
maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less, or any open ended investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that holds itself
out as a money market fund and bears the highest credit rating issued by a United 
States nationally recognized rating agency. By restricting the investment of the
proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the
exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of
1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The interest income earned on investment of the net
proceeds not held in trust during this period will be used to defray our general
and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with
securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a
business combination is completed.

    Neither we nor any other person or entity will pay any of our existing
stockholders, directors or officers or any entity with which they are
affiliated, any finders fee or other compensation for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with a business combination. However, our existing
stockholders, directors and officers will receive reimbursement for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with our
organization, this offering and activities on our behalf, such as participating
in the offering process, identifying a potential target operating business and
performing due diligence on a suitable business combination. We have not
reserved any specific amount for such payments, which may have the effect of
reducing the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment
of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on
our behalf. In addition, since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons for periods after a business combination.

    Public stockholders will be entitled to receive the amount in our trust
account, including the amount representing the deferred portion of the
underwriters' fee and any interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes
payable) not made available to fund our working capital requirements in the
event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination
within 18 months after consummation of this offering (or within 24 months after
the consummation of this offering if a letter of intent, agreement in principle
or definitive agreement has been executed within 18 months after consummation of
this offering and the business combination relating thereto has not yet been
consummated within such 18-month period). Public stockholders voting against a
business combination will also be entitled to convert their stock into a pro
rata share (based on the number of units sold in this offering) of the amount
held in the trust account, including the amount held in the trust account
representing the deferred portion of the underwriters' fee and any interest
earned on their pro rata share (net of taxes payable) not made available to fund
our working capital requirements. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right to or interest of any kind in the trust account.

    In the event of our liquidation, as described above, our existing
stockholders, directors and officers will be entitled to receive funds from the
trust account solely with respect to any shares of common stock which they
purchased in this offering."

(1)  There is no placement fee paid or payable by us in connection with the sale
     of the founder warrants.

(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds advanced
     to us by Shermen Capital Partners, LLC as part of the $150,000 limited
     recourse loan described below.

(3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer this amount until the consummation of
     our initial business combination. Upon the consummation of our initial
     business combination, we will pay such deferred fees (less $0.24 for each
     share of common stock converted to cash in connection with our initial
     business combination) to the underwriters out of the proceeds of this
     offering held in a trust account at JP Morgan Chase, N.A., maintained by
     Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.

(4)  Miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of Shermen Capital
     Partners, LLC, and our directors and officers for out-of-pocket expenses
     incurred in connection with the offering.

(5)  Equivalent to $5.97 per unit if the underwriters over-allotment option is
     not exercised, and approximately $5.95 per unit if the underwriters
     over-allotment option is exercised in full.

(6)  The total net proceeds includes an aggregate of approximately $3,650,000
     payable immediately after with this offering by certain of our directors
     and officers for the purchase of 5,214,286 warrants through Shermen WSC 
     Holding LLC in a private placement concurrently with this offering.

(7)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
     items may differ from those set forth herein.

(8)  We currently estimate costs and expenses to be incurred in connection with
     our plan of dissolution and liquidation to be at approximately $50,000 to
     $75,000.

    We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units and the founder
warrants to acquire an operating business in the agriculture industry.

    Of the net proceeds we receive from our unit offering and the private
placement of the founder warrants, $119,400,000 (approximately $5.97 per unit)
will be deposited into a trust account at JP Morgan Chase, N.A., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we ultimately complete a business combination. Additionally, although we have no
present intention to do so, it is possible that we will in the future find it
necessary or desirable to use a portion of the funds in the trust account to
make a down payment or deposit or fund a lock-up or ""no-shop"" provision, with
respect to a potential business combination. If so, any such amount would be
based on the terms of the specific transaction and the amount of available funds
at the time. If we use a significant portion of our funds for such a purpose and
we are required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the
agreement relating to the original payment or otherwise), we could, if such
payment was large enough and we had already used some or all of the funds
allocated to due diligence and related expenses in connection with the aborted
transaction, be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for, or to
conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential target businesses. In
that event, we may be required to liquidate before the completion of a business
combination. Additionally, the proceeds held in the trust account will be used
to pay the underwriters a deferred fee equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of
the unit offering, or $4,800,000, less $0.24 for each share of common stock
converted to cash in connection with our initial business combination, upon the
consummation of our initial business combination; this portion of the proceeds
held in the trust account will not be available for our use to acquire an
operating business. We may use all of the remaining net proceeds of this
offering held in the trust account to acquire an operating business. However, we
may not use all of the remaining proceeds in the trust account in connection
with a business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock, debt securities or bank
financing. In that event, the proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any
other net proceeds not expended, may be used to finance the operations of the
target business, which may include subsequent acquisitions.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the funds available to
us outside of the trust account, approximately $115,000 and one half of the
interest on the trust account, net of taxes payable, up to a total of
$1,500,000, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next
24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that
time. Over this time period, we anticipate making the following expenditures:

        º approximately $870,000 of expenses for legal, accounting and other
          expenses attendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring
          and negotiating of a business combination, including without
          limitation third party fees for assisting us in performing due
          diligence investigations of perspective target businesses;

        º approximately $110,000 of expenses in legal and accounting fees
          relating to our SEC reporting obligations;

        º approximately $260,000 of expenses in fees relating to our office
          space and certain general and administrative services; and

        º approximately $375,000 for general working capital that will be used
          for miscellaneous expenses, including approximately $200,000 for
          director and officer liability and other insurance premiums and
          $150,000 for the repayment of the limited recourse loan from Shermen
          Capital Partners, LLC.

    We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $375,000) for
premiums for director and officer liability insurance (approximately $200,000)
and the repayment of the limited recourse loan from Shermen Capital Partners,
LLC ($150,000), with the balance of $25,000 being held in reserve for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders, directors and officers in connection with activities on our behalf
as described below. We expect that due diligence of a prospective target
business will be performed by some or all of our existing stockholders,
directors and officers. None of our existing stockholders, directors or officers
will receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our
behalf while performing due diligence of a prospective target business. To date,
our existing stockholders, directors and officers have not performed due
diligence of any prospective target business. Any reimbursement of reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our discretion. To the extent such
out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate a business combination. In addition, we may opt to make a down
payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with structuring and
negotiating a business combination. We have not reserved any specific amounts
for a down payment, exclusivity fees, finder's fees or similar fees or
compensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses
and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used to finance the operations of the target business and to
pay finders' fees, if any.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the amount of the net
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the founder warrants not held in the
trust account, (approximately $115,000 after the payment of the expenses
relating to this offering), and the interest on the trust account, net of taxes,
up to a total of $1,500,000 available for working capital purpose will be
sufficient to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. These amounts are based on
management's estimate of the amount needed to fund our operations for the next
24 months and to consummate a business combination. This estimate may prove
inaccurate, especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to make a
down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business
combination or if we expend a significant portion of the available funds in
pursuit of a business combination that is not consummated. If we do not have
sufficient funds available to cover our expenses, we may be forced to obtain
additional financing, either from our existing stockholders, directors and
officers or third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional financing and
our existing stockholders, directors and officers are not obligated to provide
any additional financing. If we do not have sufficient funds and cannot find
additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate prior to consummating a
business combination.

    We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $9,950 for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York, New York
metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Shermen Capital Partners, LLC is at
least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party.
Francis P. Jenkins, Jr., our chairman and chief executive officer, is the
managing member of Shermen Capital Partners, LLC.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in U.S. ""government securities,""
defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United States government having a
maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less, or any open ended investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that holds itself
out as a money market fund and bears the highest credit rating issued by a United 
States nationally recognized rating agency. By restricting the investment of the
proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the
exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of
1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The interest income earned on investment of the net
proceeds not held in trust during this period will be used to defray our general
and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with
securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a
business combination is completed.

    Neither we nor any other person or entity will pay any of our existing
stockholders, directors or officers or any entity with which they are
affiliated, any finders fee or other compensation for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with a business combination. However, our existing
stockholders, directors and officers will receive reimbursement for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with our
organization, this offering and activities on our behalf, such as participating
in the offering process, identifying a potential target operating business and
performing due diligence on a suitable business combination. We have not
reserved any specific amount for such payments, which may have the effect of
reducing the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment
of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on
our behalf. In addition, since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons for periods after a business combination.

    Public stockholders will be entitled to receive the amount in our trust
account, including the amount representing the deferred portion of the
underwriters' fee and any interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes
payable) not made available to fund our working capital requirements in the
event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination
within 18 months after consummation of this offering (or within 24 months after
the consummation of this offering if a letter of intent, agreement in principle
or definitive agreement has been executed within 18 months after consummation of
this offering and the business combination relating thereto has not yet been
consummated within such 18-month period). Public stockholders voting against a
business combination will also be entitled to convert their stock into a pro
rata share (based on the number of units sold in this offering) of the amount
held in the trust account, including the amount held in the trust account
representing the deferred portion of the underwriters' fee and any interest
earned on their pro rata share (net of taxes payable) not made available to fund
our working capital requirements. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right to or interest of any kind in the trust account.

    In the event of our liquidation, as described above, our existing
stockholders, directors and officers will be entitled to receive funds from the
trust account solely with respect to any shares of common stock which they
purchased in this offering."

from the sale by us of 2,100,000 ordinary shares in this offering or
$29.5 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated
remaining offering expenses.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We may
also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,
companies, technologies or products that complement our business. We currently
have no specific plans, commitments, proposals, arrangements or agreements for
any future mergers or acquisitions or investments. Our management will have
broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending use
of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments with maturities of less than one
year or deposit the net proceeds in bank accounts in or outside our home
country."

——————

(1)A portion of the offering expenses, including SEC registration fees and NASD
filing fees, legal and accounting fees and expenses have been paid from the
$125,000 loan by our sponsors, which loan shall be repaid out of the proceeds
upon the closing of this offering.

(2)Represents 3.75% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the units, or $0.30 
per unit, for underwriting compensation of $1,350,000 (3.25% of the gross 
proceeds from the sale of the units pursuant to the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option, or $0.26 per unit, for the total underwriting 
compensation of up to $1,525,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in 
full).

(3)Represents 3.25% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the units, or $0.26 
per unit, for total deferred compensation of $1,170,000 (3.75% of the gross 
proceeds from the sale of the units pursuant to the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option, or $0.30 per unit, for the total deferred underwriting 
compensation of up to $1,372,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) for the amount held in trust of deferred underwriting 
compensation which will be paid to the representatives only upon the completion 
of the initial business combination only with respect to those units which have
not been converted and will not be available for use to acquire an operating 
business. In the event that a business combination is not completed within the 
required time period, these amounts will be included in the liquidating 
distribution to our public stockholders.

(4)Up to $600,000 ($800,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in
full) of the interest (net of taxes) earned on amounts in trust may be released
to us for working capital.

(5)The miscellaneous fees and expenses may include, without limitation, 
potential deposits, down payments, exclusivity fees, franchise taxes, finder’s 
fees or similar fees or compensation, premiums for director and officer 
liability and key-man insurance, reserves and costs and expenses associated 
with our dissolution and liquidation.

Of the proceeds from this offering and the private placement, $35,530,000
($40,754,500, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full),
of which $1,170,000 ($1,372,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) is attributable to the deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions, will be placed in a trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
Except for the $100,000 held outside the trust, amounts necessary to pay taxes
on the interest earned on the trust account, and interest income released to us,
net of taxes, of up to $600,000 ($800,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) for working capital, the proceeds will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our dissolution and liquidation. All amounts held in the
trust account that are not converted to cash, released to us to pay taxes on
interest earned or as interest income, net of taxes, for working capital will be
released on closing of our initial business combination with one or more target
businesses which have a fair market value of at least 80% of our net assets
(excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the
representatives of $1,170,000 ($1,372,500, if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) at the time of such business combination, subject
to a majority of our public stockholders voting in favor of the business
combination and less than 20% of the public stockholders voting against the
business combination and exercising their conversion rights. Following release
from the trust account of interest income to pay income taxes and for working
capital, as described above, and after payment of the conversion price to any
public stockholders who exercise their conversion rights, the representatives
will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, and the
remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion
of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial
business combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for using stock
or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account
for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of
operations of the acquired business, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination or for
working capital. Although we do not know the rate of interest to be earned on
the trust account and are unable to predict an exact amount of time it will take
to complete a business combination, we anticipate that the interest that will
accrue on the trust account, even at an interest rate of 3% (approximately
$1,065,900 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised) per
annum, during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an
acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements.

The net proceeds of this offering held in the trust account will only be
invested in United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill
issued by the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We believe that the interest
earned from the trust proceeds held in trust will generate sufficient funding to
satisfy our working requirements. According to the Federal Reserve Statistical
Release dated December 31, 2006, referencing historical interest rate data which
appears on the Federal Reserve website, U.S. Treasury Bills with four week,
three month and six month maturities were yielding, as of the week ending
December 31, 2006, 4.718%, 5.006% and 5.091%, respectively. While we cannot
assure you the balance of the trust account will be invested to yield these
rates, we believe such rates are representative of those we may receive on the
balance of the trust account. Interest income, net of income taxes payable on
such interest, of up to $600,000 ($800,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment
is exercised in full) on the trust account balance is releasable to us from the
trust account to fund a portion of our working capital requirements. Following
completion of this offering, we believe the funds available to us outside of the
trust account of $100,000, together with interest income, net of income taxes on
such interest, of up to $600,000 ($800,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment
is exercised in full) on the balance of the trust account to be released to us
for working capital requirements, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for
at least the next 24 months, assuming a business combination is not completed 
during that time. Because the initial working capital of $100,000 is being 
funded from proceeds of this offering, we do not expect that we will need to 
rely on advances from our officers prior to the receipt of interest earned from
the proceeds held in trust.

We have agreed to pay Lotus Capital LLC a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and
administrative services, including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. We believe that, based on rents and fees for similar services in the
New York metropolitan area, the fee charged by Lotus Capital LLC is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party. This
agreement commences on the date of this prospectus and will continue until 18
months after completion of this offering (or 24 months after the completion of
this offering if a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive
agreement has been executed within 18 months after completion of this offering
and the business combination related thereto has not been completed within such
18-month period).

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $50,000) for
potential deposits, down payments, exclusivity fees, franchise taxes, finder’s
fees or similar fees or compensation, premiums for director and officer
liability and key-man insurance, reserves and costs and expenses associated with
our dissolution and liquidation, with the balance of $650,000 being held in
reserve for other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations,
as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our
directors, officers and special advisors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below. Of this amount, we have reserved approximately
$70,000 for reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with conducting due
diligence reviews of prospective target businesses. We expect that due diligence
of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of our
officers and directors and may include engaging market research and valuation
firms, as well as other third party consultants. None of our officers or
directors will receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other
than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf
while performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. To the extent
such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account of $100,000 and interest income, net of income taxes, of up to
$600,000 ($800,000, if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full)
that may be released to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses
would not be reimbursed by us unless we complete a business combination. We have
not reserved any specific amounts for such payments or fees, which may have the
effect of reducing the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for
payment of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
incurred on our behalf.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsors have loaned to us the principal
sum of $125,000 in order to pay certain of the expenses associated with this
offering such as the SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and legal and
accounting fees and expenses. We will repay this loan, together with interest at
the rate of 4% per annum, on the closing of this offering out of the proceeds
thereof.

No compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be
paid to any of our officers, directors, special advisors or existing
stockholders or any of their affiliates, other than the payment of $7,500 per
month to Lotus Capital LLC from the trust account in connection with the general
and administrative services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
business combination. However, our officers, directors, special advisors and
existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
participating in the offering process, identifying potential target businesses
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role
of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no
ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons
after a business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in
whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds
held in the trust fund, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be
used to finance the operations of the target business, pay principal or interest
due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the business combination or for
other working capital purposes.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable and interest amounts previously released to us from the trust
account) only in the event of our dissolution and liquidation upon our failure
to complete a business combination within the allotted time or if that public
stockholder were to seek to convert such shares to cash by exercising conversion
rights in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder
voted against and which we actually complete. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

In the event of our liquidation, our existing stockholders will be entitled to
receive funds from the trust account solely with respect to any shares of our
common stock which they purchased in or following this offering."

(1)A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee,  NASD
filing fee, AMEX filing fee, has been paid from the $275,000 loan from our 
officers and directors, as further described below. These funds will be repaid 
out of the net proceeds of this offering not being deposited in the trust 
account upon consummation of this offering.

(2)Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this
offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 3%, or 
$7,200,000 to be held in trust ($8,280,000 if the underwriter's over-allotment 
option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business combination. Upon 
the consummation of a business combination, such deferred discount shall be 
released to the underwriters out of the gross proceeds of this offering held in
a trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The underwriters
will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred discount.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $250,000
 even if the over-allotment is exercised. We currently estimate that we would 
require up to $15,000 should our corporate existence cease to exist  on May 24,
2009 to liquidate the company in the event we do not consummate a business 
combination. We will be permitted to seek disbursements from the trust account 
of interest income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the 
trust account, up to an aggregate of $2,250,000 for working capital purposes.

Of the net proceeds of this offering, $222,200,000 (or $255,680,000 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $6,000,000 from the purchase of
founder securities, for an aggregate of $228,200,000 (or $261,680,000 if the
over-allotment is exercised in full) will be placed in a trust account at
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Additionally, $7,200,000 (or
$8,280,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
the proceeds attributable to the underwriters' discount will be deposited into
such trustee account for a total amount in trust of $235,400,000 (or
$269,960,000 if the over-allotment is exercised in full). The proceeds will not
be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or as part of any liquidation of our trust account. To the
extent the trust account earns interest or we are deemed to have earned income
in connection therewith, we will be permitted to seek disbursements from the
trust account to pay any federal, state or local tax obligations related thereto
or any franchise tax obligations. The proceeds held in the trust account may be
used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisition with which we
complete a business combination (excluding the amount held in the trust account
representing a portion of the underwriters' discount). Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business will be used to finance our
operations, which may include the target business(es) we acquired on the
consummation of the business combination, to effect other acquisitions, or for
working capital, as determined by our board of directors at that time. All
amounts held in the trust account that are not converted to cash or released to
us as interest income, net of income taxes, will be released on closing of our
initial business combination with a target acquisition having a fair market
value of at least 80% of our net assets (excluding the amount held in the trust
account representing a portion of the underwriter's discount) at the time of
such business combination, subject to a majority of our public stockholders
voting in favor of the business combination and less than 30% of the public
stockholders voting against the business combination and electing their
conversion rights. The 30% threshold is 20% in most similar entities. 

We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of approximately $8,000 for office space
located in the Houston metropolitan area. The lease term is for 38 months and
the lessor is unaffiliated with the Company. The landlord for the lease is
Gateway Ridgecrest, Inc. As part of the negotiation, the landlord required a
38 month lease term if we were to secure the lease for the space. In the event
that a business combination is not approved within 24 months, Paul Bragg has
agreed to assume personally the responsibility for the balance of the lease
payments for the remaining fourteen months.

We intend to use the $250,000 of net proceeds not held in trust for due
diligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition including
investment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring and
negotiating business combination, as well as a possible down payment, reverse
break up fees (a provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to the
target company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up or
""no-shop"" provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target
acquisitions from ""shopping"" around for transactions with other companies on
terms more favorable to such target acquisitions), if necessary, to bear the
costs of liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a business
combination by May 24, 2009. While we do not have any current intention to use
these funds as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter
of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target
acquisition, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a
""no-shop"" provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific
business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our
forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could
result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or
conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target acquisitions. In
addition to the use of funds described above, we could also use a portion of
these funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
acquisition. We believe that the interest income will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses.

To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or
in part as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event that
indebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as consideration
to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which
are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third party
indebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors would not be
personally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business 
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is 
less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the 
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event,
the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance our operations, which may include the target
business(es) that we acquire on the business combination, to effect other
acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board of directors at
that time. We may use these funds, among other things, for director and officer
compensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to finance
the operations of the target acquisition, to make other acquisitions and to
pursue our growth strategy.

In the event that third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering, our officers and directors would be personally liable
for the repayment of such indebtedness. Our officers and directors have advanced
to us a total of $275,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of
this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fees, NASD
registration fees, AMEX application and listing fees, blue sky filing fees and
legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on
the earlier of January 31, 2008, or the consummation of this offering. The loan
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not held in trust.

The proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in United
States ""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940. Although the rate of interest to be earned on 
the trust account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust account, and
although we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will take to 
complete a business combination, we anticipate the interest that will accrue on
the trust account, even at an interest rate of 4% (up to $2,250,000 interest 
income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the trust 
account), during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an 
acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. While 
we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this rate, we believe such 
rate is representative of that which we may receive. By restricting the 
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed
an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the 
requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distribute the trust account 
to holders of our common stock sold in this offering until after our existence 
terminates by operation of law on May 24, 2009 and, consequently, we may be 
deemed to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such act. 
The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this 
period that is not otherwise returned to public stockholders who vote against a 
business combination will be used to defray our general and administrative 
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and 
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business 
combination is completed. We do not believe that the fees and expenses for due 
diligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, down payment, lock-up or other 
activities related to this offering or our business combination will exceed 
$2,500,000 in the aggregate, comprised of $250,000 of net proceeds not held in 
trust plus up to $2,250,000 of net interest income. Based upon the experience of
the members of our board and consultation with them regarding a reasonable 
budget for consummating a transaction of this kind and nature, and a review of 
budgets publicly disclosed by blank-check companies, we determined that this was
an appropriate approximation of the expenses. If costs are higher than expected
we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due 
diligence with respect to, any potential target acquisitions. In such case, we 
would need to obtain additional funds from our initial stockholders or another 
source to continue operations. We believe that, upon consummation of this 
offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the 
next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during 
that time.

Commencing April 9, 2007 and for 38 months thereafter, we will pay a monthly
fee of approximately $8,000 for office space in the Houston metropolitan area.
The landlord for the lease is Gateway Ridgecrest, Inc. As part of the
negotiation, the landlord required a 38 month lease term if we were to secure
the lease for the space. In the event that a business combination is not
approved within 24 months, Paul Bragg has agreed to assume personally the
responsibility for the balance of the lease payments for the remaining fourteen
months. We will also seek to obtain administrative services including
secretarial support from unaffiliated third parties at prevailing market rates.
We have no arrangement with Vanderbilt Interests, LLC and we do not currently
anticipate any requirement for its services. The only obligation for space as of
the date of prospectus is with Gateway Ridgecrest, Inc. No compensation of any
kind (including finders, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any
of our existing officers, directors or stockholders, or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services that they render in order to effectuate, or in
connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, such
persons will receive reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target acquisitions, performing business
due diligence on suitable target acquisitions and business combinations, as well
as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target acquisitions to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated in
the above table to ""Legal, accounting and other expenses,"" ""Due diligence of 
prospective target acquisitions"" and ""Working capital."" Since the role of 
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a 
business combination.

A public stockholder (but not our founding stockholders with respect to any
shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering or
purchased in the private placement) will be entitled to receive funds from the
trust account (including interest earned on such stockholder's portion of the
trust account, net of taxes payable and amounts disbursed for working capital
purposes) only in the event of our liquidation of the trust account as part of
our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination, or if such
public stockholder converts his shares of common stock into cash in connection
with a business combination that the public stockholder voted against and which
we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Founding
stockholders, directors and officers are not entitled to convert any of their
shares of common stock acquired prior to this offering, in this offering, after
this offering or in the private placement into a pro rata share of the trust
account.

Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount held in trust excluding any accrued interest thereon. In
the event that we are unable to consummate a business combination and the
trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed
that: (i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and any
accrued interest thereon; and (ii) the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public
stockholders along with any accrued interest thereon."

As reflected in the table above, we expect that the net proceeds to be retained
by Louisiana Bancorp will range from $16.5 million to $25.9 million. Louisiana
Bancorp intends to invest 100% of the proceeds it retains from the offering
initially in short-term, liquid investments. Although there can be no assurance
that Louisiana Bancorp will invest the net proceeds in anything other than 
short-term, liquid investments, over time, Louisiana Bancorp may use the 
proceeds it retains from the offering:

•to invest in securities;

•to pay dividends to shareholders;

•to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory restrictions;                                                             

•to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions or branch offices
or other businesses that are related to banking (although we currently have no 
plans, understandings or agreements with respect to any specific acquisitions);
and                                               

•for general corporate purposes.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, Louisiana Bancorp may
not repurchase shares of its common stock during the first year following the
conversion, except to fund equity benefit plans or, with prior regulatory
approval, when extraordinary circumstances exist. We do not anticipate making
any stock repurchases during the first year after our conversion except to fund
our stock recognition and retention plan upon approval by shareholders.

The portion of net proceeds to be contributed to Bank of New Orleans is expected
to range from $21.9 million to $34.3 million. Bank of New Orleans intends to
initially use the net proceeds it receives to purchase investment and
mortgage-backed securities. In the future, Bank of New Orleans may use the
proceeds that it receives from the offering, which is shown in the table above
as the amount contributed to Bank of New Orleans:

•to fund new loans;

•to invest in mortgage-backed securities;

•to finance the possible expansion of its banking franchise, including 
developing new branch locations; and   

•for general corporate purposes.

We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed
above.

We expect to expand the geographic market we serve by opening new branch offices
in areas to the north and west of our current offices. We plan to open one new
office within the first year after the offering is completed and then an
additional branch office every 18 months over the next three to five years. We
expect that each new branch office will cost between $1.5 million to $2.0
million to open. Other than these anticipated uses, we have not specifically
quantified the amounts involved for the net proceeds to be contributed to Bank
of New Orleans. Initially, the bulk of the net proceeds to the bank will be
invested in mortgage-backed securities. In time, we expect a greater amount of
the proceeds will be utilized to fund new loan originations.

Except as described above, neither Louisiana Bancorp nor Bank of New Orleans has
any specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this offering and has
not allocated a specific portion of the proceeds to any particular use."

offered by us pursuant to this prospectus at an initial public offering price of
$22.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering
expenses, will be approximately $255.3 million. We will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of 8,333,333 shares of our common stock being offered by the
selling stockholders pursuant to this prospectus or the additional shares that
would be sold by the selling stockholders if the underwriters exercised their
overallotment option.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds to us from the sale by us of our common stock
to (i) repay $230.7 million of the Senior Term Facility, (ii) pay a $4.6 million
prepayment penalty related to our $230.7 million repayment under the Senior Term
Facility and (iii) pay a termination fee of $20.0 million related to the
termination of the monitoring agreement. 
 
The Senior Term Facility was entered into in connection with the
Recapitalization and consists of a term loan facility in an aggregate principal
amount of up to $1,130 million that matures on November 27, 2013. On the
Recapitalization Closing Date, we borrowed $1,130 million under the Senior Term
Facility. At our election, the interest rates under the Senior Term Facility are
based on a fluctuating interest rate measured by reference to either (1) an
adjusted London inter-bank offered rate, or LIBOR, plus a borrowing margin or
(2) an alternate base rate plus a borrowing margin. Borrowings under the Senior
Term Facility, in addition to borrowings under the Senior ABL Facilities and the
Indenture and the equity investment by the Sponsors, were used by us to pay ACF
the cash consideration for the Recapitalization and to pay certain related

common stock in this offering, at the initial public offering price of $10.00
per share, will be approximately $54.1 million, or approximately $62.4 million
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. This estimate
is after deduction of all underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated
offering expenses that are payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working
capital, establish a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
future access to public markets. We anticipate using the net proceeds from this
offering:

   º to continue the clinical development into Phase 2 of SRT501 for diabetes,
     MELAS and, potentially, other indications (approximately $13.5 million);

   º to advance and expand our preclinical studies and potentially initiate
     clinical development of additional product candidates targeting SIRT1
     (approximately $14.4 million);

   º to expand our research and preclinical development programs targeting other
     sirtuins and related pathways (approximately $9.0 million);

   º to repay existing debt facilities pursuant to their existing terms,
     including interest (approximately $6.9 million); and

   º to apply the remaining funds for general corporate purposes, such as
     general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, working capital
     needs, prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual property, and the
     potential acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, products, or
     companies that complement our business.

We have no current understandings, commitments, or agreements with respect to
any acquisition of or investment in any technologies, products or companies.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the
particular uses for the proceeds from this offering, or the amounts that we will
actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the progress of our
research, development, and commercialization efforts, the progress of our
clinical trials, whether or not we enter into strategic collaborations or
partnerships, and our operating costs and expenditures. Accordingly, our
management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering.

The costs and timing of drug development and regulatory approval, particularly
conducting clinical trials, are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial
risks, and can often change. Accordingly, we may change the allocation of use of
these proceeds as a result of contingencies such as the progress and results of
our clinical trials and other research and development activities, the
establishment of collaborations, the results of our commercialization efforts,
our manufacturing requirements and regulatory or competitive developments. In
addition, assuming our current clinical programs proceed further to the next
stage of clinical development, we do not expect our existing capital resources
and the net proceeds from this offering to be sufficient to enable us to fund
the completion of all such clinical development programs through commercial
introduction. Accordingly, we expect we will need to raise additional funds. 
Based on our current operating plans, we expect proceeds of this offering, 
together with our existing resources, to be sufficient to fund our planned 
operations, including our continued research and drug development, through 
at least the end of 2009.

We may seek additional funding through collaboration agreements and public or
private financings. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable
terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect
the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise
additional funds by issuing equity securities, further dilution to our existing
stockholders may result. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis,
we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or
development programs. We also could be required to seek funds through
arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish
rights to some of our technologies or product candidates which we would
otherwise pursue on our own.

In April 2006, we entered into a loan agreement with a financial institution to
borrow up to $15.0 million, $10.0 million of which was available immediately and
an additional $5.0 million of which may be available during the third quarter of
2007 if certain clinical milestones are achieved. We are obligated to make
interest only payments through July 2007 followed by 45 equal monthly payments
of principal and interest. The loan agreement is secured by primarily all of our
assets except for intellectual property and bears interest at a rate of 10.60%.
In April 2006, we borrowed $10.0 million under the loan agreement. The proceeds
from the loan agreement were used for working capital.

In May 2006, we entered into an equipment loan agreement with a bank to borrow
up to $1.5 million. We are obligated to make interest only payments through
March 2007 followed by 36 equal monthly payments of principal and interest. The
equipment loan agreement is secured by the financed equipment and bears interest
at a rate of prime plus 0.25% (8.50% at December 31, 2006). At December 31, 2006
and March 31, 2007, $797,000 was payable under the equipment loan agreement. The
proceeds from the equipment loan agreement were used for working capital.

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering as described above or otherwise,
we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing, investment
grade securities."

(1)As of May 15, 2007, approximately $235,000 of the offering expenses have 
already been paid, in part, from loans to us described below, including the
SEC registration fee, the NASD registration fee and legal and auditing fees.

(2) Represents 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the units in this 
offering.

(3)Represents 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the units in this 
offering that will be paid to the underwriters only upon consummation of a
business combination, less $0.28 for each share redeemed for cash in connection
with our business combination. If a business combination is not consummated and
we are liquidated, such amounts will be distributed among our public
stockholders.

(4)As described below, an entity affiliated with our executive officers and 
directors has agreed that, in the event the expenses of this offering are
greater than our estimates, it will make a loan to us in the amount (not to
exceed $250,000) necessary to ensure that $250,000 of net proceeds is initially
available to us outside the trust for working capital.

(5)These amounts are expected to be paid to legal, accounting and other outside
professional firms to assist in negotiating, structuring, and documenting a 
business combination and the preparation and filing of the related proxy 
statement.

$59,150,000, or $67,835,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds, including the proceeds of the private
placement, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bank
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. Of this amount, $2,100,000 ($2,415,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters if
and only if a business combination is consummated, less $0.28 for each share
redeemed for cash in connection with our business combination. Except as set
forth below, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination and our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any funds held for the benefit
of the underwriters or used to pay stockholders who exercised their redemption
rights) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business
with which we ultimately complete a business combination. However, we may not
use all of the funds remaining in the trust account in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In
that event, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any
other net proceeds not expended, will constitute working capital for our
business after the business combination and will be available for use as
determined by our board of directors at that time. While it is difficult to
determine what the specific operating expenses of our business after completion
of a business combination may be, we expect that they may include some or all of
the following: capital expenditures, general ongoing expenses including overhead
and payroll, costs involved in expanding markets and in developing strategic
acquisitions or alliances. In addition, we may use any remaining proceeds held
in the trust account to satisfy any unpaid reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our officers and directors in connection with identifying or
completing the business combination, as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or
similar fees or compensation to the extent such expenses, fees, or compensation
exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account.

Under the terms of our investment management trust agreement we are permitted,
at our discretion, from time to time as interest is earned and funds become
available, to draw the following amounts from the interest accrued on the trust
account: (i) taxes payable on interest earned, and (ii) up to $2,000,000 to fund
our working capital. The remaining proceeds held in trust will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business
combination or the liquidation of the trust account as part of any plan of
dissolution and liquidation approved by our stockholders.

We have agreed to pay Arcade Partners, LLC, a company equally owned by our
executive officers and directors, $7,500 per month for office space and general
and administrative services. We believe that such fee is at least as favorable
as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a
business combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay
these monthly fees.

We intend to use the excess working capital shown above for director and officer
liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the
event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

To the extent that our securities are used in whole or in part as consideration
to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account as well
as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the operations of
the target business.

Arcade Partners, LLC, a company equally owned by Messrs. Furer, Chapman and
Rahman, our executive officers and directors, has funded us an aggregate amount
of $225,000 pursuant to promissory notes. The proceeds of the loans evidenced by
the notes are being used to pay a portion of the expenses related to this 
offering. The notes bear simple interest at the rate of 4% per annum with both 
interest and principal being due and payable on the earlier of February 5, 2008
or the consummation of this offering.

In addition, Arcade Partners, LLC has agreed that, in the event the expenses of
this offering are greater than our estimates, upon the closing of the offering
it will make a loan to us in the amount (not to exceed $250,000) necessary to
ensure that $250,000 of working capital is initially available to us outside the
trust.  Such loan will be non-interest bearing and will be repaid only in the
event we consummate a business combination.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above, should we choose to hold
such amounts in a non-cash form, will be invested only in U.S. “government
securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the U.S. having a maturity
of 180 days or less so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. Up to $2,000,000 of the interest income, net of
taxes, derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period may be
used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as to pay costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We may use a portion of the working capital, including any interest released to
us from the trust account, to make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no shop”
provision with respect to a business combination, although we do not have any
current intention to do so. If we are ultimately required to forfeit such funds,
we would have less funds available to us to conduct due diligence and pay other
expenses related to finding another suitable business combination without
borrowing funds. If we were unable to secure additional financing, we would most
likely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and would
be forced to liquidate.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative fees described above,
no compensation will be paid to any of our officers and directors, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations and
for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this offering.
Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in
trust and currently allocated in the above table “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance and reserves.” In addition, reimbursement
for such expenses will also be paid by us out of the interest on funds held in
the trust account and distributable to us each calendar month. To the extent
that such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in
the trust account or other funds available to us, such out-of-pocket expenses
would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination, in
which event this reimbursement obligation would in all likelihood be negotiated
with the owners of a target business. Since the role of present management after
a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account not
previously released to us) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure
to complete a business combination within the allotted time or if that public
stockholder were to seek to redeem such shares for cash in connection with a
business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we
actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

——————
(1) Approximately $155,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration
fee, the NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock
Exchange filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
from the advances made by Columbus Acquisition Holdings LLC and sale of stock to
the initial stockholders. These advances will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are
reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of the
offering. An additional $3,000,000, or $3,450,000 if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited in trust following the
consummation of the offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and when we
consummate a business combination.

(3) The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain
constant at $50,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, an
aggregate of up to $1,750,000 of interest income earned on the amounts held in
the trust account will be released to us from time to time upon our written
request to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target
business and other working capital requirements. For purposes of presentation, 
the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds 
available to us immediately following the offering.

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Columbus Acquisition
Holdings LLC, our principal initial stockholder, has committed to invest
$3,650,000 in us by acquiring the insider warrants. This purchase will take
place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this
offering. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the
purchase of the insider warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this
purchase will be placed in the trust fund described below.

$95,350,000, or $109,750,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $3,650,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Morgan
Stanley, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as
trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts and
commissions, including the non-accountable expense allowance, payable to the
underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have agreed that such amount
will not be paid unless and until we consummate a business combination and have
waived their right to receive such payment upon our liquidation if we are unable
to complete a business combination. The funds held in trust will be invested
only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed
to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with
respect to interest income that may be released to us from time to time upon our
request of (i) up to $1,750,000 to fund our expenses related to investigating
and selecting a target business and our other working capital requirements and
(ii) any additional amounts we may need to pay our income or other tax
obligations, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Renova U.S. Management LLC of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. Renova U.S. Management LLC is a limited liability company
controlled by Andrew Intrater, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer. Mr. Intrater owns 63.4%, Jason Epstein and Michael Sloan, our Senior
Vice Presidents, each own 7.3% and Jay M. Haft owns 22% of the membership
interests of Renova U.S. Management LLC. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Renova U.S. Management LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr.
Intrater or any other member of our management team with compensation in lieu of
a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the New
York City metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Renova U.S. Management LLC
is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.
This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the
$7,500 per month administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review and approve all
expense reimbursements made to members of our management team and any expense
reimbursements payable to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and
approved by our board of directors, with any interested director abstaining from
such review and approval. There is no limit on the total amount of these
out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us, and there will be no review of the
reasonableness of the expenses other than by our audit committee and, in some
cases, by our board of directors as described above, or if such reimbursement is
challenged, by a court of competent jurisdiction. Reimbursement for such
expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently
allocated to “Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the due
diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business
combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses” and “Working
capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, and general corporate purposes,
dissolution obligations and reserves.” To the extent such out-of-pocket expenses
exceed the available funds not held in trust and the interest income of up to
$1,750,000 earned on the funds held in the trust account, such out-of-pocket
expenses will not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $50,000. In addition, interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account of up to $1,750,000 may be released to us
from time to time upon our request to fund our expenses relating to
investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital
requirements. These funds will be used by us for director and officer liability
insurance premiums, due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations, as well as for reimbursement
of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in
connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We will also be
entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released
to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. We believe that these funds
will be sufficient to allow us to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that
a business combination is not consummated during that time.  However, we cannot
assure you that our estimates will be accurate. We may request the release of
such funds for a number of purposes that may not ultimately lead to a business
combination.  For instance, we could use a portion of the funds available to us
to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business.
We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, or enter into a letter of intent where
we pay for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, where we may
be required to forfeit funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise).
In any of these cases, or in other situations where we expend the funds
available to us outside of the trust account for purposes that do not result i n
a business combination, we may not have sufficient remaining funds to continue
searching for, or to conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business,
in which case we would be forced to obtain alternative financing or liquidate.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States “government
securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

The allocation of net proceeds not held in trust and amounts available from the
interest income earned on the trust fund represents our best estimate of the
intended uses of these funds. We do not expect to use such amounts for anything
other than the purposes stated above. However, management may be required to pay
a different amount than the amount indicated in the table above for legal,
accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the due diligence
investigation, structuring and negotiation of a business combination, depending
upon the level of complexity of such business combination. The difference, if
any, will be allocated to, or deducted from, our working capital. We do not
expect any material variation between the amounts allocated to the other
categories under the heading “Use of net proceeds not held in trust and amounts
available from interest income earned on the trust fund” in the table above and
the amounts th at we will actually use for the purposes specified in those
categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business including for maintenance or expansion of
operation of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination or to
fund the purchase of other companies.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Columbus Acquisition Holdings LLC has agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek
repayment of such expenses.

Columbus Acquisition Holdings LLC has advanced to us a total of $143,000, which
was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the
earlier of June 30, 2007 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will 
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of 
offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

common stock in this offering, based on the initial public offering price of
$26.00 per share, will be approximately $81.5 million, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

    We plan to use these net proceeds to fund the expansion of our business into
new regions and expand our customer base, to finance research and development,
to fund cash consideration for future acquisitions and for other general
corporate purposes. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements
to acquire any businesses or technologies. We will not receive any proceeds from
the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

    We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to us to repay some or all of
our outstanding borrowings under our loan and security agreement with Bluecrest
Capital, though we have not determined if we will do so at this time. Borrowings
under our loan and security agreement currently bear interest at (a) the greater
of 5.22% or the yield on three-year U.S. Treasury Notes on the date of the loan
plus (b) in the case of our term loans, 655 basis points per annum, and in the
case of our equipment loans, 695 basis points per annum. Our loan and security
agreement provides for a term loan facility and an equipment term loan facility.
The initial $5.0 million we borrowed under the term loan facility matures on a
36 month amortization schedule, beginning on April 1, 2007. The $2.5 million we
borrowed on March 20, 2007 will mature on a 36 month amortization schedule.

made in connection with demand response sales and service agreements or other
similar agreements, or that are made in connection with demand response sales
and service contracts with Connecticut Light and Power Company, will mature on a
36 month amortization schedule from the date of the relevant borrowing.

according to the following priority of use: repayment of $12.0 million under our
revolving credit facility, working capital and other general corporate purposes
(including financing the development of new offerings), sales and marketing
activities, and capital expenditures. We may use a portion of the net proceeds
to us to expand our current business through acquisitions of other businesses,
products and technologies. In view of our existing cash balances and
availability of our existing revolving line of credit, a substantial reduction
in the amount of proceeds from the amount shown above would not have a
significant effect upon our planned expenditures.

    At our option, the revolving credit facility bears interest at either the
lender's prime rate less 1.00% or the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR,
plus 1.50%. Our revolving credit facility matures on August 30, 2011. We
borrowed against our revolving credit facility to partially fund the acquisition

selling in this offering will be approximately $78.6 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

On October 1, 2006, we repurchased 50.0% of our then-outstanding common stock
from Interpool. In connection with this transaction, we incurred $80.5 million
of indebtedness, $37.5 million of which was pursuant to a convertible
subordinated note we issued to Interpool and the remainder of which was pursuant
to borrowings under the revolving line of credit portion of our senior secured
credit facility. Of this indebtedness, $77.5 million of the indebtedness was
incurred to pay the purchase price for the common stock and $3.0 million was
used to repay a subordinated note we had previously issued to Interpool.

We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering in the following manner:

      •    approximately $37.5 million to repay the convertible subordinated note  
           issued to Interpool;

           senior secured credit facility; and                                     

      •    the remainder to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the    
           revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facility.      

The $37.5 million note issued to Interpool bears interest at a rate of 7.87% per
year for the first six months. Thereafter, the interest rate will increase by
1.00% for each six-month period that the principal amount of such note remains
outstanding. The convertible subordinated note is due and payable on
October 30, 2010. For additional information on this note, see “Certain
Relationships and Related-Party Transactions.”

We borrowed $20.0 million under the term loan portion of our senior secured
credit facility on October 2, 2006 to pay part of the cash portion of the
purchase price payable to Interpool in connection with our repurchase of all of
our common stock held by Interpool and our repayment of the remaining principal
and interest on a subordinated note we had previously issued to Interpool. The
term loan bears interest at variable rates based on the Eurodollar rate or a
base rate described in our senior secured credit facility plus a margin that
changes depending on certain financial criteria. The term loan is due and
payable on September 30, 2010. As of March 31, 2007, the interest rate on the
term loan was 7.57%.

In addition, we borrowed $23.0 million under the revolving line of credit
portion of our senior secured credit facility on October 2, 2006 to pay part of
the cash portion of the purchase price payable to Interpool in connection with
our repurchase of all of our common stock held by Interpool. The revolving line
of credit bears interest at variable rates based on the Eurodollar rate or a
base rate described in our senior secured credit facility plus a margin that
changes depending on certain financial criteria. The amounts outstanding under
the revolving line of credit are due and payable on September 30, 2010. As of
March 31, 2007, the interest rate on the amount outstanding under the revolving
line of credit was 7.32%."

public offering price of $15.50 per share, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. The

We will use all of the net proceeds from this offering to:
 
    •  redeem $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 11% senior          
       subordinated notes, due January 15, 2014 for an aggregate redemption price,

As of March 31, 2007, we owed $255.5 million under our first lien term loan and
$55.0 million under our first lien revolving credit facility. Borrowings under
these facilities bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount at a
rate equal to an applicable margin (as described below) plus, at our option,
either:
 
    •  a base rate determined by reference to the higher of the prime rate        
       announced by Credit Suisse and the federal funds rate plus one-half of

Prior to January 31, 2007, for term loans the applicable margin was 1.75% for
base rate loans and 2.75% for Eurodollar rate loans. For revolving loans the
applicable margin ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% for base rate loans and 2.00% to
2.75% for Eurodollar loans, in each case based on our consolidated leverage
ratio. Loans under the swing line subfacility bear interest at the rate
applicable to base rate loans under the revolving credit facility. For the first
three months of 2007, the average interest rate applicable to term loans and
Eurodollar rate term loans was 9.5% and 7.8%, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 2006, the average interest rate applicable to term loans and
Eurodollar rate term loans was 9.9% and 7.9%, respectively. For the first three
months of 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2006, the average interest
rate applicable to revolving loans was 8.7% and 9.6%, respectively. Effective
January 31, 2007, the applicable margin for term loans is 1.25% for base rate
loans and 2.25% for Eurodollar rate loans. Our first lien term loan matures on
June 15, 2012 and our revolving credit facility matures on June 15, 2010.
 
Onex and certain members of our management used borrowings from our 11% senior
subordinated notes and our first lien term loan to consummate the Transactions.

the underwriters of this offering or their affiliates are or may become holders
of our 11% senior subordinated notes and as such will receive a portion of the

expect to have sufficient funding from the proceeds of this offering to

candidates. We have no current plans, agreements or commitments for any material

corresponding number of stock units. Such net proceeds will be retained in the
trust and will be invested to match the investment elections made by such
employee. Since the plan units are currently included in our total shares
outstanding and the number of newly issued shares equals the number of plan
units deducted from employee plan accounts, this diversification has no net
impact on our total shares outstanding.

    We expect to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes,
which may include future acquisitions.

       The primary purposes of this offering are to:

             º diversify the ownership of IBG LLC's business;

             º raise IBG LLC's profile for competitive reasons;

       We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to purchase membership
interests in IBG LLC from IBG Holdings LLC representing approximately 10.0% of
the outstanding membership interests in IBG LLC. The number of membership
interests in IBG LLC to be purchased from IBG Holdings LLC and the purchase
price for each membership interest corresponds to the number of shares of common

           sales platforms, such as dedicated TV home shopping channels, catalog

market for our ordinary shares represented by the ADSs for the benefit of our
shareholders. We do not currently have any agreements or understandings to make
any material acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses.

immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds
in short-term, interest bearing, debt instruments or bank deposits. These
investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a
passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which
could result in negative tax consequences for you."

approximately $133.8 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, based on the initial
public offering price of $12.00 per share.

We intend to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering primarily
for the following purposes:

†  approximately $44 million to repay shareholder loans to Xing. The shareholder  
   loans from Xing were unsecured, non-interest bearing and had no fixed repayment
   terms. $38.0 million of such loans were incurred in 2006, of which             
   $18.8 million was used as a capital injection into CECT in July 2006 and the   
   balance was loaned to us for working capital purposes; and                     
  
†  approximately $80 million to make loans or capital contributions to CECT, of   
   which (i) approximately $60 million will be used to fund our working capital   
   requirements in connection with our planned capacity expansion and             
   (ii) approximately $20 million will be used to purchase equipment for our new  
   manufacturing facility in Huizhou.                                           

We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for other general corporate purposes
and for potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses and
technologies that we believe will complement our current operations and our
expansion strategies. We do not currently have any agreements or understandings
with third parties to make any material acquisitions of, or investments in,
other businesses.

Depending on future events and other changes in the business climate, we may
determine at a later time to use the net proceeds for different purposes.
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds to us in short-term
bank deposits, direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government or other
short-term money market instruments.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares by the
selling shareholders."

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, based on
the initial public offering price of $11.00 per share and after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $44.8 million.

The principal purposes for this offering are to fund our development activities,
including clinical trials for NGX-4010 and our other potential product
candidates, to increase our working capital, to create a public market for our
common stock, to increase our ability to access the capital markets in the
future, for general corporate purposes and to provide liquidity for our existing
stockholders.

We intend to use approximately $35.0 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to fund research and development activities, including approximately
$25.0 million for the completion of our planned clinical and regulatory program
for NGX-4010 in PHN and HIV-DSP, $8.0 million for clinical development of
NGX-4010 in PDN through at least one Phase 3 trial and $2.0 million for
development of our new product candidate NGX-1998 into a Phase 2 trial and for
pre-clinical research of other potential product candidates. We anticipate using
the remaining proceeds of this offering to fund general and administrative
activities.
 
We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary businesses or products or to obtain rights to such complementary
technologies. We have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or
investments.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress in, and costs of, our clinical programs and the
amount and timing of revenues, if any, from our current or future
collaborations. We therefore cannot estimate the amount of net proceeds to be
used for all of the purposes described above. We may find it necessary or
advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described
above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities."

commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering to pay in full the
principal amount outstanding under our term loan agreement with Silicon Valley
Bank and Gold Hill Ventures 03 LP. As of March 31, 2007, the principal amount
outstanding was $3.6 million. Currently, the loan has an interest rate equal to
10.5% per annum and has a maturity date of June 1, 2009. We used the proceeds of
this loan for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
 
We also intend to use our net proceeds from this offering to pay an obligation
under a license agreement of $1.9 million, which becomes due in connection with
the automatic two-year extension of the license as a result of this offering.
 
We also intend to use our net proceeds from this offering for working capital
and other general corporate purposes.
 
We may also use a portion of the proceeds to expand our current business through
acquisitions of or investments in other complementary businesses, products or
technologies. However, we have no negotiations, agreements or commitments with
respect to any acquisitions at this time.
 
Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a
variety of short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

(1)   Approximately $84,410 of the offering expenses, including the SEC           
      registration fee, the NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the    
      American Stock Exchange filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit     
      fees, have been or will be paid from the funds we received from             
      Messrs. Leight and Weiss described below. These funds will be repaid out of 
      the proceeds of this offering available to us.                              


 
(2)   No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
      insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts  
      are reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of
      the offering. An additional $10,800,000, or $12,420,000 if the              
      over-allotment option is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited  
      in trust following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the      
      underwriters only if and when we consummate a business combination.         

(3)   The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $200,000   
      even if the over-allotment option is exercised. In addition, $3,100,000 of  
      interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be     
      available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of
      presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount  
      of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.         
   
(4)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these  
      items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may   
      incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in   
      connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based    
      upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not        
      anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than           
      fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
      fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
      category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.    


 
In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Nathan Leight and Jason
Weiss have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase
price of $3,000,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a private
placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will
not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider
warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in
the trust account described below.
 
$344,660,000, or $396,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $3,000,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Wells Fargo,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts and
commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have
agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The funds
held in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Except with respect to interest income that may be released to us
of (i) up to $3,100,000 to fund expenses related to investigating and selecting
a target business and our other working capital requirements and (ii) any
additional amounts we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations, the
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.
 
The payment to Terrapin Partners LLC, an affiliate of Nathan Leight, our
chairman of the board, and Jason Weiss, our chief executive officer, of a
monthly fee of $7,500 is for certain administrative, technology and secretarial
services, as well as the use of certain limited office space, including a
conference room, in New York City. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Terrapin Partners LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide
Messrs. Leight and Weiss compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the New York City metropolitan area, that
the fee charged by Terrapin Partners LLC is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of a business combination or the distribution of the trust account to
our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of
any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to
any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their
affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate,
the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as searching for and identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations or meet
with their representatives or owners. Reimbursement for such expenses will be
paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to “Legal,
accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the search for target
businesses and to the due diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation
of a business combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses by
our officers, directors and existing stockholders” and “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation
obligations and reserves.” Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.
 
Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $200,000. In addition, interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $3,100,000, may be released
to us to fund our working capital requirements. We will also be entitled to have
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any
tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $1,670,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $120,000), with the balance of $1,550,000 being held in reserve
in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring
and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
believe these funds will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and
reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the funds not being placed in
trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a
“no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target
businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms
more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If
we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms
of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.
 
The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories.
 
We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. Additionally, while we are not obligated
to engage any of the underwriters to assist us with locating a target business
following this offering, we are not restricted from doing so. If we did, we may
pay a fee to them for their services for assisting us in locating a target
business. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or
finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business
combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust account were
insufficient to cover such expenses.
 
To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Nathan Leight and Jason Weiss have agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to
seek repayment of such expenses.
 
Nathan Leight, our chairman of the board, and Jason Weiss, our chief executive
officer, has each advanced to us $62,500 (for a total of $125,000) which was
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the
earlier of February 27, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loans 
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment
of offering expenses.
 
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account.
 
Upon the consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters will
be entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust account
attributable to the underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust
account."

(1)   Approximately $84,410 of the offering expenses, including the SEC           
      registration fee, the NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the    
      American Stock Exchange filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit     
      fees, have been or will be paid from the funds we received from             
      Messrs. Leight and Weiss described below. These funds will be repaid out of 
      the proceeds of this offering available to us.                              


 
(2)   No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
      insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts  
      are reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of
      the offering. An additional $10,800,000, or $12,420,000 if the              
      over-allotment option is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited  
      in trust following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the      
      underwriters only if and when we consummate a business combination.         

(3)   The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $200,000   
      even if the over-allotment option is exercised. In addition, $3,100,000 of  
      interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be     
      available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of
      presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount  
      of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.         
   
(4)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these  
      items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may   
      incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in   
      connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based    
      upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not        
      anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than           
      fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
      fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
      category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.    


 
In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Nathan Leight and Jason
Weiss have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase
price of $3,000,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a private
placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will
not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider
warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in
the trust account described below.
 
$344,660,000, or $396,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $3,000,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Wells Fargo,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts and
commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have
agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The funds
held in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Except with respect to interest income that may be released to us
of (i) up to $3,100,000 to fund expenses related to investigating and selecting
a target business and our other working capital requirements and (ii) any
additional amounts we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations, the
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.
 
The payment to Terrapin Partners LLC, an affiliate of Nathan Leight, our
chairman of the board, and Jason Weiss, our chief executive officer, of a
monthly fee of $7,500 is for certain administrative, technology and secretarial
services, as well as the use of certain limited office space, including a
conference room, in New York City. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Terrapin Partners LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide
Messrs. Leight and Weiss compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the New York City metropolitan area, that
the fee charged by Terrapin Partners LLC is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of a business combination or the distribution of the trust account to
our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of
any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to
any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their
affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate,
the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as searching for and identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations or meet
with their representatives or owners. Reimbursement for such expenses will be
paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to “Legal,
accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the search for target
businesses and to the due diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation
of a business combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses by
our officers, directors and existing stockholders” and “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation
obligations and reserves.” Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.
 
Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $200,000. In addition, interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $3,100,000, may be released
to us to fund our working capital requirements. We will also be entitled to have
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any
tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $1,670,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $120,000), with the balance of $1,550,000 being held in reserve
in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring
and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
believe these funds will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and
reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the funds not being placed in
trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a
“no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target
businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms
more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If
we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms
of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.
 
The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories.
 
We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. Additionally, while we are not obligated
to engage any of the underwriters to assist us with locating a target business
following this offering, we are not restricted from doing so. If we did, we may
pay a fee to them for their services for assisting us in locating a target
business. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or
finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business
combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust account were
insufficient to cover such expenses.
 
To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Nathan Leight and Jason Weiss have agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to
seek repayment of such expenses.
 
Nathan Leight, our chairman of the board, and Jason Weiss, our chief executive
officer, has each advanced to us $62,500 (for a total of $125,000) which was
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the
earlier of February 27, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loans 
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment
of offering expenses.
 
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account.
 
Upon the consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters will
be entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust account
attributable to the underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust
account."

(1)   Approximately $84,410 of the offering expenses, including the SEC           
      registration fee, the NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the    
      American Stock Exchange filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit     
      fees, have been or will be paid from the funds we received from             
      Messrs. Leight and Weiss described below. These funds will be repaid out of 
      the proceeds of this offering available to us.                              


 
(2)   No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
      insider warrants. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts  
      are reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of
      the offering. An additional $10,800,000, or $12,420,000 if the              
      over-allotment option is exercised in full, all of which will be deposited  
      in trust following the consummation of the offering, is payable to the      
      underwriters only if and when we consummate a business combination.         

(3)   The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $200,000   
      even if the over-allotment option is exercised. In addition, $3,100,000 of  
      interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be     
      available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of
      presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount  
      of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering.         
   
(4)   These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these  
      items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may   
      incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in   
      connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based    
      upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not        
      anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than           
      fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
      fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
      category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.    


 
In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Nathan Leight and Jason
Weiss have committed to purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase
price of $3,000,000) from us. These purchases will take place on a private
placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will
not pay any discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider
warrants. All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in
the trust account described below.
 
$344,660,000, or $396,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $3,000,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Wells Fargo,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts and
commissions payable to the underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have
agreed that such amount will not be paid unless and until we consummate a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The funds
held in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Except with respect to interest income that may be released to us
of (i) up to $3,100,000 to fund expenses related to investigating and selecting
a target business and our other working capital requirements and (ii) any
additional amounts we may need to pay our income or other tax obligations, the
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.
 
The payment to Terrapin Partners LLC, an affiliate of Nathan Leight, our
chairman of the board, and Jason Weiss, our chief executive officer, of a
monthly fee of $7,500 is for certain administrative, technology and secretarial
services, as well as the use of certain limited office space, including a
conference room, in New York City. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Terrapin Partners LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide
Messrs. Leight and Weiss compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on
rents and fees for similar services in the New York City metropolitan area, that
the fee charged by Terrapin Partners LLC is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of a business combination or the distribution of the trust account to
our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of
any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to
any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their
affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate,
the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as searching for and identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations or meet
with their representatives or owners. Reimbursement for such expenses will be
paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to “Legal,
accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the search for target
businesses and to the due diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation
of a business combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses by
our officers, directors and existing stockholders” and “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, general corporate purposes, liquidation
obligations and reserves.” Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.
 
Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $200,000. In addition, interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $3,100,000, may be released
to us to fund our working capital requirements. We will also be entitled to have
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any
tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $1,670,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $120,000), with the balance of $1,550,000 being held in reserve
in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring
and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
believe these funds will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and
reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the funds not being placed in
trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a
“no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target
businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms
more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If
we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms
of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.
 
The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories.
 
We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. Additionally, while we are not obligated
to engage any of the underwriters to assist us with locating a target business
following this offering, we are not restricted from doing so. If we did, we may
pay a fee to them for their services for assisting us in locating a target
business. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or
finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business
combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust account were
insufficient to cover such expenses.
 
To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Nathan Leight and Jason Weiss have agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to
seek repayment of such expenses.
 
Nathan Leight, our chairman of the board, and Jason Weiss, our chief executive
officer, has each advanced to us $62,500 (for a total of $125,000) which was
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the
earlier of February 27, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loans 
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment
of offering expenses.
 
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account.
 
Upon the consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters will
be entitled to receive the portion of the proceeds held in the trust account
attributable to the underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust
account."

(1)Approximately $107,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration
fee, the NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock
Exchange filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
from the funds we received from Messrs. Schriesheim, Weksel, Davies, and Weksel
described below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering
available to us.

(2)No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
insider warrants. Of the 7% underwriting discount, (i) if the over-allotment
option is not exercised, 4% will be payable at closing of this offering and 3%
will be payable upon consummation of a business combination and (ii) if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full at the initial closing, approximately
3.722% will be payable at closing of this offering and approximately 3.278% will
be payable upon consummation of a business combination. The non-accountable
expense allowance will also be payable only upon consummation of a business
combination. If the over-allotment option is exercised other than in full,
whether at the initial closing or after, the underwriters have agreed to defer
such amount as is required to keep the per-share trust amount at approximately
$7.85 per share. For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts are
reflected as the amount payable to the underwriters upon consummation of the
offering. An additional $1,680,000 or $2,111,256 if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of the underwriting discount and $560,000 representing the
non-accountable expense allowance, whether or not the over-allotment option is
exercised, all of which will be deposited in trust following the consummation of
the offering, is payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a
business combination.

(3)The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain
constant at $100,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition,
$1,680,000 of interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account
will be available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. This does
not include additional amounts that may be released to us to pay for our tax
obligations. For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is
shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following
the offering.

(4)The amount of net proceeds from this offering held in trust includes 3% (or
approximately 3.278% if the over-allotment option is exercised) of underwriting
discounts and the 1% non-accountable expense allowance that are deferred and
only payable to the underwriters upon consummation of a business combination.

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Robert A. Schriesheim,
Dr. William Weksel, Robert H. Davies, Michael E. Weksel, Paul Levy, Ira
Hollenberg IRA, Silverman Realty Group, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (LCPSP),
Norbert W. Strauss, David Strauss and Jonathan Strauss have committed to
purchase the insider warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $1,820,000)
from us. These purchases will take place on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will not pay any
discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider warrants.
All of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in the trust
fund described below.

$53,135,000, or $61,378,250 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,820,000 we will receive from the
sale of the insider warrants, will be placed in a trust account at Smith Barney,
a division of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes a
portion of the underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the
underwriters in this offering. The underwriters have agreed that such amount
will not be paid unless and until we consummate a business combination and have
waived their right to receive such payment upon our liquidation if we are unable
to complete a business combination. The funds held in trust will be invested
only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed
to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with
respect to interest income that may be released to us of (i) up to $1,680,000 to
fund expenses related to investigating and selecting a target business and our
other working capital requirements and (ii) any additional amounts we may need
to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds held in trust will not
be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or
any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to
“Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the due diligence
investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business combination,” “Due
diligence of prospective target businesses” and “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance and reserves.” Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $100,000. In addition, interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account, up to $1,680,000, may be released
to us to fund our working capital requirements. Assuming an interest rate of
4.92%, we anticipate that the full $1,680,000 of interest income that may be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements during the entire 24
month period following the consummation of this offering, plus any necessary 
amount we would need for our tax obligations, would be available. These funds 
will be used by us for director and officer liability insurance premiums, due 
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating 
business combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on 
our behalf as described above. We will also be entitled to have interest earned 
on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any tax obligations
that we may owe. We believe these funds will be sufficient to cover the 
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could also use a portion of these
funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target 
business or to use as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a 
provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from 
“shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable 
to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business 
combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we 
entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive 
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down 
payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms 
of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at 
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or 
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the
completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of
the trust fund were insufficient to cover such expenses.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, certain of our initial stockholders have agreed
to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to
seek repayment of such expenses.

Robert A. Schriesheim, our chairman of the board, Dr. William Weksel, our chief
executive officer, Robert H. Davies, our chief strategist, and Michael E.
Weksel, our chief operating officer, chief financial officer, secretary and
director, has each advanced to us $37,500 (for a total of $150,000) which was
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, the non-refundable
portion of the American Stock Exchange listing fee, and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the
earlier of September 1, 2007 or the consummation of this offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment
of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

be approximately $14,305,000 (approximately $16,390,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full), based upon an estimated initial
public offering price of $5.50 per share and after deducting the estimated
underwriting discount, the non-accountable expense allowance and the estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

                                                                Amount

Payment of cash portion in connection with the
acquisition of Objectware, together with expenses
associated with that acquisition                                      3,305            23.1 %
Other potential acquisitions (approximate)                            2,000            14.0 %

Total                                                       $        14,305           100.0 %

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the results of our sales, marketing activities, competition
and the amount of cash generated or used by our operations. For example, in the
event that we do not complete the acquisition of Objectware, we intend to use
the remainder of our net proceeds to finance our working capital needs, which
may include (without limitation) funding research and development initiatives,
capital equipment expenditures, marketing activities and increases to sales and
administrative staff, and for general corporate purposes. We may, however,
change these anticipated uses as we deem appropriate. Although we currently have
no agreements or commitments to complete any acquisitions or other such
transactions other than the Objectware acquisition and have not allocated funds
in our business plan for any specific acquisitions, we believe that the proceeds
from this offering will enable us to more effectively pursue strategic
opportunities when and as we identify them. We currently estimate that we will
use approximately $2,000,000 of the net proceeds to make other acquisitions that
may be identified in the future. Based on our acquisition criteria and the
portion of the purchase price of each acquisition that we expect to pay in cash
at the closing, we believe that amount will be sufficient to fund the initial
costs of our acquisitions over the next several years, after which we believe

that cash from operations will be sufficient to fund the cash payments expected
to be made upon the closing of any subsequent acquisitions. We may find it
necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will
have broad discretion in the application of the balance of the net proceeds.
Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
certificates of deposit, short-term obligations of the United States government,
or other money-market instruments that are rated investment grade or its
equivalent."

approximately $265.4 million after deducting the underwriting discount and
estimated offering expenses of $19.6 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase our 101/2%
senior discount notes due 2012 in connection with the tender offer of the notes
and to pay transaction expenses. The accreted value of the discount notes at
March 31, 2007 was $257.3 million. We estimate that the premiums and other costs
that will be paid in connection with the purchase will be approximately
$31.1 million. We may purchase in the open market any notes not purchased in the

general corporate purposes, repay indebtedness, establish a public market for
our common stock and facilitate our future access to public capital markets. We
will have broad discretion in the way we use the net proceeds to us; however, we

   º The amounts set forth in this table are approximate.

   º (1) To partially finance the payment of a one-time cash dividend of
     $41.3 million to our stockholders, we incurred $20.0 million of
     indebtedness in March 2007. By its terms, this indebtedness becomes due in
     full upon the closing of this offering and would otherwise be due and
     payable in March 2012. The indebtedness bears interest at a base rate or
     Eurodollar rate, at our option, plus a margin of 1.50% for base rate
     borrowings and 2.75% for Eurodollar rate borrowings.

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

common stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately
$73.7 million, based on the initial public offering price of $16.50 per share
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from any sale of shares of our common
stock by the selling stockholders.
 
The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets,
as well as to obtain additional capital.
 
Except as discussed below, we currently have no specific plans for the use of a
significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering. However, we anticipate
that we will use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, other
corporate expenses and acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or

capital expenditures related to computer hardware and equipment as well as
office improvements. We currently have no agreements or commitments with respect
to acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses. The
timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business.
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering
primarily in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

$206.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts but before paying expenses
associated with the offering and related formation transactions and structuring
fees of approximately $550,000 to be paid to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and
Lehman Brothers Inc. for evaluation, analysis and structuring of our
partnership. We anticipate using the aggregate net proceeds of this offering to:
 
    •  purchase approximately $163.1 million of qualifying investment grade       
       securities, which will be assigned as collateral to secure the term loan   
       portion of our credit facility;

       reimbursement for capital expenditures incurred by subsidiaries of Spectra 
       Energy prior to this offering related to the assets to be contributed to us
       upon the closing of this offering, which distribution will be made in

We have entered into a $500 million credit facility under which we expect to
borrow approximately $163.1 million in term debt and $125 million in revolving
debt upon the closing of this offering. We will distribute the aggregate amount
of the proceeds of such borrowings to subsidiaries of Spectra Energy, which
distribution will be made in partial consideration of the assets contributed to
us upon the closing of this offering. Please see “Certain Relationships and
Related Party Transactions — Distributions and Payments to our General Partner
and its Affiliates.”
 
The qualifying securities we will purchase will be assigned as collateral to
secure the term loan borrowings. The interest we receive from our ownership of
these securities will partially offset our cost of borrowings under the term
loan facility. Please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Requirements — Description of
Credit Agreement.”
 
If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units is exercised in
full, we will (1) use the net proceeds of approximately $30.9 million from the
sale of these additional securities to purchase an equivalent amount of
qualifying investment grade securities and (2) borrow an additional amount of
term debt equal to the net proceeds to be received from the exercise of the
underwriters’ option. The qualifying securities purchased will be assigned as
collateral to secure such additional term loan borrowings. The proceeds of the
additional term loan borrowings will be used to redeem from a subsidiary of
Spectra Energy a number of common units equal to the number of common units
issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ option, at a price per common unit
equal to the proceeds per common unit before expenses but after underwriting
discounts and a structuring fee."

The principal reasons for this offering are to create a public market for our

exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units.

    In addition, our proceeds from the sale of non-voting common units to the
State Investment Company will be approximately $3.0 billion.

    We intend to use approximately $3.98 billion of the proceeds from this

Company, or approximately $4.57 billion if the underwriters exercise in full
their option to purchase additional common units, to purchase interests in our
business from our existing owners, including certain members of our senior
management. Accordingly, we will not retain any of these proceeds. 

    We intend to use all of the remaining proceeds from this offering and the
sale of non-voting common units to the State Investment Company, or
approximately $2.98 billion (before reduction for offering expenses of
approximately $50.0 million), to purchase newly-issued Blackstone Holdings
partnership units substantially currently with the consummation of this

$1.2 billion of these proceeds to repay short-term borrowings and the remainder:

securities hedge fund and our equity hedge fund.

    Our revolving credit facility is a $1.35 billion revolving credit facility
that matures on February 1, 2012. As of March 31, 2007, we had outstanding
borrowings of $577.0 million bearing interest at a weighted average rate of
6.1%. Proceeds from these borrowings have been used for working capital
purposes. We anticipate borrowing additional amounts under our revolving credit
facility to make distributions representing all of the undistributed earnings
generated by the Contributed Businesses prior to date of this offering. If the
offering had occurred on March 31, 2007, we estimate that the aggregate amount
of such borrowings would have been $610.4 million.

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $222.1 million

over-allotment option), in each case assuming an initial public offering price
of $16.00 per share, which is the mid-point of the price range set forth on the
cover of this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
of approximately $15.6 million (or approximately $17.9 million if the
underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option) and estimated offering
expenses of approximately $2.3 million payable by us. A $1.00 increase
(decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $16.00 per share
would increase (decrease) net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately
$14.0 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus remains the same, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We plan to use approximately $200.8 million of the net proceeds of this offering
to fund a portion of the purchase price for the contribution of the initial
assets to us, with the remainder of the net proceeds, if any, used for our
targeted investments and general corporate purposes. The total fair market value
of the initial assets purchased by us may increase between March 31, 2007 and
the closing of this offering as a result of accrued interest earned on the
initial assets. Accordingly, the cash portion of the consideration that we will
pay in exchange for the initial assets would be increased to reflect any
increase in the fair market value of the initial assets. In the event that our
Manager receives a prepayment of principal on any of the initial assets prior to
the closing of this offering, the total fair market value of the initial assets
will decrease and the cash portion of the consideration that we will pay in
exchange for the initial assets will be decreased to reflect the amount of any
such prepayments. Further, to the extent that the shares of common stock are
priced above or below $16.00 per share, the mid-point of the price range set
forth on the cover page of this prospectus, the cash portion of the
consideration that we will pay to CIT Holding in exchange for the initial assets
will also be adjusted accordingly. A $1.00 increase in the assumed initial
public offering price of $16.00 would decrease the cash portion of the
consideration paid by us to CIT Holding by approximately $5.3 million, assuming
the number of shares offered by us remains the same. Alternatively, a $1.00
decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $16.00 would increase
the cash portion of the consideration paid by us to CIT Holding by approximately
$5.3 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us remains the same."

(1)There is no placement fee paid or payable by us in connection with the sale of
the founder warrants. Prior to the closing of this offering, two of the
underwriters, CRT Capital Group LLC and I-Bankers Securities, Inc., will loan to
certain of the founders $500,000 to be used to purchase a portion of the founder
warrants. 

(2)M.O.T.A. Holdings Ltd., FSGL Holdings Ltd and OLEV Holdings Ltd have loaned us
an aggregate of $219,000 for the payment of a portion of the offering expenses
and have incurred an additional $120,930 of liabilities relating to this
offering. These non-interest bearing loans will be payable on the earlier of
September 14, 2007 and the consummation of this offering, unless we decide to
defer repayment based on our expected cash flow needs, in which case repayment
may be deferred for up to 12 months.

(3)The underwriters have agreed to defer this amount until the consummation of our
initial business combination. Upon the consummation of our initial business
combination, we will pay such deferred fees (less $0.30 for each share of common
stock converted to cash in connection with our initial business combination) to
the underwriters out of the proceeds of this offering held in a trust account at
Lehman Brothers Inc., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee.

(4)$380,000 of the proceeds of this offering will be held outside of the trust
account and available to us to fund our working capital requirements. In
addition, one-half of the interest earned on the trust account, net of taxes
payable on such interest, will be released to us to cover our working capital
requirements, up to a maximum of $2.0 million.

We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units and the founder
warrants to acquire a technology or technology-related business that has
operations or facilities located in Israel, or that intends to establish
operations or facilities in Israel, such as research and development,
manufacturing or executive offices, following our initial business combination.

Of the net proceeds we receive from our unit offering and the private placement
of the founder warrants, $144,125,000 of the net proceeds we receive from this
offering, plus the additional $3,625,000 we will receive from the sale of
founder warrants taking place simultaneously with the consummation of this
offering, totaling $147,750,000 ($7.88 per unit sold to the public in this
offering) will be deposited into a trust account at Lehman Brothers Inc.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in
the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Additionally,
although we have no present intention to do so, it is possible that we will in
the future find it nec essary or desirable to use a portion of the funds in the
trust account to make a down payment or deposit or fund a lock-up or ""no-shop""
provision, with respect to a potential business combination. If so, any such
amount would be based on the terms of the specific transaction and the amount of
available funds at the time. If we use a significant portion of our funds for
such a purpose and we are required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of
our breach of the agreement relating to the original payment or otherwise), we
could, if such payment was large enough and we had already used some or all of
the funds allocated to due diligence and related expenses in connection with the
aborted transaction, be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for,
or to conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential target businesses.
In that event, we may be required to liquidate before the completion of a
business combination.

Additionally, the proceeds held in the trust account will be used to pay the
underwriters a deferred fee equal to 3.75% of the gross proceeds of the unit
offering, or $5,625,000 less $0.30 for each share of common stock converted to
cash in connection with our initial business combination, upon the consummation
of our initial business combination; this portion of the proceeds held in the
trust account will not be available for our use to acquire an operating
business. We may use all of the remaining net proceeds of this offering held in
the trust account to acquire an operating business. However, we may choose not
to use all of the remaining proceeds in the trust account in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock, debt securities or bank
financing. In that event , the proceeds held in the trust account, as well as
any other net proceeds not expended, may be used to finance the operations of
the target business, which may include subsequent acquisitions.

We believe that prior to the consummation of a business combination, the
$380,000 of proceeds initially held outside of the trust account, as well as one
half of the interest earned on the trust account, net of taxes payable on such
interest, up to a maximum of $2.0 million, will be sufficient to cover our
operating expenses for the next 24 months and to cover the expenses incurred in
connection with a business combination. Assuming that a business combination is
not consummated during that time, we anticipate making the following
expenditures during this time period:

†approximately $1,380,000 of expenses for legal, accounting and other expenses
attendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiating of a
business combination, including without limitation third party fees for
assisting us in performing due diligence investigations of perspective target
businesses;

†approximately $300,000 of expenses in legal and accounting fees relating to our
SEC reporting obligations;

†approximately $240,000 of expenses in fees relating to our office space and
certain general and administrative services;

†approximately $460,000 for general working capital that will be used for
miscellaneous expenses, including reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our existing stockholders, directors and officers in connection with
activities on our behalf, of which approximately $400,000 is for director and
officer liability and other insurance premiums; and

†if we must dissolve and liquidate, $50,000 to $75,000 for dissolution and
liquidation costs.

These amounts are based on management's estimate of the amount needed to fund
our operations for the next 24 months and to consummate a business combination.
This estimate may prove inaccurate, especially if a portion of the available 
funds is used to make a down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in 
connection with a business combination or if we expend a significant portion of 
the available funds in pursuit of a business combination that is not 
consummated. Our assumptions about the interest earned on the funds in the trust
account are based in part on the Federal Reserve Statistical Release dated
April 30, 2007, which references historical interest rate data which appears on
the Federal Reserve website. According to the Federal Reserve Statistical
Release, U.S. Treasury Bills with four week, three month and six month
maturities were yielding, as of the week ending April 27, 2007, 4.83%, 4.85% and
4.84%, respectively. While we cannot assure you the balance of the trust account
will be invested to yield these rates, we believe such rates are representative
of those we may receive on the balance of the trust account. If we do not have
sufficient funds available to cover our expenses, we may be forced to obtain
additional financing, either from our existing stockholders, directors and
officers or third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional financing and
our existing stockholders, directors and officers are not obligated to provide
any additional financing. If we do not have sufficient funds and cannot find
additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate prior to consummating a
business combination. If we choose to obtain additional financing in order to
fund due diligence and other expenses associated with locating a target
business, and if such additional financing were in the form of a loan, such loan
would be incurred by us.

We expect that due diligence of a prospective target business will be performed
by some or all of our existing stockholders, directors and officers. None of our
existing stockholders, directors or officers will receive any compensation for
their due diligence efforts, other than reimbursement of any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while performing due
diligence of a prospective target business; provided, however, that we are
permitted to pay a finder's fee or other compensation to Shrem, Fudim, Kelner &
Co. Ltd. and/or to Shrem, Fudim, Kelner - Technologies Ltd. should they provide
us services prior to or in connection with a business combination. To date, our
existing stockholders, directors and officers have not performed due diligence
of any prospective target business. Any reimbursement of reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our discretion. To the extent such out-o
f-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate a business combination. In addition, we may opt to make a down
payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with structuring and
negotiating a business combination. We have not reserved any specific amounts
for a down payment, exclusivity fees, finder's fees or similar fees or
compensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses
and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used to finance the operations of the target business and to
pay finders' fees, if any.

In order to fund a business combination or any related due diligence, we may
choose to seek loans from third parties for some or all of such costs or the
consideration to be paid in such a transaction. These loans would be incurred by
the Company. None of our initial stockholders would be personally liable for the
repayment of such loans unless they specifically agreed to be so liable.

M.O.T.A. Holdings Ltd., FSGL Holdings Ltd and OLEV Holdings Ltd have loaned us
an aggregate of $219,000 for the payment of a portion of the offering expenses
and have incurred an additional $120,930 of liabilities relating to this
offering. These non-interest bearing loans will be payable on the earlier of
September 14, 2007 and the consummation of this offering, unless we decide to
defer repayment based on our expected cash flow needs, in which case repayment
may be deferred for up to 12 months.

We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of $10,000 to LMS Nihul, an affiliate of
M.O.T.A. Holdings Ltd., FSGL Holdings Ltd and OLEV Holdings Ltd, three of our
initial stockholders, for general and administrative services including office
space, utilities and secretarial support. We believe, based on rents and fees
for similar services in Israel, that the fee charged by LMS Nihul is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party.

The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in U.S. ""government securities,""
defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United States government having a
maturity of 180 days or less, or any open ended investment company registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that holds itself out as a money market
fund and bears the highest credit rating issued by a United States nationally
recognized rating agency. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these
instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in
Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are 
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
The interest income earned on investment of the net proceeds not held in trust 
during this period, net of taxes payable on such interest, as well as one-half 
of the interest earned on the trust account, net of taxes payable on such 
interest, up to a maximum of $2.0 million, will be used to defray our general 
and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with 
securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until 
a business combination is completed.

Neither we nor any other person or entity will pay any of our existing
stockholders, directors or officers or any entity with which they are
affiliated, any finder's fee or other compensation for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with a business combination; provided, however, that
we are permitted to pay a finder's fee or other compensation to Shrem, Fudim,
Kelner & Co. Ltd. and/or to Shrem, Fudim, Kelner - Technologies Ltd. should they
provide us services prior to or in connection with a business combination.
However, our existing stockholders, directors and officers will receive
reimbursement for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with our organization, this offering and activities on our behalf,
such as participating in the offering process, identifying a potential target
operating business and performing due diligence on a suitable business
combination. We have not reser ved any specific amount for such payments, which
may have the effect of reducing the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf. In addition, since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons for
periods after a business combination.

In the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business
combination within 18 months after consummation of this offering (or within 24
months after the consummation of this offering if a letter of intent, agreement
in principle or definitive agreement has been executed within 18 months after
consummation of this offering and the business combination relating thereto has
not yet been consummated within such 18-month period), public stockholders will
be entitled to receive the amount in our trust account, including the amount
representing the deferred portion of the underwriters' fee, plus any remaining
net assets. Public stockholders voting against a business combination will also
be entitled to convert their stock into a pro rata share (based on the number of
units sold in this offering) of the amount held in the trust account, including
the amount held in the trust account representing the deferred portion of the
underwri ters' fee, but excluding the sum of one-half of the interest earned on
the trust account, net of taxes payable on such interest, that will be released
to us on a monthly basis to fund our working capital requirements, up to a
maximum of $2.0 million, and the $380,000 of proceeds held outside of the trust
account, if the business combination is approved and consummated. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right to or interest of any
kind in the trust account.

In the event of our liquidation, as described above, our existing stockholders,
directors and officers will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
solely with respect to any shares of common stock which they purchased in this
offering or following the consummation of this offering."

total approximately $1,711.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses which are payable by us.

    We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital, reduction of debt
and for possible acquisitions of complementary businesses and consolidation of
the ownership of our subsidiaries. Specifically, we may use all or part of the
proceeds of the ADS offering towards any of the following purposes:

   •  Our current intention to exercise our call option to acquire the Government 
      of India’s remaining 29.5% ownership interest in HZL (or 26.0% if the       
      Government of India exercises in full its right to sell 3.5% of HZL to HZL  
      employees), which became exercisable on April 11, 2007 and remains          
      exercisable thereafter so long as the Government of India has not sold its  
      remaining interest pursuant to a public offer of its shares. If we exercise 
      this call option, the exercise price will be equal to the fair market value 
      of the Government of India’s shares as determined by an independent         
      appraiser, which may take into consideration a number of factors including  
      the current market price of HZL’s shares. Based solely on the market price  
      of HZL’s shares on the BSE on June 18, 2007 of Rs. 681.00 ($15.80) per share
      and not including the other factors that the independent appraiser may      
      consider, one possible estimation of the exercise price to acquire all of   
      the Government of India’s 124,795,059 shares of HZL would be                
      Rs. 84,985 million ($1,971.8 million). If the Government of India sells its 
      remaining ownership interest in HZL through a public offer, we may look 
      into alternative means of increasing our ownership interest in HZL. In 
      addition.
   •  Entering the commercial power generation business in India by building the  
      first phase, totaling 2,400 MW, of a thermal coal-based power facility in   
      the State of Orissa, India through our wholly-owned subsidiary Sterlite     
      Energy, at a cost of approximately Rs. 76,028 million ($1,764.0 million) 
      over the next three years for a total project cost of Rs. 81,890 million    
      ($1,900.0 million) over four years. We expect that the proceeds from this   
      offering will be used towards only a portion of this project as we expect   
      that a significant part, currently estimated to be approximately 70%, of    
      this project will be funded by external debt, the equity contribution for   
      the project is expected to be spread out over the four years following      
      commencement of this project in 2006 and we intend to also use              
      internally-generated capital towards this project.                          
  
   •  A reduction of debt in an amount of up to Rs. 6,465 million                 
      ($150.0 million).                                                           
  
   •  Acquiring complementary businesses that we determine to be attractive       
      opportunities, though we have no agreements or commitments for material     
      acquisitions of any businesses as of the date of this prospectus.           


    The amounts that we actually expend for these and other purposes and for
working capital will vary significantly depending on a number of factors,
including the timing and size of capital expenditures and possible exercise of
our call option, future revenue growth, if any, and the amount of cash that we
generate from operations. As a result, we will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds of the ADS offering. Pending their use, we intend
to invest our net proceeds in high quality interest-bearing investments."

to eliminate the following debt, interest and warrant redemption obligations;

     •   Approximately $1,205,000 of principal and interest, issued to Montgomery
         Capital Partners, L.P. (""Montgomery Capital"") pursuant to the loan
         agreement with Montgomery Capital, dated February 28, 2006 (the
         ""Montgomery Loan"") which accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum and
         matures on the earlier of the close of a major financing or February 28,
         2008. Montgomery Capital has also requested redemption of 117,647 warrants
         issuable under the Montgomery Loan at the time of repayment thereof at an
         aggregate redemption price of $150,000, which we have the option of paying
         either in cash or by issuing 31,250 shares of our common stock; and

     •   Up to $2,500,000 in principal amount of our outstanding 15% notes issued
         between April and October 2006 to certain accredited investors (the
         ""Convertible Notes"").

     The proceeds of the Montgomery Loan and the Convertible Notes were used for
working capital purposes. In the event that we fail to repay this loan and
redeem the warrants associated with the Montgomery Loan at the closing of this
offering, the terms of the Montgomery Loan require that we issue shares to
Montgomery Capital upon repayment of the loan. To the extent that the holders of
the Convertible Notes elect to convert their notes, the proceeds otherwise
allocated to their repayment will instead be used for working capital and
general expenses."

     We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time. We intend to
repay an aggregate of approximately $3,750,000 from the proceeds of the offering
to eliminate the following debt, interest and warrant redemption obligations;

     •   Approximately $1,205,000 of principal and interest, issued to Montgomery
         Capital Partners, L.P. (""Montgomery Capital"") pursuant to the loan
         agreement with Montgomery Capital, dated February 28, 2006 (the
         ""Montgomery Loan"") which accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum and
         matures on the earlier of the close of a major financing or February 28,
         2008. Montgomery Capital has also requested redemption of 117,647 warrants
         issuable under the Montgomery Loan at the time of repayment thereof at an
         aggregate redemption price of $150,000, which we have the option of paying
         either in cash or by issuing 31,250 shares of our common stock; and

     •   Up to $2,500,000 in principal amount of our outstanding 15% notes issued
         between April and October 2006 to certain accredited investors (the
         ""Convertible Notes"").

     The proceeds of the Montgomery Loan and the Convertible Notes were used for
working capital purposes. In the event that we fail to repay this loan and
redeem the warrants associated with the Montgomery Loan at the closing of this
offering, the terms of the Montgomery Loan require that we issue shares to
Montgomery Capital upon repayment of the loan. To the extent that the holders of
the Convertible Notes elect to convert their notes, the proceeds otherwise
allocated to their repayment will instead be used for working capital and
general expenses."

common stock in this offering and the sale of 4,250,000 shares of our common
stock in the concurrent private placement will approximate $93 million ($100
million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), after
deducting underwriting discounts and our estimated offering expenses. This
amount includes $44.6 million to be received from the concurrent private
placement to the private purchasers. This estimate assumes a public offering
price of $10.50 per share. We will not pay any discounts or commissions with
respect to shares that are sold to the private purchasers in the concurrent
private placement.

We expect that the net proceeds will ultimately be used to fund the equity
portion of the construction costs of our Alta plant. However, prior to the time
funds are required at Alta, we may use them to repay or defer borrowings under
our bank construction loans for the Wood River and Fairmont plants. To the
extent we feel we have sufficient liquidity, we may use a portion of the net
proceeds to repay outstanding subordinated debt.

We intend to borrow up to approximately $130 million of additional debt to
finance the remaining costs of construction of our Alta plant. Such
required borrowing would be increased to the extent we use a portion of the net
proceeds to repay outstanding subordinated debt. As funds are required for the
construction, we expect to borrow these funds under existing or subsequent bank
facilities, which, in combination with proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement and internal cash flow, would fund such
expenditures.

Borrowings under our bank facility will bear interest at a variable rate based
upon LIBOR or an alternate base rate, at our option, and will mature in 2014,
assuming timely completion of our Wood River and Fairmont facilities. Borrowings
under our subordinated loan agreement will bear interest at an annual rate of
15.0% and will mature in 2015. See ‘‘Risk factors — We expect to incur a
significant amount of indebtedness to construct our facilities, a substantial
portion of which will be secured by our assets’’. As of March 31, 2007, we had
no outstanding borrowings under our bank facility and $18 million of outstanding
borrowings under our subordinated loan agreement."

      Yingli, which would, subject to obtaining relevant PRC regulatory approvals 
      and registrations, increase our equity interest in Tianwei Yingli from

   •  approximately US$180 million to fund a majority of the planned expansion of 
      Tianwei Yingli’s manufacturing capacity for the production of polysilicon

   •  the remaining amount for other general corporate purposes, such as potential
      strategic acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, products and

   We have not yet finalized all of our anticipated expenditures and therefore
cannot provide definitive estimates of the exact amounts to be used for each of
the purposes discussed above. The amounts and timing of any expenditure will
vary depending on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive
and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business.
Accordingly, our management will have significant discretion in the allocation
of the net proceeds we will receive for this offering. Depending on future
events and other changes in the business climate, we may determine at a later
time to use the net proceeds for different purposes.

    Pending the use of our net proceeds, we intend to place the net proceeds in
short-term bank deposits.

    Since we are an offshore holding company, we will need to make capital
contributions or loans to Tianwei Yingli such that the net proceeds of the
offering can be used in the manner described above. Such capital contributions
and loans are subject to a number of limitations and approval processes under
PRC laws and regulations, and, in limited circumstances, consent of Tianwei
Baobian, holder of the minority equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. Tianwei
Baobian has consented to the use of proceeds described above. We cannot assure
you that we can obtain the approvals from the relevant governmental authorities,
or complete the registration and filing procedures required to use our net
proceeds as described above, in each case on a timely basis, or at all. 

    We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders. Other than as set forth above, we will not pay to any of our
affiliates any of the proceeds received by us from the issuance and sale of
ADSs."

offering will be approximately $165.2 million, at an initial public offering
price of $13.00 per share, and after deducting the underwriting discount and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment
option to purchase additional shares in this offering is exercised in full we
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $190.5 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for working capital
and other general corporate purposes, including to finance our growth, develop
new products, fund capital expenditures, or to expand our existing business
through acquisitions of other businesses, products or technologies. However, we
do not have agreements or commitments for any acquisitions at this time.

In addition, we may choose to repay our credit facilities, including:

However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any specific repayments
related to these credit facilities at this time.

The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several factors,
including progress in our research and development efforts and the amount of
cash used throughout our organization. Pending use of proceeds from this
offering, we intend to invest the proceeds in a variety of capital preservation
investments, including short- and intermediate-term interest bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

approximately $98.6 million, based on the initial public offering price of
$12.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares, we estimate that we will receive an
additional $17.6 million in net proceeds. At the public offering price of $12.00
per share, the selling stockholders will receive $17.1 million from their sale
of our common stock in this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount.
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the
selling stockholders. Our president and chief executive officer is selling
shares of common stock in this offering.

     We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital
and other general corporate purposes, which may include financing our growth,
developing new products, and funding capital expenditures, acquisitions and
investments. In addition, the other principal purposes for this offering are to:

        º create a public market for our common stock;

        º facilitate our future access to the public capital markets;

        º increase our visibility in our markets;

        º provide liquidity for our existing stockholders;

        º improve the effectiveness of our equity compensation plans in
          attracting and retaining key employees; and

        º enhance our ability to acquire other businesses, products or
          technologies.

We have not yet determined with any certainty the manner in which we will
allocate these net proceeds. Management will retain broad discretion in the
allocation and use of the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and
timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors,
including the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and
technological developments, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. For
example, if we were to expand our operations more rapidly than anticipated by
our current plans, a greater portion of the proceeds would likely be used for
the construction and expansion of facilities, working capital and other capital
expenditures. Alternatively, if we were to engage in an acquisition that
contained a significant cash component, some or all of the proceeds might be
used for that purpose.

     Although we may use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or
investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our
business, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter
into any acquisitions or make any investments. We cannot assure you that we will
make any acquisitions or investments in the future.

     Pending specific utilization of the net proceeds as described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term investment grade

——————
(1) Research and development expenditures includes expenses incurred in connection
with development of our own pharmacogenomic diagnostic tests.

(2)Business expansion expenditures include establishing testing facilities and
sales and marketing efforts in the United Kingdom, China, Japan and India, and
potential related joint ventures, licensing or other strategic alliances for
technologies or product candidates. In connection with establishing these
facilities, we will need approximately $5,500,000 for start-up costs and
equipment purchases. We do not anticipate the need to obtain additional sources
of funds to establish these facilities.

(3) We expect that general corporate and working capital expenditures will include,
among other potential uses: (i) non-sales, non-marketing and non-R&D related
personnel costs, including the costs of additional employees that we expect to
add to our administrative staff following the closing of this offering; (ii) the
additional costs of being a public company including audit fees, legal fees and
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and (iii) the remainder, if any,
for general working capital.

The allocation of the net proceeds of the offering set forth above represents
our estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding industry
and general economic conditions, our future revenues and expenditures and the
establishment of testing facilities and/or offices in certain European and Asian
countries.

Investors are cautioned, however, that expenditures may vary substantially from
these estimates. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management,
who will have broad discretion regarding the application of the proceeds of this
offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including the status of our research and development efforts,
the timing of regulatory submissions, the amount of cash generated by our
operations, the amount of competition we face and how successful we are with
obtaining any required licenses and entering into collaboration arrangements. We
may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this
offering for other purposes.

Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds include:

† the existence of other opportunities or the need to take advantage of changes in
timing of our existing activities;

† the need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase or eliminate existing
initiatives due to, among other things, changing market conditions and
competitive developments; and/or

† if strategic opportunities of which we are not currently aware present
themselves (including acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and other similar
transactions).

From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate
continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of
resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being optimized. Pending
such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in direct and
guaranteed obligations of the United States, interest-bearing, investment-grade
instruments or certificates of deposit."

mid-point of the range reflected on the cover page of this prospectus, and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses. Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering

offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the
same. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering.

by us would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by
approximately $23.3 million, assuming that the assumed initial public offering
price remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We do not expect
that a change in the offering price or the number of shares by these amounts
would have a material effect on our uses of the proceeds from this offering,

to our preparation for marketing, promotion and expansion of our specialty sales
force and approximately $10.0 million for production of initial commercial 
quantities of Luvox CR;

•approximately $25.0 million to fund our Phase III pivotal clinical trials of 
JZP-6 through the completion of the first Phase III clinical trial, after which,
if the trial is successful, we would need an estimated $50.0 million to complete
development and commercial launch of JZP-6; and

•the remainder to fund continued development of and feasibility activities  for
our portfolio of clinical and early-stage product candidates during the next 12
to 18 months, as well as working capital, capital expenditures and other general
corporate purposes. The completion of development activities and commercial 
launch of each of our early stage product candidates would require substantial
additional funds.

We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the potential acquisition or
in-licensing of, or investment in, products, product candidates, or companies
that complement our business, although we have no current understandings,
commitments or agreements to do so.

We may also seek to obtain debt or other non-equity financing for a portion of
the costs to launch and commercialize Luvox CR, to complete the development and
planned commercial launch of JZP-6, to fund continued development and
commercialization of our portfolio of clinical and early-stage product
candidates and/or for the acquisition or in-licensing of, or investment in,
products, product candidates, or companies that complement our business. We have
no current understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any such
potential financing.

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering.

The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several factors,
including whether and when Solvay obtains regulatory approval of Luvox CR, the
success of our research and development programs and clinical trials, 
expenditures to acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates,
our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements that reduce our
expenses, any settlement of the U.S. Attorney's Office investigation of Orphan 
Medical's promotion of Xyrem, future sales growth, cash generated from future 
operations and actual expenses to operate our business. Pending their uses, we 
plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short- and 
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government.

While we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities and the net proceeds from this offering, and interest earned thereon,
together with anticipated revenues from product sales, royalties and funding
that we expect to receive from our current collaboration arrangement with UCB,
will be sufficient to satisfy our current operations through at least the next
12 to 18 months, we expect to raise additional funds within this period of time
through development financings, collaborations, or public or private debt or
equity financings. In addition, we do not expect that our existing capital
resources and the net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to enable
us to fund the completion of the development of our current product candidates,
and we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations
and to continue to develop our product portfolio, acquire or in-license
additional products and product candidates, and launch and market our products."
